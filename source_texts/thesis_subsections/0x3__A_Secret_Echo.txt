0x3. A Secret Echo

Commenting upon this tautological value system that the scientiﬁc industry is, Wagner remarks that “our massed libraries of ethnography and theory are in this respect learned reverberations of vital critical earthquakes” (Wagner 1981, 152). One can invoke that theory-quakes are unlearned echoes that break open or fracture the circularity of enclosed spaces that reverberate the violence inﬂicted upon the victims. Conceptualization of violence as “roaring, rumbling, grumbling, or murmuring” is also a violence of conceptualization, one that is apparently justiﬁed by the persistence of violence in a continuum that vibrates across “spatial, temporal, and material ﬁelds” (Navaro-Yashin 2020, 10-11). Reverberation as a relational eﬀect is produced when the sound is reﬂected through material surfaces within an enclosed space as it persists or prolongs. What distinguishes reverberation from echo is the former’s continuity mediated by material surfaces and the conﬁnement of it within an enclosed space as it would have dispersed in an open space; whereas the latter is said to be more discrete or as “the sharp awareness of repetition” (Harvey 2020, 296). 

A tracing of reverb and echo through history and mythology might suggest that the latter is generally a phenomenon of the ‘natural’ world, whereas the former ﬁgures as a secondary quality of the built environment: In a sense, there is a connection between “reverberancy” and political power through its seats and sites whether it be sacred or secular; whereas echo often ﬁgures as “dispossessed and mocking”, which resonates in their gendered qualities as male voice and female voice (Doyle 2005, 40). Reverb gives space and depth to sound through its multiple reﬂections on hard material surfaces, gives color or timbre; whereas echo poses an ‘atavistic’ suggestion of animism, in terms of a talking nonhuman world, which in its ambiguity is “an irreconcilable dualism, while simultaneously hinting at a transcendent monism, that all in fact may be at base be one” (Doyle 2005, 39). The conﬁned spaces of temples, mosques, palaces or houses architectonically amplify the sound of the seats or sites of power, but the dispossessed and mocking voice of echo poses a disturbance or a fracture to political speech and transforms it. 

Through an analogy with the reverberation of sound, an architectonics of violence is laid bare in the edited volume titled Reverberations (Navaro-Yashin et al. 2020). However, when the building collapses what is required by such dynamics is perhaps an “anarchitectonics” that fractures the enclosed space, and diﬀracts the dispersion of acoustic waves so as to bring about a new echo-logical amplitude. This echo posed in terms of echo-logical dispersion is not an echo in transcendence as in a “sharp awareness of repetition”, which is just a validation of transcendence, but an echo in immanence that is against the double transcendence of auto-position. The sacred or secular spaces of conﬁnement that reverberate the sounds of violence are bound to collapse, which is the presence of the imaginary number that is its essence. Reverberation, understood as the superposition of echoes, is a perception of distortion (Harvey 2020, 296); whereas the diﬀractive echo-logical dispersion that fractures the conﬁned spaces of violence might be posed as a distortion of perception, which is cognitive estrangement through the theory of cultural tectonics. If it is said to be violent, it is theoretically violent against suﬃciency and hierarchy.

What does an earthquake and human speech have in common? Can earth speak, can humans quake? From an undulatory perspective, they both produce waves propagating acoustic energy through various media. From a more particulate perspective, the diﬀerence between seismic waves and human voice is the frequency (Hunstad et al. 2013). The elastic body of the earth produces two type of waves that travel through its interior: the primary compressional waves that are longitudinal, and secondary shear waves that are transversal. These waves are superposed as various surface waves characterized by their polarization.  Human body, on the other hand, could be argued to produce sound waves that originate “in the contained resonating chambers of the throat and head” and lets out “the inner reverberation into a volume that surrounds” itself (Wagner 2001, 137). In this sense, the mouth acts as the opening which diﬀracts the superposed echoes within the body towards the surface of experience, as faults diﬀract the acoustic energy carried to the surface by the body waves of the earth. Perhaps the roaring, grumbling or murmuring as sound analogues of violence is not only metaphors for the reverberation of violence, but also violent echoes diﬀracted through these openings. 

Humans and the world violently resonate like echoes of codes: ”Coded-coding, each thing reverberates in every other thing, coding-coded” (Serres, 2010, 135). Could it be the case that sounds originating from the from depths, ”the dark bowels of the ground” which has been interpreted as ”the words of phantoms coming back” (Serres 2010, 35), only lay bare how human as an earthly being, humanizes earth. This statement ﬁgures the human as an aleatory subject or as an aleatory calculation of lived experience: Human and earth are not opposed to one another, they are rather in superposition, as variables lowered to the state of becomings, no longer as quantitative or as ﬁxed essences, ”they are aﬀected by the imaginary number and are already non-commutative becomings” (Laruelle 2021,6-7). The secret of echo neither serves for the aﬃrmation of ﬁxation with self, nor for the validation of its division and synthesis, ‘self-knowledge’ or call it a ‘life’; it is more a hearing aﬀected by the imaginary number, a kind of ”hearing-in-rhythm” that is an ”ecological anticause” in that rhythm is not a matter of metrics or recurrence, but it is identical to hearing-in-rhythm (Szepanski 2020, 245), or rather it is idempotent (1+1=1, one-in-one=one) (Laruelle 2021, 28). To suspend frequency in-rhythm is to enter the ﬁeld of non-frequency politics which stresses that ”the relation between the diﬀerent speed of waves and the maxima of intensity or timeless degree of diﬀerent waves” form a dispersion (Szepanski 2020, 248).

Seismopolitics arises from the suspension of frequency that diﬀerentiates seismic waves and human sound. If indeed the theory of cultural tectonics poses a distortion of perception, the arising seismopolitics prevents it from becoming another perception. This is because the implications of the suspension of frequency is such that the collapsing gap between active seismic, as ‘artiﬁcial’ seisms, and passive seismic, as ‘natural’ seisms, disperses into what has been called seismic noise. It is deﬁned as ”the undesirable part of seismic data that is not signal, and signal is what ﬁts our conceptual model” (Kumar and Ahmed 2021), whereby the disturbance or failure presupposes a conceptual model that excludes noise and its composition, ”thus thinking the real always as a correlate of thought” (Szepanski 2020, 245). The example of such a model can lead one to reassert that “the seismograph is our artiﬁcial ear” (Hunstad et al. 2013, 534), which is a statement that can be inverted as ‘the ear is a natural seismograph’, one that reveals nothing and which seismopolitics makes obsolete as artiﬁcial and natural are just vectors for non-commutative becomings of seismograph and ear. Seismic noise is indiﬀerent to models, inversions or modeling processes as it is a generic name for relatively persistent vibration. 

“The noise begins the rhythm that smooths out the noise; the rhythm erases the noise that destroys the rhythm“ (Serres 2010, 113). This is a statement that could guide us in terms of what is at stake with the considerations of seismic noise and hearing-in-rhythm. We could transform it as the following: Seismic noise originates hearing-in-rhythm, which is a wave carrying itself as a trace for itself, that ﬂattens seismic noise; hearing-in-rhythm traverses seismic noise that disperses hearing-in-rhythm. If we could bring about a concept such as ‘generic seismicity’ into discussion, its formula would resonate with this remark: “There is indeed a chain of mountains or undulations, but there is also the seismic shift that crosses these mountains, making them rise and be displaced“ (Laruelle 2009). And if we took the secret of echo seriously, its ‘animism’ that brings forth an irreversible duality and an aﬀective monism, we would arrive at an underdetermined conception of humanity as generic, or human as a probable subject; which is put forth algebraically as X=human and which renders the human as indeﬁnite (Laruelle 2021). This conception opens up the ﬁrst phase of our ‘echology’, which is the theory of cultural tectonics and its complementary seismopolitics. 

<…ﬁnds oneself in an action… an action one had not even dared to think before… how does a human ﬁnd oneself in an action? Does a human ﬁnd oneself in an action that has not crossed one’s dreams? No, such a thing cannot happen. At least in a situation that one has planned or that does not exceed one’s imagination, a human can preserve one’s mental and spiritual strength. Human… human… who is this human? Human is a generic name, it can be used under various conditions to refer to a variety of individuals. Instead of ‘human’, you can also call it ‘X’. If it could be called ‘X’, I would be feeling myself very happy about this assumption. Because I am a mathematician and in my current situation, all I hope to see is what has happened to me as consisting of solvable functions of an unknown ‘X’. As such, numerous nightmares will have never happened…(Atay 1998, 19)>
