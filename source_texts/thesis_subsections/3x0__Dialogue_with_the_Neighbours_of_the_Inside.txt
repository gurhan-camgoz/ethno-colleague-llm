3.ANTHROPOLOGY FROM THE BORDERS OF THE OUTSIDE

3x0. Dialogue with the Neighbors of the Inside

<Greek cultural anthropologist Nadia Seremetakis brings together various fragments from her multi-sited and self-reflexive ethnographic explorations in Sensing the Everyday: Dialogues from Austerity Greece (2019). For Seremetakis, anthropology is best understood as to mean dialogue, which is best reflected in her “antinomic subject position” throughout the book that leads to her recognition of the positionality of “a native or indigenous ethnographer” who is at the same time a “diasporic, American-trained, post-Boasian anthropologist”, as it exemplifies the placed emphasis on the dialogic relationship between her various ethnographic projects and the discipline in its broader sense (Seremetakis 2019, 5). The various montages that are juxtaposed in this book are based on fieldwork experiences and observations of the quotidian within the era of crisis, as a mixture of theoretical analyses with ethnographic data collected over years. The focus on the everyday life within the context of socio-economic crisis of Greece is employed through a lens that takes into account the fracturing effects of this crisis with its corresponding saturation of the everyday life with insecurities.
Immersion within this interstitial analysis is evinced out of the “gaps, silences and dead spaces” that operate in this non-signifying space. This encapsulation of the quotidian within the macro logical is ultimately a structural effect and political technology of the superstructure according to Seremetakis, who is ultimately interested in the ethnography of the quotidian as it is rendered as lacking security. One of the employed methods can effectively be called “the excavation of historical experience of fracture” which attempts at a politicization of the micro logical by exposing the social fictioning of the social reality, transforming the power (puissance) of the everyday experiences into a reservoir of alternative perceptions of reality as the aim of the ethnographic project (Seremetakis 2019, 3). It is a political task under the conditions of globalization and neocolonial practices that seek to produce the homogenous and totalizing authority of the sameness, framed as a pseudo-culture devoid of meaning. The focus on the everyday does not effectuate a sacralization of every day life nor its recession into a foreclosed zone outside the reach of the political violence. The quotidian is made concrete as the material forces of fragmentary and fragmenting kind, which are performatively enacted in the style of the book as it is best conceived as an assemblage of fragments, and not as a story shaped ethnography told in a linear fashion.

Perhaps this book review could be devised as a kaleidoscopic exploration of these constellations which produce ethnographic affects as well as the initiation of a dialogical relationship that converges both methodically and thematically with my ethnographic project. The highlighted quotidian processes that are on the spaces of border, spaces of trauma, and the journey of antiphonic witnessing and memory have concrete resonances with the project I am trying to pursue. Out of the many ethnographic miniatures that are juxtaposed within the context of this book, the amplified resonances that guide my exploration thematically involve the spatialization of memory, the archaeology of non-standard forms of language, the sensory experiences of physical and social disasters which Seremetakis talks about in the context of “eruption of death in the city” that accompany the “eruption of the earth and the death of the city itself” (Seremetakis 2019, 6). The ethnographic explorations of Seremetakis in Kalamata after an earthquake has devastated the city, provides an excellent guiding thread for my ethnographic project focusing on the earthquake that has devastated my hometown in 1999 in Turkey. This perfect point for establishing a dialogical relationship between experiences of trauma within the face of disasters actually reflects the efforts of the earthquake diplomacy that was established between Greece and Turkey after the earthquakes of 1999 in respective countries.

Dialogue with Seremetakis allows me to move past the dominant public culture and mnemotechnics of remembering and forgetting it dictates, and focus on the quotidian processes and the lived experiences of the everyday in dealing with what she calls third stream memory or anamnesis. These alternative forms of public reminiscence that are excavated from the ruined space of a post-disaster city are simultaneously an archaeology of non-standard forms of language that come to life between the porous borders of life and death as well as bodies and concepts. Seremetakis is interested in the alternative memories of collective experience which are other than the ones that are archived by various institutions and media. She suggests that memory is in fact “sensory and embedded in matter”, as it can be found in the affective relationship between places and biographies, stored and miniaturized within objects that resurface sedimented emotions and narratives, it is linked to various senses: “The urban space dismembered by disaster becomes a body without organs” (Seremetakis 2019, 56).

Seremetakis’ reflections on disaster victims and the diagnostics she puts forward in terms of post-disaster flexible citizenship with its principles in neoliberal models models of citizenship, enables her to reveal how these people have become “internal refugees” in their own national spaces, being rendered “infra-political”, liminal and homeless. But this reflection of victims is not mediatic witnessing which is appropriative according to Seremetakis. She contrasts this mediatic witnessing with antiphonic witnessing and remarks that the media is not interested in creating public memory, whereas antiphonic witnessing establishing dialogue is an engagement with an other, a “creation of a separate place” as a prerequisite for witnessing others and being witnessed by them. (Seremetakis 2019, 74) The dialogue initiated with Seremetakis in this review can create this separate place as it is fruitful in terms of a shared sensibility within the context of socio-economic crises of the everyday.

Overall, the book is a very dense and condensed assemblage of ethnographic explorations of an anthropologist whose career spans over long years of engagement with the field and the discipline. I have chosen to focus on the most relevant aspects of these fragments for my ethnographic project and have unfortunately left behind massive parts not included in this review. I have chosen to focus on the employed methodologies in terms of the ethnographic explorations and have tried to convey the most resonant themes that are explored with these methodologies in mind. The book has not only initiated dialogue and antiphonic witnessing with Seremetakis but also facilitated the dialogue with my ‘self’ and its internalized other. It has helped the creation of a separate place for reflection on my own everyday experiences and the experiences in the fieldwork...>

This book review was written as a part of the Interpreting Data Anthropologically course. Seremetakis is an important influence, not just as a part of the master’s program in Leuven, but also in the bachelor’s program in Istanbul. Our first interaction with Seremetakis was in the Social Memory course that was in the Sociology program in Bogazici University, in which we have read a part from the The Senses Still (1994). Just as a watery fruit takes her to a journey in her memories in that book, reading and listening to her has made us think a lot about how to deal the problem of memory. In the beginning of this semester, Seremetakis gave the inaugural lecture for the Anthropology program in Leuven. There was a sense of confusion as to the title of her inaugural lecture which was “Anthropology from the Borders of the Inside“. As an homage to this title, we have decided to name this phase of the present study “Anthropology from the Borders of the Outside“. The reasons for giving such a title to the present phase of our study is a sort of “disagreement“ on the margins of the everyday, a fruitful one in that, to produce an effect that will become clearer as we continue. The border of Turkey and Greece is a reflection of such a disagreement, one that is immensely close yet also so far away.

 <If the European Union can be thought as a castle, it feels like Greece stands on the borders of the inside whereas Turkey stands on the borders of outside. Greece seems so beautiful from the Aegean shores of Anatolia, yet our entry as Turkish citizens is very problematic. Before I have come to study in Leuven, I had never been to Greece in my life. There is a very intimate relationship and history these two countries share with one another, yet to be denied easy entry to a land that is so close but so far away has always raveled my mind. I had a personal aspiration to go to Greece ever since 1999 Marmara Earthquake. Right after the earthquake, Greeks were the first to send us help. I remember receiving boxes of aid; clothes, toys, pencils, notebooks that were coming from Greece. Put yourself in my situation, a small child that has lost everything to wreckage: every toy, every clothing, every piece that was so personal to me got trapped under the rubble. In a sense, with each new item that was in the box of aid we opened, there was a new potentiality to reconstruct our livelihoods. There was also quite a powerful earthquake that hit Athens 20 days after the Marmara Earthquake. And Turkey was the first to sent help to Greece as well. Two countries have an official history of Earthquake diplomacy.

In a ‘true’ anthropological fascination with the cultural other, so to speak, I initially wanted to make the present study about this Earthquake diplomacy by researching the not-so-official aspects of the the earthquake intimacy the people from these countries share. However, I have found it very difficult to find resources to pursue an engaged fieldwork in Greece, as well as a linguistic limitation in terms of my lack of knowledge in Greek language. Yet, this did not stop me from visiting Greece given that I now had the Schengen visa to be freely moving inside the European Union. I seized upon this fact and paid a visit to the city of Phytagoreio in the island of Samos. So many asylum seekers try to make that boat trip from Turkey to Greece, and in a lot of these cases, their boats are pushed back to where they are coming from. Others do not end up so lucky, sometimes their dead bodies are washed up onto a shore. But that little magical residence permit and a few hundred euros can secure your visit to the islands of Greek; you are more than welcome to visit these islands by boat if you have the permit and the money to reach these islands. Perhaps, this little fact was enough to make me sick, or perhaps it was due to something entirely different, but I have spent most of my time in Pythagoreio vomiting and shivering with a fever.

In other times where I wasn’t feeling so sick, I have enjoyed the beautiful sea and the delicious food as a tourist. I was surprised when we got approached by a waiter who was working in a restaurant that recognized our speech and started talking with us in Turkish. But then I realized that this shouldn’t be so surprising to anyone who has been there, because you can literally see the mainland of Turkey from this island and it is much closer to it than it is to the Greek mainland. There are thousands of tourists coming from Turkey to this island. I didn’t assume any ‘anthropologist’ identity in this conversation and I have found this to be a relief. I casually asked the “interlocutor“ whether he was here on the island when the 2020 Aegean Sea earthquake happened. He said it was a powerful one but the Aegean Sea is like a cradle that is endlessly swinging, and that you can tell by the actions of the tourists, in terms of how they react to the shaking, whether they have ever experienced an earthquake before or not. I thanked him for sharing this “ethnographic observation“ with me. He was more of an anthropologist in this sense than I could ever be on this island.>

And perhaps, this is our disagreement with Seremetakis. Looking back at the notes taken during the inaugural lecture, she differentiates the anthropologist from a tourist and one can see the reasons behind this differentiation. But there is a sense in which a transposition like the one told above can happen in the context of a touristic activity, and this is not something that should be neglected even if you are ideologically against tourism. The waiter that shares his ethnographic observation is producing anthropological knowledge, whether he assumes the identity of anthropologist or not. He is making observations as to how people react to earthquakes and figuring out who has been in an earthquake before or not, based on the observations he has made. He has seen enough earthquakes on this island and enough people visiting this island to be saying something like that. Are we at fault here for including this interaction in our study? This is debatable. But ethnographic observation and “dialogue“ is not a property of anthropologists, and for the purpose of such demonstration, the interaction above finds its place in the present study. We are not claiming the ownership of this ethnographic observation nor the anthropological knowledge here. We might be ‘condemned’ to be perceived as tourists when we are traveling from anywhere to everywhere, and we find no use in pushing for this differentiation between tourists and anthropologists for any reason whatsoever. It still sounds like the last bit of hope and value that the anthropologist attaches to one’s endeavor in order to be able to say that one’s different from the others.
