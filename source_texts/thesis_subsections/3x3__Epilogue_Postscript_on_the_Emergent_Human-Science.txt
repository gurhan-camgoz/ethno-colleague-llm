3x3. Epilogue/Postscript on the Emergent Human-Science

The present study is devised as a 4x4 matrix, where each chapter can be put into an operation with any other chapter to make up various phases. The way it is presented here is just one of the ways it could have been presented, as any other way of presentation would be possible in other circumstances. 

In the ﬁrst phase, we have introduced the central concepts of the study as the theory of cultural tectonics and the complementary seismopolitics. If the theory of cultural tectonics is an attempt at horizontal placing of the concepts we have dealt with in the ﬁrst phase, the arising seismopolitics is the vertical seizure of these concepts that indexes them as immanent to the present study. Earthquakes have aﬀected humans as far back as we can think of anything that remotely resembles humans, and our miniature conceptual history of earthquakes is just one set of these aﬀections that we have detected out of countless interactions that could have been actualized and written down. Such a dealing is enabled by the presence of a non-dwelling perspective which is the ‘secret’ echo whispers in one’s ears. 

In the second phase of the study, we have attempted to mark down the movement of our concepts, which is evident by the structure ‘from…to…’ that functioned as a ‘test’ of our concepts in presenting such undertaking within the context of the discipline that is anthropology. We have moved from the canonical formula of Levi-Strauss to reveal the inverted ethnographic function of ‘fractality’; from the ethnographic present to the third-person’s perspective in Marx and Laruelle; from a relation of self-resonance or tautological value exchange towards a conception of fractal identity; and from an anthropological or philosophical conception of ‘measurement’ that comes from observation towards quantum decoherence. 

The third phase of our study has shifted its terrain from dealing with ‘imported’ concepts towards the problematic that cannot be accurately presented due to an impossibility of accurate translation. This is our ‘going native’ phase where we have considered this impossibility not as something restrictive but as an enabling impossibility that is evident from our axiom. We have also presented the method for the corresponding phase through an account of the theory of ‘coordinates of life’. After such deliberation, we have presented a ‘biography of an ordinary anthropologist’ who attempts to write down the present study; who conceives the ‘life in disaster housing projects’ as one of the starting points for such an attempt; as well as dealing with the saturation of daily life in these projects with an ‘Islamic make-up and catastrophe bonds’ that are the re-enchantments of a disenchanted modern life in disaster housing projects. 

In the fourth phase of our study, we have embarked on a dialogue with our neighbors that we share a kind of earthquake intimacy with, swinging from hills of Athens towards the university halls of Leuven, ﬁnding solidarity in the Pangaea of our common dreams or nightmares. And here we are in the epilogue of the ﬁnal phase which can also be read as a postscript on the emergent human-science that we have proposed in the beginning of the third phase where we have considered ‘going native’. The accounts, conversations or coordinates we have given above is the ﬁctionalized reporting of ‘lived experiences’ or echoes that are heard-in-rhythm by suspending the frequency in earthquakes and human speech as the standing wave of rhythmic superposition. 

The present study can be considered as a (counter-)gift to the tautological value system that we observe to have made anthropology drown in its self-image, or to have made it a buzzword that self-resonates in only hearing and speaking (of) itself. If we have employed any critical attitude, it is directed towards such a suﬃciency of the anthropological discipline. And if there were any analyses here, it was certainly not an analysis of the ethnographic data that was presented in the later part of the study. This is a deliberate choice, although it could be regarded as a limitation by some. We acknowledge that all of this might sound counter-intuitive to those people who regard it as a limitation. But this is precisely the point. 

The ‘data’ presented should be regarded as a prolegomena to an upcoming ‘insan-bilim’ (human-science) of the future rather than any anthropology of the past. The reader is not only free to interpret the data as they want, they are encouraged to interpret the data presented in the later part of the study on their own, in hopes that they also might partake in our bringing of this human-science into life. Such is our undertaking of the process that might sound like a terrible joke to some ears, yet as the punchline in this whole proceeding goes: It is not my fault…
