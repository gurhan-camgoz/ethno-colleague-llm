0x2.A Non-Dwelling Perspective

If what is at stake here is not so clear, we can proceed with a perspectival shift to bring into the discussion an anthropologist, Tim Ingold, who gives an account of his shift from a building perspective to a dwelling perspective. Ingold’s account marks his shift from thinking “according to which worlds are made before they are lived in” to thinking “according to which the forms people build, whether in imagination or on the ground, only arise within the current of their life activities” (Ingold 2000, 154). Offering another quasi-Heideggerian solution to the Kantian gap between phenomenon and thing, Ingold’s phenomenological account of dwelling comes to reverse the relationship between building and dwelling, such that the former comes to be encompassed by the latter (Ingold 2000, 185). Heidegger’s etymological and existential approach to the relationship between building, dwelling and thinking guides Ingold to adapt the dwelling perspective as a remedy against the antinomies between “evolution and history, and between biology and culture” (Ingold 2000, 186), such that social relations come to be understood as a subset of ecological relations.

Ingold, following Heidegger, ‘discovers’ that building, that comes to act as a foundation upon which people can dwell, is an illusory foundation because it used to be the other way, the people dwelled in the world so that they could build. There is an affinity to this operation that is in the words of Morton, “what ecological thought must do, then, is unground the human by forcing it back onto the ground” (Morton 2015, 18). Even though Morton and Ingold appear to talk about different things, they seem to talk within an invariant structure. The loss of an illusory foundation in the form of building sounds very much like an effect of an earthquake, but the phenomenological return of the ground sounds like a renewed hallucination, an illusory building hallucinated in the ruins of an older one as a persistent aftershock of an earthquake. “Only because they already dwell therein can they think the thoughts they do” (Ingold 2000, 186) writes Ingold, which leaves one in dismay, wondering the fate of those non-dwelling in Ingold’s account; those who are disabled, exiled, displaced, and victimized in a double sense.

Roy Wagner crafts a formula for what he calls as “the true image of a false relationalism” or simply as quasification: “We not only rationalize” but also “rationalize the fact that we rationalize”, overdetermining the effects of modeling and underdetermining our agency (Wagner 2005, 207). All this could reveal is the inversion inherent in modeling, which would amount to a provisional etymology of the word dwell counteracting Heidegger’s etymological tracing of build, as the former would necessitate its own conceptual history. But as the roots in old English dwellan “to lead into error, deceive, mislead”1 would be so apparent in their intention, we would only go so far as to contemplate on the translation of Heidegger’s wohnen into English as dwelling. That is, if we remain content in the quasification enacted by Tim Ingold, as in granting a benevolent reading to his phenomenological inflection of dwelling and material vitality, would we too become “initiates in the ‘paradigm’” by consciously being led astray, so that scientific disciplines can “sustain the kind of authoritarian hegemony...that passes for most people” (Wagner 2005, 210)?

Laruelle considers dwelling as “a philosophy materialized in miniatures” where “the simple shelter or the cardboard box of the poorest people changes the concept of housing” (Laruelle 2021, 59). A pre-emptive defence against the criminal world is thinking oriented to non-dwelling, a thought under-determined by victims which impoverishes philosophy by taking its foundation within a collapse, that is “the trace of the universal presence of the imaginary number in every intention and in every causality of representation” (Laruelle 2021, 9). This is akin to putting the world in brackets; suspending the decision philosophy holds upon the living, such as Ingold’s decision of boiling down the individual into “animal-in-its-environment” (Ingold 2000, 186); putting the phenomenological return out of play by a theory- quake in a quasi-experimental way. Any ecological anthropology, that deems itself legitimate to project sufficient reasons for efficient causes, falls into ruins in a shock not anticipatable within its own apparatus of capture; and a pre-emptive defence of the human by thinking oriented to non-dwelling is a struggle against this sufficiency of anthropology.

Non-dwelling is considered to be an extension of the concept of dwelling so as not to be deceived. It is not against dwelling nor it destroys the concept. It’s a thought conditioned by those that are under rubble or within a wreckage. It is not the news, nor the truth, and certainly not an inversion between them. No philosophy, no writing, no photograph and no medium can capture it; they can explicitly or implicitly attempt to account for its lack or excess. Ingold or Morton can attempt to account for the so-called Kantian gap between phenomenon and thing by offering philosophical solutions that are based on “division and synthesis” which warrants their “auto-position as the transcendental loop of conceptual thought: a circular and tautological self-sufficiency” (Louis-Klein 2020, 79). Thinking oriented to non- dwelling, or thought conditioned by those disabled, exiled, displaced and victimized does not content itself with taking a snapshot of ruins which more often than not end up being integrated into the machinery of (re)construction plans; it invents more than it constructs or deconstructs. Its invention is a theory-quake that transforms the articulative protocols of the capture-mode (Wagner 2005, 210), which seeks the immanent cause of justice within the victim by rendering the victim all the more discrete and thus all the less forgettable (Laruelle 2015).
