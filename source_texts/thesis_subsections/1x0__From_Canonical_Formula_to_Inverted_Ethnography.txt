1.OSCILLATIONS <…It was some time ago when I was following the same gestures that are present in the writing of these words, clicks and breaks that compose a fragment of chaos, that do not have so much harmony but perhaps a trace of stress of the beat in rhythm. I was maybe sowing the seeds of what will have become this present study, as I was writing my ‘motivation’ for pursuing a degree in Leuven in an anticipative manner. I was oscillating in retrospection when suddenly a persistent high-pitched voice scattered my attention and reassembled it in her movement as it was approaching me. As we exchanged ‘winks’ with the cat, she had bumped her head to my leg, swinging her tail across my leg and then making another high-pitched persistent sound as she proceeded on the wooden tiles, which had dispersed into the room, eventually settling on the ﬂoor in her silence. Little did I know when I didn’t even  think too seriously about this rather ordinary interaction, as I tried to regain my attention on my writing. The noisy silence in the room receded and what ﬁlled the moment was the initial jolt of the quake that hit like a kick from below and raised us on our feet. In sheer catalepsy, our gazes found each other like our legs searching for the ﬂoor they were standing upon. What followed was the shear waves oscillating with us in the deep resonance of our look exchange. In this second look, I recalled an earlier moment, that had raise me up but did not make me think: the cat had been looking down from a window which opens to a critical height which was quite unusual for her as that window wasn’t open most of the time. I remember seeing it from afar, and fearing on her behalf; getting up, walking to the cat to fold her up and close the window. I didn’t think too seriously about this interaction until this second look. Could the cat be saying ‘I told you so’ in this second look? Certainly not, as that would be wrong not once but twice. But my feeling that I did not miss one but two ‘clues’ in her ‘anticipation’ of the seism says a lot about my understanding and says nothing about the cat’s; whereas in retrospect, my ‘motivation’ in anticipation of this study calls forth a movement of thought as the trace for a thought of movement, say, from Istanbul to Leuven…>

1x0. From Canonical Formula to Inverted Ethnography

Having laid down the main axes and a certain layer of concepts that are operative in the approach this study follows, which is a technical ﬁrst step in our procedure; we are now moving to the discuss the generation of ﬁelds upon which our concepts operate. What is guiding our endeavor here, as we were only hinting at it thus far, is the canonical formula of Claude Levi-Strauss for the structural analysis of myth“<fx(a):fy(b)::fx(b):fa-1(y)>“ (Levi-Strauss 1955). What is peculiar about this formula is that it is not a mere metaphor or a rhetorical device, but “one can simultaneously apprehend the formula as a conceptual relation and see it, here and there in the world, stamped in a geometry that human endeavour has envisioned“ (Levi-Strauss 2001, 29). There are two functions in the formula, ‘fx’ and ‘fy’, that “represent the irreconcilable oppositions“ as vectors, which actualize the terms ‘a’ and ‘b’, through which the term ‘b’ becomes the operator that mediates the mechanism and generates “a double twist“ (Maranda 2001, 4). ‘a’ is inverted to become a function of ‘y’, that gets actualized as the term expressed by the function (a-1). In order to echo, if not to reiterate, what has been discussed in [0x3] regarding earthquakes and human speech, we could see the workings of the formula for ourselves:  

fquake(earth):fspeech(human)::fquake(human):fearth-1(speech)

which would read as ‘the earthquake is to the human speech as the human-quake is to the inverted earth function of the speech’. The term ‘human’ appears as the mediating center that operates in the inversion of the term ‘earth’ and the actualization of the speech function. Or conversely, we could try to work the statement ‘the seismograph is our artiﬁcial ear’ through the formula:

fartiﬁcial(seismograph):fnatural(ear)::fartiﬁcial(ear):fseismograph-1(natural)

‘the artiﬁcial seismograph is to the natural ear as the artiﬁcial ear is to the inverted seismographic function of the natural’. The ear is the mediator that acts in the inversion of the term ’seismograph’ and the actualization of the natural function to become the term ‘natural’ for the inverted seismographic function. The canonical formula of Levi-Strauss has inspired various strands of thought such as the Melanesian ethnography, or the so-called ontological turn in anthropology. For example, Mosko discusses a variant of the formula that can be applied to myth and non-myth, for a structural study of ethnographic data that is narrative and non-narrative. This eliminates the double or the additional twist by reformulating the formula as ”<fx(a):fy(b)::fx(b):fy(a)>“, which moves by a ‘recursive inversion’ that retains an analogical expression while also retaining the non-linearity of myth without the double twist. For him, the problem lies with the additional twist of the inverted function (-1) of the ﬁnal member which is ”a product of the ‘transcendental deductions’ among myths of diﬀerent cultures“ (Mosko 1991, 146). Whereas, in his interpretation of the formula Mosko sees sociocultural systems as totalities, and if these total systems as units can be demonstrated to structure around a single formula, then systematic comparison is possible (Mosko 1991, 147).

In other words, Mosko’s variant builds a symmetrical relationship between two sides which sees the variables as “in a commutative group in which every element has order two“ (Morava 2001, 56-57). But as Wagner also suggests, the recursive step stays on the surface if it is a mere validation of reality “wherein the means of representation and the facticity of the represented echo one another“ (Wagner 2001, 211). This is particularly resonant with Martin Holbraad’s discussion of the ‘metarecursive step’ in which the argument has three steps, partly based on Wagnerian notion of invention. Put very broadly, these steps are the following: First, anthropological diﬀerence is assumed by the anthropologist; second, the ‘ﬁeld’ reveals a contradiction of these assumptions by ethnographic alterity; third, a recursive inversion of ‘culture’ as invention, where third step is the argument standing on its own as an anthropological invention. As a whole, this is not a logical necessity but a strategic move as “any contradiction“ between the assumption of anthropological diﬀerence and ethnographic description could do“ (Holbraad 2012, 237-259). Sounds like a single formula for an anthropologist to reinvent the truth, and the truth is reinvention of anthropology in its self-relation. 

Wagner remarks that there is a need “to ‘justify’ the ratio between the two conditions set forth by Lévi-Strauss for the canonic formula by ‘drawing them’ to the scale of the expression they describe“ (Wagner 2001, 226), which is akin to a matrix that is a kind of drawing, one that has “the advantage that it can be algebraically manipulated to reveal higher-order structural properties“ (Hage and Array 1983, 6). We could say that Wagner’s fractal person, as a totality that is neither individual nor group (Wagner 1991, 163), acts as the justiﬁcation of the ratio between two sides of the canonical formula, which is the application of fractality to anthropology, one that is generating recursivity. In the variant of Mosko, this can be put as the following: 

falterity(ethnography):ﬀractality(anthropology)::falterity(anthropology):ﬀractality(ethnography)

We could ask just what has changed in the inversion between the canonical formula, which would have posed the last term and function as fethnography-1(fractality). And it is where recursivity comes in, as the inverted ethnographic function of fractality is transformed into the fractality function of ethnography. We could say that the canonical formula variant keeps things open, or untotalizable, as in granting the term ‘fractality’ an inverted ethnographic function. But inserted into the Mosko’s variant we can see this function as the fractality function of ethnography or the self-scaling of ethnography that is ‘any contradiction’. It is as if the anthropologist goes on a ﬁeld to hear the reverberation of his self-resonance which is kind of “an established resonance between diﬀerent orders of representation“ one that is considered as “the representation of representation“ (Wagner 2001, 211). It fears it will drown itself in the time lag implied by this resonance, if it gives an ear to the simplest echo or gives up its dualism. 

We could imagine a scenario in which an anthropologist is ‘conducting’ a ﬁeldwork with a device called the ‘ethnograph’ that records the reﬂections on the ﬁeld. The ﬁeld is structured in a such a way, or at least the account of it is given in such a way, that everyone speaking including the anthropologist is recorded, to give the impression that the ethnograph will record any voice neutrally, and then the anthropologist is assumed to sample these ﬁeld recordings by reﬂexively justifying the positionality on the ﬁeld to rescue ‘a sense of proportion’ (Wagner 2005, 248). But what is inside this ethnograph, is a Wagnerian human bat that is only able to echolocate ‘referents’ that resonate with the frequencies of the anthropologist’s voice which is the ‘meaningfulness’ of direction in his terms (Wagner 2001, 135-137) , or the self resonant frequency. All the other frequencies are rendered as ‘ethnographic noise’ or the undesirable part of ethnographic data. The symbolic obviation of the argument is the argument’s self-grounding as a ‘chiasmus’, where anthropologist invents culture that comes to stand on its own, or at least next to ‘anthropology’, itself a self-standing entity, one that captures the ethnographic alterity to transform itself and invent culture through the fractality of ethnography. 

Whereas, we ﬁnd it more apt to consider the inverted ethnographic function of fractality; which, in retrospect, can account for the autonomy of anthropology without its closure upon itself, as well as rescuing ethnography from being a self-scaling device of the anthropologist, granting its own autonomy. Perhaps it is not ‘culture’ that must be invented to get elevated next to anthropology; rather, it is anthropology which should be brought down, rid of its suﬃciency, to inhere next to ethnography. To ‘inhere’ is not to divide and synthesize, as if ethnography and anthropology are oppositional terms; in-here is the priority of ‘in-sistence’ that links them to Earth, before the decision that divides and synthesizes to link them to World as ‘ex-sistence’ (Laruelle 2021). The World is a self-resonant chamber that reverberates violence for which elevated anthropology and culture sounds like a ‘scientiﬁc exology’ or a science of closure, whereas the inherent stress in the pulse between ethnography and anthropology calls for a ‘radical echology’ that arises as an impulse, or an in-pulse (Szepanski 2020, 249). This pulse does not belong to ethnography nor anthropology, nor it is an established resonance between the two. 

As we have shown in [0x3], the suspension of frequency in-rhythm allows us to move beyond the opposition of these irreconcilable dualisms by considering them as vectors in superposition, describing non-commutative becomings. Rather than opposing a variety of functions, we could pose a wave function that superposes non-commutative variables. Rhythm is hearing-in-rhythm if we suspend frequency, as this operation is idempotent such that hearing adds nothing to rhythm, since rhythm originates in the random of indiﬀerent noise. In other words, we are at ‘fault’ if we try to trace the echo in the ﬂow of time, since ‘time’ itself can be an echo in a commutative space. Perhaps we can demonstrate the crux of the argument in showing its relation with Johannes Fabian’s idea about the fundamental contradiction between ethnographic ﬁeldwork and the anthropological knowledge in terms of how anthropology constructs its object, the ‘Other’, which in temporal terms amounts to a denial of coevalness to this ‘Other’, which is interpreted as anthropology’s allochronic discourse or its schizogenic use of time (Fabian 2014).
