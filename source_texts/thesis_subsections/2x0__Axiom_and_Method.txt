2.ON QUAKING GROUNDS

2x0. Axiom and Method

=ilim ilim bilmektir, ilim kendin bilmektir=
ilim=science, knowledge
bilmek(tir)=(is) to know
kendin=self, oneself, (by) yourself

=knowledge is to know science, knowledge is to know oneself=
=science is to know knowledge, science is to know oneself=
=knowledge is to know knowledge, science is to know oneself=
=science is to know science, knowledge is to know oneself=

The aphorism that was in the epigraph is the axiom of this study. It is attributed to the 13th century Anatolian folk poet Yunus Emre. It is an enigmatic statement, one that is impossible to accurately translate into English. Yet this impossibility is not a restrictive impossibility; it is considered here as an enabling impossibility. In a single gesture, it anticipates the whole of our discussion in the preceding phases, from the canonical formula of Levi-Strauss to Laruelle’s non-standard philosophy. Its ambiguity arises from the word ilim, which can be translated as both science and knowledge. The conjugations that this ambiguous word gives birth to is attempted to be laid down above, but the conjugations are certainly not limited to the ones we have taken note of. The axiomatization of this statement is our safeguard against the axiomatic logic of capital that erects meaning as self-resonant while destroying brute materiality; whereas our axiom is an immanent echo of folk poetry tradition in Anatolia that is conditioned by the ‘common people’ against the ornate tradition of Divan poetry, which is the language and art form of the courtly aﬀairs. The axiom that is in a diﬀerent language than the one the discussion here follows also points to an obstacle in our dealings here which is the problematic issue of translation.

Arising from this axiom, our method is an echo of a Turkish novelist and engineer, Oğuz Atay, which he describes in his famous book Tutunamayanlar, that has been translated into English as The Disconnected. Yet already after our epigraph, we have attempted to translate a part of his last unﬁnished book Eylembilim (Action-science) in which he speaks as a mathematician, who tries to see what has happened to him “as consisting of solvable functions of an unknown ‘X’“ (Atay 1998, 19), which is what he equates with ‘human’. If we have gone over various thinkers in the preceding phases, being sympathetic to Levi-Strauss’ structuralism and Laruelle’s non-standard philosophy, being critical of certain others; our axiom and our method that is being explained here makes our engagement with their concepts redundant, in the sense that the account that we are giving here need not really resonate withtheir works. Just as we have observed a non-structuralist account, we could speak of a non-Laruellian non-philosophy through Yunus Emre and Oğuz Atay, who can be considered as non-philosophers in their own right. The shift from a theory that is critical of Western prejudices, or Greco-Judaic transcendence in Laruelleian parlance, towards theories, novels, or poems that are more ‘native’, seems more appropriate for the account we are giving here.


In Tutunamayanlar, our protagonist Turgut receives the news that his friend Selim has committed suicide and left Turgut a letter; and we follow Turgut throughout the book as he delves into Selim’s writings, as well as his own memories and encounters with common acquaintances while becoming all the more disconnected as he goes deeper into this rabbit hole. The part that is particularly important for our attention here is a theory Turgut explains to Selim called the ‘The Coordinates of Life’, which is an invention of Turgut. He calls his invention an ilim-hayal, which can be translated as science(knowledge)-imagination, or more crudely as science ﬁction, and explains ‘The Coordinates of Life’ as “An introduction to the explanation of what a person does, wherever, whenever and however he is, according to the principles of analytic geometry” (Atay 2012, 68). Turgut calls his theory a ‘vile’, ‘based’ or ‘damned’ explanation, and asks himself “why are there coordinates of points, lines, curves…but not coordinates of a more perfect being, the human being, and of life, which is an inseparable part of the human“ and then he proceeds to demonstrate his ‘spiritual hunger’ for knowledge by drawing a coordinate system on a piece of paper (Atay 2012, 70). 

…If we know what a human being has done at a certain time, in a certain place and under certain conditions, the curves of the equations written on the basis of these known facts, i.e. the predetermination of the dimensions of motion and time, and whose constant coeﬃcients are determined by the designated characteristics of that human being, drawn according to the time variable, show us what that human being will do in the future and under which conditions... (Atay 2012, 72)

But after this explanation, Selim intervenes and asks Turgut about which sign system will be used for this equation of human life and with what transformation the 29
coeﬃcients of the known factors in a person would be evaluated. Turgut answers that if we turn this theory into a ‘vile’ practice, we need to ﬁnd a system that will display all human knowledge in algebraic notations to express the biological, psychological and sociological conditions of human beings with algebraic signs; so that we can substitute words with numerical values and grammatical combinations with transcendental equations (Atay 2012, 73). Following the axiom and method which is more suited to our native sensibilities here, we will be transforming the ‘ilim-hayal’ or ‘bilim-kurgu’ (science-ﬁction) of Turgut into an ‘insan-kurgu’ (anthro-ﬁction) that will also be a ‘ev-kurgu’ (eco-ﬁction). The fascination or perhaps the abuse of ancient Greek roots such as ‘anthropos’ or ‘eco’ by the English language need not be taken as given. There is a sense of objection that is considered in these transformations to translating ‘anthropology’ into Turkish as ‘antropoloji’ or ‘ecology’ as ‘ekoloji’, whereas ‘insan-bilim’ (human-science) and ‘ev-bilim’ (house-science) would sound much more powerful and much more resonant in the Turkish language.
