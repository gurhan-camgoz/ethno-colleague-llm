0x1.A Miniature Conceptual History of Earthquakes

Deborah Coen notes Nietzsche’s use of metaphor of the earthquake to talk about a concept-quake caused by science, and forms a parallel between the reception of Kurt Gödel’s incompleteness theorems by philosophers like Popper and Menger, who used the metaphor to reflect upon the Gödel’s theorems as bringing about confusion and uncertainty like the impact of an earthquake (Coen 2013, 2). In fact, Nietzsche’s concept-quake itself could be posed as a reception, or indeed as a retrospection, of the Kantian sublime which had developed through Kant’s physical geography and anthropology into his critical philosophy. Commenting on the impact of 1755 Lisbon Earthquake upon Kant’s geoimaginary, so to speak, Passannante writes that for Kant the temporality of the sublime meant that the “the most ordinary experience was full of earthquakes to come” and that the movement of the sublime was compared to a vibration resolving into cancellation, “evoking the image and language of earthquakes” (Passanante 2019, 232-233).

This meta-narrative that figures the Lisbon earthquake as the ground of modern history lays bare an antinomy which creeps within philosophy and science: “Kant founded a modern science of the earth precisely by eliminating the human subject from it” (Coen 2013, 8). The figure-ground reversal enacted by the Lisbon earthquake leads Kant to “discover” the figure-ground reversal as a model of itself, and the sublime as “the rational disposition revealed in the one who judges” (Passannante 2019, 222). However, already in the beginning of 20th century the anticipative sublime reveals a “Nietzschean master” which looms on the horizon for the European geo-imaginary in retrospection, that comes with a complementary twist on “the seismological fantasy of Immanuel Kant: the earthquake emptied of human content and reduced to a ‘fascinating physics experiment’” (Baelz 1906, 718 as quoted in Coen 2013, 134).

In the first chapter of his Hyperobjects, Timothy Morton talks about ‘A Quake in Being’ to describe his ‘discovery’ as “symptoms of a fundamental shaking of being, a being-quake” which implies that the “ground of being is shaken” (Morton 2015, 19). Offering a quasi-Heideggerian solution to the Kantian gap between the phenomenon and the thing, one that is derived from the framework of object- oriented ontology; hyperobjects appear as viscous, nonlocal, undulating, phasing and interobjective (Morton 2015, 24). There is an account of various discoveries situated in the beginning of the 20th century, namely by Husserl, by Einstein, and by Planck, each in their own respective ways discover something strange about objects, about the discreteness of experience, of spacetime, or of quanta; yet, somehow all three discoveries confirm the Kantian gap between phenomenon and thing (Morton 2015, 11-14).

Hyperobjects, in their massive scalar disruption of humans in spatial and temporal terms, are responsible for the end of the world, and not in the sense of a coming apocalypse but one that is already happening or has already happened. Morton’s consideration of the end of the world as we know it, begs for the question of for whom or as who knows it, and the answer to which sounds a lot like for philosophers: Humans are still not to be found anywhere. Similar to Kant, Morton gives an account of a disaster in which humans are missing and victims are silent. Although he asserts that the hyperobjects are “more deeply challenging” than disasters (Morton 2015, 16), they enact a forgetting in the image and language of earthquake, as being-quake which cancels seismicity into annihilation, which is indeed “a kind of philosophical amnesia” that enacts a forgetting in terms of the making and burying of the disaster (Passannante 2019, 234) or the displacement of the human and the silencing of the victim.

The symptomatology of a reflexively criminal world subjecting the victim to a double-death once as displaced from the centre and as forgotten, rendered mute and silent (Laruelle 2015, 64), necessitates in posing the criminal world as the same world that has been ending for philosophers; the solution to which does not seem like more philosophy. If earthquakes blend into the mixture that are hyperobjects, they do so as entrapped within a circularity that captures them in a mode of double- articulation. The antinomy of ecology and philosophy receives a philosophical solution in Morton’s account, whereas François Laruelle tackles this antinomy by proposing ecology as a new science that undermines the authority of philosophy. Laruelle displaces ecology as an ontological object, and perhaps also it could be said that he displaces philosophy, rather than displacing humanity, and attempts to undo the violence of philosophy by proposing ecology as a new science that rivals philosophy (Laruelle 2021).

If we had tried to trace, perhaps a miniaturized, conceptual history of earthquakes in European geo-imaginary, Laruelle’s approach could be noted down as initiating a theory-quake: a presentation that is “according to the quantum operator of the imaginary number” (Laruelle 2021, 5). He poses the theoretical displacement of philosophy by ecology as “the first phase of a massive earthquake” (Laruelle 2021, 7) that is followed by the transformation of ecological rationality based on algebra of complex numbers by creating new concepts and mutating the meaning of the others, which considered as a whole is “an eco-fiction, a new ecological science parallel to science-fiction” (Laruelle 2021, 1), and “fictional insofar as the victims are never its simple objects or subjects, but its conditions and occasions” (Laruelle 2015, 114). The theory-quake considers an algebraic earthquake as the square root of -1, or i, which is a “subtractive work operating on the representative forms of philosophy and breaking their circularity” (Laruelle 2021, 69), which makes it possible to talk in terms of a ‘downed’ or lowered-over transcendence or subtractive addition that conjugates variables.
