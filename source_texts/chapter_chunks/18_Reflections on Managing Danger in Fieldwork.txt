Reflections on Managing 
Danger in Fieldwork: 
Danger ous Anthropology 
in Belfast 
Jeffrey A. Sluka 
In many areas of the world, anthropological 
fieldwork is more dangerous today than it was 
in the past.1 There are approximately 120 
"armed conflicts" (euphemism for wars) in the 
world today (Nietschmann 1987), and given 
that about one-third of the world's countries 
are currently involved in warfare and about 
two-thirds of countries routinely resort to 
human rights abuses as normal aspects of their 
political process to control their populations, 
it is clear that few anthropologists will be able 
to avoid conflict situations and instances of 
sociopolitical violence in the course of their 
professional lives (Nordstrom and Martin 
1992:15). While it has long been recognized 
that danger is probably inherent in anthropo­
logical fieldwork, it is only recently that the 
methodological and subjective issue of danger 
has been addressed directly and systematical ly. 
In 1986, Nancy Howell first called attention 
to the need to discuss the issue of danger in 
fieldwork in an unpublished paper, "Occupa­
tional Safety and Health in Anthropology." 
She noted that the personal dangers involved in doing fieldwork had largely been ignored, 
denied, or taken for granted and argued that 
this issue should be a major concern of anthro­
pological fieldworkers. She also suggested that 
one of the professional associations should 
conduct a comprehensive survey of occupa­
tional safety and health in the discipline, and 
this idea was adopted by the American 
Anthropological Association (AAA). In 1990, 
the first publications directly dealing with 
danger in fieldwork emerged -an AAA special 
report tided Surviving Fieldwork (Howell 
1990) and an article tided ''Participant Obser­
vation in Violent Social Contexts" (Sluka 
1990). This chapter presents an updated and 
revised version of my earlier article on man­
aging danger, incorporating reflections on new 
fieldwork. I begin with a brief description of 
the research setting during my two periods 
of fieldwork in the Catholic-nationalist ghettos 
of Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 1981-2 and 
1991 and then make some general comments 
and recommendations concerning the conduct 
of ethnographic research in dangerous or

violent social contexts, deriving from these 
experiences and similar ones by other 
anthropologists. 
While special ethnographic, methodologi­
cal, theoretica l, and ethical sensit.ivities are 
required when working on, and in, dangerous 
areas, to a substantial degree the dangers faced 
by anthropologists in their fieldwork can be 
mediated through foresight, planning, and 
skillful maneuv er. While this chapter deals 
specifically with participant observation in 
countries characterized by political instability, 
conilict, and insurgency, much that is said is 
broadly applicable to generalized situations in 
which fieldworkers may be in physical danger 
from human sources (i.e., research partici­
pants, authorities, and others).2 
Setting 
In 1981-2, I conducted research in Divis Flats, 
a Catholic-nationalist ghetto on the lower Falls 
Road in Belfast. This research was based on 
participant observation and interviews with 
seventy-six families, and the monograph 
emerging from this was a study of the social 
dynamics of popular support for the Irish 
Republican Army (IRA) and Irish National 
Liberation Army (INLA) (Sluka 1989).3 After 
nearly a decade, in July 1991, I returned to the 
Catholic-nationalist ghettos of Belfast for six 
months of fieldwork on "aspects of political 
culture in Northern Ireland." These "urban 
village" ghetto communities represent the 
major battlegrounds or "killing fields" of the 
war in Northern Ireland. For over twenty­
three years, the residents of the Catholic­
nationalist ghettos have been caught between 
the urban guerrilla warfare of the IRA and 
INLA and the counterinsurgency operations of 
the Security Forces. Since the beginning of the 
war in 1969, the British authorities have 
sought to contain repression and resistance 
within the Catholic ghettos of Belfast, Derry, 
Newry, and other towns and cities and in the 
rural border areas where Catholics are the 
majority population (e.g., the so-called bandit 
country of south Armagh around Crossma­
glen) (Rolston 1991). Counterinsur gency oper­
ations and the "dirty war" apparatus (Dillon 
1990; Faligot 1983 ), coupled with the activi-ties of pro-government death squads and sec­
tarian attacks by Loyalist extremists, have 
created an unpredictable deployment of terror 
concentrated in these communities, with the 
result that every family or household can tell 
you about a relative, neighbor, or friend in jail 
or killed by the Security Forces or Loyalists. 
The Catholic ghettos are "killing fields" in the 
sense that they represent the major sites of vio­
lence, the battlegrounds where domination 
and resistance in general and the war in par­
ticular are concentrated, contained, and iso­
lated. They are spaces of violence, death, and 
transformation that continually generate both 
recruits to the Republican paramilitaries and 
enough popular support and sympathy among 
the rest of the people to maintain the current 
struggle. 
When I returned to Belfast in 1991, two 
things had occurred in the interim that directly 
affected this research. First, in 1986, a bloody 
internal feud split the INLA and led to the 
formation of a new, breakaway paramil itary 
organization calling itself the Irish Peoples Lib­
eration Organization (IPLO). Second, in 1989, 
my book on popular support for the IRA and 
INLA in Divis Flats was published. I sent a 
copy of the book to friends in Belfast, who 
subsequently lent it to a number of people 
to read, including senior Republican activ­
ists. Because of the close association of the 
INLA, and now IPLO, with Divis Flats, I had 
contacts who advised me that if I ever returned 
to Belfast and wanted to meet the "High 
Command" of the IPLO, this could be 
arranged. Because this research was based on 
sabbatical leave, I was able to pursue an 
attempt at participatory research. I wanted to 
return to Belfast before I decided exactly what 
research I would engage in, and I wanted to 
find a subject that offered to be of mutual 
advantage to me and to the local community . 
I hoped local people in Belfast might suggest 
such a research topic. 
When I arrived in Belfast I was introduced 
by friends, in a local pub, to, first, Martin 
"Rook" O'Prey, the local Belfast comma nder 
of the IPLO, and a few days later, the overall 
commander , Jimmy Brown. {I name these 
people here because they are now deceased and 
are publicly recognized as having held these 
positions in the IPLO at the time of their 

DANGEROUS ANTHROPOLOGY IN BELFAST 261 
deaths.)4 Brown told me that he had read my 
book and thought it was very good. He then 
shocked me by asking if I would be interested 
in writing a book about the IPLO. I said that 
might be possible, if we could agree on the 
precise conditions and expectations involved, 
and we arranged to meet a week later to talk 
about it. A few days before this meeting could 
take place, Rook O'Prey, who I had only just 
met, was assassinated by a Loyalist death 
squad in his home, one of the new houses built 
as part of redevelopment, at the bottom of 
Divis Tower and in plain sight of the army 
observation post on top. The meeting was 
postponed a week, and then I met with Brown 
and the new commander for Belfast. 
These IPLO leaders told me that if I was 
interested in writing a book "like the first one, 
about their organization, they would "open all 
the doors'' I needed to gather the information. 
The first thing I discussed with them was, did 
they know what an anthropologist was and 
understand what I would be doing? I said that 
as a social scientist I was committed to objec­
tivity -that is, letting the evidence lead to the 
conclusions -and the politics of truth. I was 
willing to write an ethnography of the IPLO if 
I was allowed academic independence and 
freedom to write the truth as I saw it, as a 
result of my own research. The IPLO leaders 
agreed to this. They knew what an anthropol­
ogist was and wanted me to act as one because 
they believed that an independent academic 
study would carry more authority and could 
not be easily dismissed as propaganda. They 
said they would like to see a book that pre­
sented an inside or participant's view of the 
IPLO. They admitted that they hoped the book 
would do two things for them. First, because 
the IPLO lacked effective means of publicizing 
their perspective -for example, nothing like 
the weekly paper, An Phoblacht/Republican 
News, which presents the perspective of the 
Provisional Republican movement (Sinn Fein 
and the IRA) -the book would be a chance to 
present their perspective to the world and 
describe who they were, what they were doing, 
and why they were doing it. Second, the book 
would humanize the people in the IPLO, which 
might serve as a partial antidote to the con­
certed propaganda campaign by the British 
authorities aimed at vilifying and dehumaniz-ing them as an aspect of their counterinsur­
gency or "psychological warfare" operations. 
The conditions we agreed on were that I 
would be allowed to talk to or interview any 
member I wished, and I could ask questions 
freely. The interviews would be completely 
open, and I was not required to submit a list 
of the questions or subjected to any other 
apparent monitoring or control practice. Dur­
ing the course of the research, I was never 
refused an answer to any question. (As with 
my previous research, I voluntarily chose not 
to ask about some things such as weapons, 
finance, and planned military operations, 
which I felt were unnecessary and potentially 
dangerous both to me and to other research 
participants.) I was free to do my anthropo­
logical "thing," with only two conditions. I 
promised that I would allow the IPLO to 
review the manuscript of the book before it 
was published. They would not have editorial 
control, but I agreed to two things. First, I 
would alter anything in the manuscript neces­
sary to ensure the immediate security of any 
living member of the IPLO, for example, to 
protect anonymity of the research participants. 
Second, if there was anything else in the man­
uscript that we disagreed on, I would give 
them a right of response. That is, while I would 
not modify or delete my own independent con­
clusions and interpretations, I would include 
IPLO statements expressing their disagreement 
with my views wherever they felt it necessary. 
I thought this was fair, since it would leave 
readers of the book to judge for themselves 
whose view they gave more credence to. This 
struck me as an equitable and recipro­
cal research "bargain," in which both the 
researcher and participants stood to benefit, 
and believed that it did not compromise my 
professional ethics. It also represented, to the 
best of my knowledge, the most direct, open, 
and unimpeded access any researcher has yet 
been granted to a paramilitary organizarion 
in Northern Ireland. I decided to accept the 
IPLO's offer and approach the research as an 
experiment in liberation anthropology. 
Over the next six months I researched and 
did fieldwork with the IPLO. This was based 
on interviews, library and archival 
and participant observation -as 
thought this was practicable research, 
far as I 
m the 

262 JEFFREY A. SLUKA 
circumstances. I conducted formal interviews 
with fifteen members of the IPLO, selected to 
provide a representative cross-sample; I 
conducted interviews in Catholic-nationalist 
ghettos in Belfast, Derry, Newry, and Dublin, 
with men and women of all ranks and includ­
ing both founding and new members. I spent 
considerable time "hanging out," traveling 
with, and talking informally with about two 
dozen other IPLO members and attended a 
number of IPLO-related social and political 
functions, such as the funeral and other events 
surrounding the death of Rook O'Prey. 
With regard to the dangers inherent in such 
fieldwork, I handled or "managed" these much 
as I had during my first period of research in 
Belfast (see Sluka 1990). But this new research 
involved much more direct and intense inter­
action with guerrilla fighters than I had had in 
1981-2, and it presented new problems and 
dangers. Because members of the IPLO are 
actively involved in a war, their lives are dan­
gerous, and it is dangerous simply being with 
them. As with the IRA and INLA in my pre­
vious research, I never felt that I was in any 
danger from the IPLO. As before, my major 
concern was the authorities -particularly the 
army and police-and Loyalist paramilita ries, 
both of whom I believed represented more of 
a threat now than before because now I was 
directly researching a guerriiJa organization. In 
particular , the fieldwork period was marked by 
a major increase in Loyalist violence, from 
which academics were not immune. In Sep­
tember 1991, Adrian Guelke, a lecturer in pol­
itics at the Queen's University of Belfast, was 
shot by a Loyalist death squad from the Ulster 
Freedom Fighters (UFF, generally acknowl­
edged as a nom de guerre or front for the 
Ulster Defence Association). In the early hours 
of the morning, two or three masked gunmen 
entered his house and he was shot in the back 
at close range with a pistol as he lay sleeping 
with his wife. His life was saved when the 
automatic pistol used in the attack jammed. 
Guelke is a South African-born opponent of 
apartheid who has lived in Northern Ireland 
since 1974. A distinguished academic, he had 
no connections with any paramilitary or polit­
ical groups and was working on a book com­
paring political violence in South Africa, Israel, and Northern Ireland. The motives for the 
attack are not clear, and the Security Forces 
claim it was a case of mistaken identity, but 
Guelke believes that South African elements, 
who have links with the Loyalist paramili­
taries, may have set him up.5 
I tried to ameliorate these dangers in two 
ways. First, I tried to camouflage my research 
with the IPLO as best I could so that only they 
and a couple of close and trusted friends knew 
that I was doing it. I did research on two other 
projects at the same time (one on Republican 
martyrs and the other on the cultures of terror 
and resistance in Northern Ireland), and when 
asked about my research, I talked about these 
instead. Second, I tried to control and limit my 
contact with IPLO members. They were not 
the only people I spent my time with. In fact, 
most of my time was not spent with IPLO 
members, particularly in the first few months 
of the fieldwork, when I worked on other pro­
jects and did library and archival research on 
the history of the IPLO. Restricting interaction 
with research participants is not ideal in par­
ticipant observation, but I believed it necessary 
for security reasons. As the research pro­
gressed, I spent increasingly more time with 
IPLO members, and the most intense period 
of interviewing and participant observation 
occurred during the last two months. 
In the end, during the course of this field­
work, I was not directly threatened in any way. 
While I was stopped by Security Forces patrols 
for identity checks twice while in the company 
of IPLO leaders, I was not approached by the 
army or police, and they never indicated to me 
that they were aware that I was conducting 
research with the IPLO, When asked by sol­
diers and police about my research, I told them 
I was studying political culture and did not 
mention the lPLO. On one occasion I crossed 
the border iilegally with Jimmy Brown on a 
trip to Dublin. When I told him I was driving 
to Dublin with Jimmy, a trusted friend warned 
me that under no circumstances should I use 
the back roads to avoid the border check­
points. He warned that if I ran into a Security 
Forces patrol or SAS unit (the elite commando 
forces of the British army) on a deserted back 
road while alone in a car with the commander 
of the IPLO, I was likely to be shot dead. When 

DANGEROUS ANTHROPOLOGY IN BELFAST 263 
Jimmy and I reached the border, I followed his 
directions and we used back roads to cross 
and avoid the checkpoint. I did so because I 
believed that he was in the best position to 
decide on the route we should take. I only did 
this once, and I probably would not do it 
a gam. 
On one occasion I was participant observer 
during an IPLO operation, a propaganda exer­
cise. This was a photo-shoot for publicity pur­
poses, and an IPLO photographer was present. 
I was invit ed along because they figured I could 
take some photos of my own for the book. Six 
armed IPLO members in military uniform and 
wearing masks, dark glasses, and IPLO arm­
bands emerged in Poleglass (a Catholic­
nationalist ghetto on the outskirts of West 
Belfast) to set up a vehicle checkpoint. They 
stopped about half a dozen cars and then dis­
appeart!d. The operation lasted only a few 
minutes but was probably the most dangerous 
thing I have ever done as an anthropologist. 
Armed guerrillas are usually shot on sight in 
Northern Ireland. For the IPLO to emerge in 
public in this way is to enter a combat situation. 
Because of the constant surveillance and 
patrolling of these districts by the Security 
Forces, such operations have to be planned very 
carefully , and there is always a distinct danger 
of encountering an army patrol or undercover 
unit or being observed by the surveillance heli­
copters constantly hovering overhead. 
Another new problem I faced resulted from 
the fact that I taped the fifteen formal inter­
views. In my previous research I had not taped 
interviews, so the necessity of protecting tapes 
was a new experience. I tried to protect these 
in two ways. First, I tried to ensure there was 
nothing on them that would directly identify 
any individual, particularly the interviewee. 
Second, I hjd them away from the house where 
I lived, so there was never more than one there 
at a time. Of course, these were not foolproof 
protections. I felt justified in making the tapes 
because I had formal agreements with the 
IPLO as an organization and the individuals 
interviewed that I would try to use lPLO 
members' own words to present their views in 
the book. Because they were willing to accept 
the risk, and I believed I could protect the tapes 
and minimize that risk, I taped the interviews. Reflections and 
Recommendations 
What then are my recommendations to 
anthropologists considering fieldwork in dan­
gerous or violent social contexts? Before you 
go to the field, try to evaluate as realistically 
as possible the degree of danger, and try to 
identify potential sources of danger. Decide if 
you are prepared to accept the risks involved, 
and if you are, consider both what sorts of 
actions you might take to ameliorate or 
manage them and what sorts of actions might 
exacerbate them. Give some thought to what 
an "acceptable level" of danger might be. I 
assume that most researchers are not prepared 
to give their lives for their research and would 
retreat to safer ground if a direct threat to life 
or limb arose. Recognize as well that you may 
have to terminate your research on your own 
initiative, or that the authorities or other 
"powers that be" may compel you to do so. 
Always have a plan of escape, a means of extri­
cating yourself from the situation as quickly as 
possible, should the need arise. 
Discuss the potential dangers with advisers 
and colleagues, and seek out people with direct 
experience in the area where you intend to do 
your research. If at all possible, try to go to the 
proposed field location for an exploratory visit 
before you commit yourself to doing research 
there. I was able to visit Belfast for two weeks 
during the summer prior to my arrival there 
for fieldwork. 
Investigate your sources of funding. For 
example, Myron Glazer (1972:137), a sociol­
ogist who studied student politics in Chile, 
learned only after his return from the field that 
his funding came from a US Army-sponsored 
research group. Today, governments, mili­
taries, and intelligence agencies are funding 
research both directly and indirectly through 
front organizations (e.g., right-wing think 
tanks). Ethical considerations aside, it can be 
dangerous to accept funding from agencies 
that one's research participants consider objec­
tionable. Certainly , the danger of being defined 
as a spy is greatly exaggerated if one is funded 
by the military or the CIA. Know the origins 
of your funding, consider how people in your 

264 JEFFREY A. SLUKA 
research area might view those origins, and be 
open with them about it. 
Given that the people among whom anthro­
pologists do their research have usually never 
had an anthropologist working in their midst, 
it should be kept in mind that they are natu­
rally going to try to figure out what you are 
doing there. Usually, at least at first, they will 
define the anthropologist with reference to pre­
existing categories derived from experience 
with other strangers who have appeared in the 
community. Spy, journalist, policeman, tax 
collector, and missionary are common cate­
gories often mistakenly applied to anthropol­
ogists in the field. It is essential that researchers 
in the field make a substant ial effort to coun­
ter these public definitions of themselves, a 
process entailing a conscious effort at impres­
sion management (Berreman 1962; GoHman 
1959). It can be done by recognizing how 
people are likely to define you, avoiding acting 
in ways that might reinforce these suspicions, 
and being as honest and straightforward as 
possible about who you really are and what 
you are really doing. 
Because the most common suspicion that 
research participants have about anthropolo­
gists is that they are spies, and it is difficult to 
find an anthropologist who has done fieldwork 
who has not encountered this suspicion, this 
danger deserves special mention. Being defined 
as a spy is inherently dangerous, and the 
link between anthropology and war-related 
research has exacerbated this danger (see Sluka 
1990). Anthropologists have been involved in 
war-related, particularly counterins urgency, 
research, others have had their research used 
or "applied" by governments, militaries, and 
intelligence agencies to help plan military 
operations, and spies or intelligence agents of 
various sons have used the cover that they 
were anthropologists. As a result, people in 
many parts of the world have come increas­
ingly to believe that anthropologists, even 
those engaged in "innocent" (or in Boas's 
[1973] terms "honest") research, are actu­
ally or potentially dangerous to them. Many 
nations and peoples are therefore justifiably 
suspicious of anthropologists and will not 
alJow them to do research, and fieldwork has 
become more dangerous today than it was in 
the past. If you do not want to be defined as a spy, 
then do not be one or act like one. (See Glazer 
1970 for a good account of dealing with 
research participants' suspicions that the 
researcher is a spy.) At first, I avoided asking 
questions about sensitive political topics. In 
a similar manner, anthropologists seeking 
to counter suspicions that they are mission­
aries would at first avoid asking questions 
about religion. The sociologist Ned Polsky 
(1967:126-7) suggests that a good rule of 
fieldwork in sensitive contexts is to "initially, 
keep your eyes and ears open but keep your 
mouth shut. At first try to ask no questions 
whatsoe ver. Before you can ask questions ... 
you should get the 'feel' of their world by 
extensive and attentive listening." 
When you consider how your research par­
ticipants are likely to define you, consider ways 
of not only countering these definitions but of 
also promoting one that will enhance your 
safety and your research. It is not enough to 
not be a threat to your research participants; 
act in such a way as to be seen not to be a 
threat. In my case, my association with the 
priest and the former IRA man was fortunate 
in this respect because once they accepted my 
explanations of what I was doing in Belfast, 
others found it easier to do so as well. Polsky 
(ibid., 129) refers to this cumulative effect as 
"snowballing"; .. get an introduction to one 
[informant] who will vouch for you with 
others, who in turn will vouch for you with 
still others." He suggests that it is best to start 
at the top, with the most prestigious person in 
the group you are studying. He also suggests 
that answering research participants' questions 
frankly will help in this regard (ibid., 131 ). I 
suggest that it is important to give people as 
honest and complete a description of what you 
are doing as you can, particularly when they 
specifica lly ask for such an explanation. 
However, people will develop their own 
explanations of what researchers are doing, 
and these are often much-simplified versions 
of the explanations given by the researchers 
themselves. It is very common for research 
participants to reduce the sometimes quite 
involved explanations given by researchers 
simply to the explanation that they are 
"writing a book" about the community or 
some aspect of it. For example, this was both 

DANGE-ROUS ANTHROPOLOGY IN BELFAST 265 
William Foote Whyte's (1943:300) and my 
own experience. It is important to bear in mind 
that people may reduce your best and most 
complete explanations to much simpler, less 
accurate, and perhaps inaccurate ones. It can 
also be dangerous to give simplified explana­
tions of what you are doing. For example, if 
you simply tell people that you are writing a 
book about them, when they learn specific 
details of what you are writing about, they 
may believe that you have misled them. They 
will naturally wonder why you would want to 
do so and wonder if you have some ulterior 
motive. Be honest and give as complete and 
accurate a description of what you are doing 
as you can, but recognize that people are going 
to interpret and possibly misinterpret this. 
Continuously monitor their definitions of you, 
as these may change over time, and view your 
efforts 1 at impression management as an 
ongomg process. 
That you should approach this as a con­
scious effort at impression management is not 
. to suggest that this should be some sort 
of cold-blooded Machiavellian manipulative 
strategy. Like Polsky, I argue that it is impor­
tant to be honest with people. This is impera­
tive both ethically and with reference to 
managing danger. Being dishonest is more dan­
gerous than being honest, because it creates the 
possibility of being caught out in a lie. By 
extension, acting ethically is also safer than 
acting unethical ly.6 Be as honest and ethical as 
possible, bearing in mind that it is your 
research participants' definition of these things 
that you should seek to conform to rather than 
your own. Of course, this may raise other 
dangers, for example, when the definitions of 
what is ethical differ between the group 
studied and other groups in society, particu­
larly between the group studied and the 
authorities. 
Being honest is relatively simple as long as 
you have nothing to hide. This was not a 
problem during my first period of fieldwork, 
but it became one during the second period 
because I needed to camouflage my research 
with the IPLO. I told the authorities vaguely 
that I was studying aspects of political culture; 
the IPLO and a few trusted friends knew I was 
working with the IPLO; and I told everyone 
else I was doing research on Republican martyrs and the cultures of terror and resis­
tance. In most fieldwork situations today, 
marked as tbey are by conflict, it will proba­
bly prove to be impossible to be completely 
truthful with everyone. Nonetheless, it is a 
good danger management strategy to be as 
truthful as possible. 
Along with honesty, flexibility can be impor­
tant in danger management. Consider how far 
you are prepared to modify your interests, 
methods, and goals to adapt to dangerous con­
tingencies that may arise. Doing research in a 
dangerous environment may produce situa­
tions in which researchers must consider mod­
ifying or perhaps even compromising their 
work. These are difficult decisions to make, 
and they may be fateful both for the research 
and for the research er. Polsky discusses flexi­
bility, summing it up in the comment that "a 
final rule is to have few unbreakable rules." He 
points out that you should revise your plans 
"according to the requirements of any par­
ticular situation" and recognize that you 
will probably encounter "unanticipated and 
ambiguous situations for which one has no 
clear behavioral plan at all" (1967:133). 
While in the field, take precautions to secure 
your field notes and recordings. To do so is, of 
course, required to protect your research par­
ticipants, but it may also be necessary to 
protect yourself. This issue is discussed by 
jenkins (1984), who suggests that one should 
be selective in information gathering. He 
points out that some information should not 
be used at all and recommends that informa­
tion of this sort should not be recorded. Some 
information is best kept only in one's head. 
When sensitive information is recorded, it is 
imperative to protect research participants' 
anonymit y. jenkins (ibid., 156) suggests that 
one carry around only the current day's notes, 
and it is probably advisable in some cases that 
you never have more than a few weeks' notes 
in your possession at any time while in the 
field. Your notes can be kept under lock and 
key, and arrangements can be made to period­
ically remove them from the field (perhaps by 
mailing them off or by depositing them in a

Consider the possibility that some dangers 
may not end once you return from the field. 
There may be those at home who object to 

266 JEFFREY A. SLUKA 
your research, and they may threaten you as 
well. (For example, I have been threatened by 
Loyalists since I left Belfast.) Also, consider the 
possibility that ethical and other considera­
tions may mean that you will not be able to 
publish your findings. 
If you intend to do research on political 
topics, particularly if you intend to do "parti­
san anthropology" or panicipate in political 
activities, it goes without saying that the 
dangers are correspondingly greater. 7 In refer­
ence to "partisan anthropol ogy," the Asso­
ciation of Social Anthropologists' book on 
ethnographic research notes that "siding with 
a guerrilla movement ... can be dangerous to 
oneself as well as to one's objectivity" (Ellen 
1984:80). It is interesting to note that the usual 
concern is not that such involvement may be 
dangerous but rather that it may not be 
"objective." It should be kept in mind that one 
does not actually have to be a member or sup-. 
porter of a political organization to be at risk 
from their enemies. Association, even if purely 
"objective," can be dangerous in itself . In some 
cases the status of an outsider or "objective sci­
entific observer" provides a degree of protec­
tion, but do not count on it. And if you are 
actually a participant, your status as a social 
scientist will probably offer you no protection 
at all. 
One might think that neutrality is a good 
danger management strategy, but this is not 
always the case. For example, June Nash, in 
what is perhaps the best account by an anthro­
pologist of managing dangers encountered 
while conducting fieldwork in a politically sen-
. . . 
smve envtronment, notes, 
In Bolivia it was not possible to choose the 
role of an impartial observer and still work in 
the tin mining community of Oruro, where I 
had gone to study ideology and social change. 
... The polarisation of the class struggle made 
it necessary to take sides or to be cast by them 
on one side or the other. In a revolutionar y sit­
uation, no neutrals are allowed. (1976: 150) 
By contrast, Frances Henry discusses research 
in a situation of conflict between the govern­
ment and trade uruons in Trinidad. She notes, 
Commitment to the unions ... could conceiv­
ably have led to loss of freedom, detention, or, 
at the very least, deportation .... On the other hand, commitment to the government could 
have resulted in loss of rapport with union 
officials. Identification with either faction can 
lead to serious personal difficulties and it 
obviously limits one's research freedom. 
(1966:553) 
Henry was able to establish rapport with both 
sides and discusses how she got around 
attempts to get her to abandon her neutralit y. 
Basically , she did so by expressing "sympathy 
or agreement with persons on both sides" 
(ibid.). In face-to-face interactions with her 
research participants, she expressed sympathy 
with them, even though they had conflicting 
points of view. While Henry maintains that in 
fact she was "neutral," this was not the image 
she presented to her research participa nts. 
Rather, she misled her informants by present­
ing an image of being on their side when she 
knew that she was not. Besides the ethical ques­
tions this raises, Henry admits that this was 
dangerous, and I would not recommend it. 
In some cases, professing neutralit y may be 
a good danger management strategy; in others, 
it may not be. In some cases, you may want to 
tell some people that you are neutral and 
others that you are not. It may sound like a 
case of "situational ethics," but I had no 
qualms about telling British soldiers on the 
streets of Belfast who inquired as to my per­
sonal politics that I was a "neutral social sci­
entist" while at the same time letting my 
research participants in the ghettos know that 
I sympathized with their situation. 
When conducting research based on partici­
pant observation in communities involved 
in political conflicts, it is generally the case 
that, as Nash, myself, and many others have 
found, "no neutrals are allowed." As Glazer 
( 1970:314) notes, "In times of heightened 
group antagonism there is little room for neu­
trality." This does not necessa rily mean that 
you have to become a panisan. In my case, it 
was sufficient to communic ate in various ways 
to people where my "sympathies" lay; that is, 
with them. Whether or not you take sides, 
those actively involved in the situation are 
going to define whose side they think you are 
on. They will act toward you on the basis of 
this definition, regardless of your profession s 
of neutral ity. 

DANGEROUS ANTHROPOLOGY IN BELFAST 267 
Gerrit Huizer (1973), a social psychol­
ogist who has done fieldwork in several Latin 
American countries, including El Salvador and 
Chile, provides illumination here. When he 
worked in a village in El Salvador, government 
officials often warned him of the "dangers" of 
living among the peasants. Despite these 
warnings, he chose not to carry a pistol like 
government officials did. Instead, he "relied 
mostly on the common human sympathy" he 
felt for the villagers. Basically , Huizer's 
approach to handling danger is to gain 
people's confidence by convincing them that 
you are "on their side." This is done by 
sincerely identifying with their interests, 
understa nding and sympathizing with their 
problems and grievances, and showing them 
that you are willing to act accordingly (ibid., 
21, 28). I think that this is quite the most 
common approach taken by anthropologists 
today, and it can be very effective as a danger­
ameliorating approach to fieldwork. 
When working in a community in which 
. guerrilla organizations are present, you must 
learn to walk softly. Be sensitive to what sorts 
of questions may be asked and what sorts are 
taboo. For example, I found that it was all 
right to ask people what they thought of the 
IRA and INLA, if they did or did not support 
them and why, about the role the guerrillas 
played in the communit y, and about criticisms 
they had concerning them. But I did not ask 
questions about things like arms and explo­
sives, or about who might be a guerrilla or 
actively involved with them. If you want to 
make direct contact with guerrillas, it is best 
to make it known that you are interested in 
this and then wait until they come (or do not 
come) to you. If you do make contact (whi�;h 
is illegal in most cases), you must be flexible 
and honest with them. 
In situations in which insurgencies are going 
on, fieldworkers may have to deal with both 
the insurgents and the authorities combating 
them at the same time and this can be a very 
difficult task. Often, if you become associated 
with one, this alienates you from the other. In 
many field situations the authorities represent 
a significant source of danger. This warning 
is particularly true if you are studying or 
involved with political organizations. For 
example, Arnold Ap, an anthropologist in West Papua, was tortured and killed by the 
Indonesian army in 1984, as a result of his 
association with the Free Papua Movement 
(OPM). The army claimed that he was "a 
known OPM helper" (Osborne 1985:xiv). 
And in 1980, Miriam Daly, a lecturer at the 
Queen's University of Belfast, was assassi­
nated, probably by intelligence agents, as a 
result of her involvement with the Irish Repub­
lican Socialist party (Faligot 1983:98). 
Just as I found in my research, Polsky found 
that most of the risk in his fieldwork came 
from the authorities rather than from his 
research participants. He notes that "most of 
the danger for the fieldworker comes not from 
the cannibals and head-hunters but from the 
colonial officials" (1967:145). In his particu­
lar case, he found that most of the risk came 
from the police rather than from the "career 
criminals" that were his research participants. 
The criminologist studying uncaught crimi­
nals in the open finds sooner or later that law 
enforcers try to put him on the spot -because, 
unless he is a complete fool, he uncovers infor­
mation that law enforcers would like to know, 
and, even if he is very skillful, he cannot 
always keep law enforcers from suspecting 
that he has such information. (Ibid.) 
The dangers emanating from the authorities 
include the risks of intimidation, physical 
assaults, arrest, interrogation, torture, prose­
cution, imprisonment, and even execution or 
assassination. Other dangers include being 
defined as a guerrilla "sympathizer" or being 
accused of "giving aid and comfort to the 
enemy," as a result of which the authorities 
may revoke their permission for the research. 
These dangers should be recognized, and 
efforts should be made to reduce them. (See 
Carey 1972 for a good discussion of the legal 
risks faced by researchers in situations in 
which illegal activities occur.) 
An associated phenomenon that can also 
generate danger is the fact that "people tend 
to associate the research that a researcher 
is conducting with the researcher himself" 
(Henslin 1972:55). As Henslin points out, if 
you do research on drug users or homosexu­
ality, you may fall under suspicion of being a 
drug user or homosexual yourself. If you do 
research on a political movement, some, 

268 JEFFREY A. SLUKA 
particularly those opposed to that movement, 
may believe that you are a partisan. The more 
political or controversial a subject one 
researches, the more likely one is to be sus­
pected of bias or partisansh ip. 
While you are in the field, do not grow com­
placent about the dangers you face, and do not 
treat the situation as a game or adventure. Do 
not ignore potential threats when they arise: 
they rarely just "go away" if you ignore them. 
For example, dangerous rumors may emerge 
at almost any time while in the field. Whether 
these rumors are true or false, they should be 
dealt with. If they are false, they should be 
publicly denied rather than ignored. If there is 
some truth to the rumors, work to convince 
people that you are not a threat, and if you are 
a direct threat, get out. James T. Carey 
( 1972:86-7) discusses "handling damaging 
rumors" in fieldwork and makes some useful 
suggestions. Try to anticipate the circum­
stances under which dangerous or damaging ­
rumors are likely to arise, and then limit your 
actual observations of activities and situations 
(e.g., illegal ones) that might lead to these cir­
cumstances. If and when such rumors do arise, 
try to get people who have vouched for you in 
the past to do so again. 
Make a continuing effort to define and rede­
fine risks and dangers in light of actual expe­
riences, and work to reduce such dangers by 
improving old methods and developing new 
ones as your network of contacts and degree 
of experience expand over time. Managing the 
dangers inherent in fieldwork in a context like 
that of Belfast is not something that can be 
gotten out of the way in the first few weeks in 
the field and then dismissed as taken care of. 
On the last day of my first period of research 
in Belfast, I was returning home to pack and 
found the street cordoned off by the army. 
They would not allow me to go down the 
street to my house because of the presence of 
a "'suspect device." I argued with a sergeant 
about it, and he finally said in disgust that I 
could go to the house if I was prepared to take 
responsibility for the risk. It turned out that 
local children had taped some wire to a can of 
paint and rolled it under an army Land Rover 
as a prank. 
With time, you may be able to successfully 
allay suspicions and reduce some of the dangers, but new ones will continue to arise. 
One need not be paranoid about the dangers 
involved in doing research in violent social 
contexts, but a good dose of realistic appreci­
ation goes a long way. And, all in all, it is no 
doubt better to be a bit paranoid about such 
things than it is to be a bit complacent about 
them. 
Finally, remember that while most dangers 
can be mediated at least to some degree by 
skillful maneuver, some dangers may be 
beyond management. For example, despite 
your best efforts at danger management, 
simple bad luck can sometimes result in the 
termination of the research, or worse yet the 
termination of the researcher . Researchers 
working in dangerous environm ents should, 
like professional gamblers, recognize that their 
enterprise is inherently a combination of both 
skill and luck (Ellen 1984:97). Good luck can 
sometimes help overcome a lack of skill, and 
well-developed skills can go far to help over­
come the effects of bad luck. But sometimes no 
amount of skill will save one from a gross 
portion of bad luck. What distinguishes the 
professional from the amateur, in both gam­
bling and anthropol ogy, is the concerted effort 
always to maximize skillful handling of the sit­
uation, while recognizing that skill alone is no 
guarantee of success. Danger is not a purely 
"technica l" problem and is never totally 
manageable. 
It might seem that most of these recommen­
dations amount to little more than common 
sense. They are by no means exhaustive, but I 
hope that they are thought provoking or "con­
sciousness raising" and indicative of some of 
the problems involved in managing danger. 
They are intended to be a starting point from 
which those considering research in dangerous 
contexts can map out their own strategies 
for conducting fieldwork safely. It should go 
without saying that counting on people to rely 
on common sense is a wholly inade quate 
approach to almost anything. Certainly , it is 
not adequate for advisers to tell their students 
that they should use "common sense" while 
they are in the field, and leave it at that. The 
example of the anthropologist shot in Belfast 
is a case in point. Some might say that his 
mistake was simply that he did not use 
common sense. My point has been that such 

DANGEROUS ANTHROPOLOGY IN BELFAST 269 
an analysis of these cases is an inadequate 
response. 
Conclusion 
These observations were made in reference to 
my experience in Northern Ireland, where a 
guerrilla war has been going on now for more 
than twenty-three years. As I said at the begin­
ning, there are about 120 armed conflicts in 
the world today. There is an urgent need for 
research in aU of the places where these con­
flicts are occurring, and many other violent or 
dangerous locations as well. 
Fieldwork is possible even in the most dan­
gerous contexts. Anthropologists should not 
select themselves out of research in such con­
texts on the basis of stereotypes, media images, 
or inadequate information concerning the 
dangers involved. And they should not select themselves out of such research because train­
ing in managing such dangers is not provided 
in anthropolo gy. Many more anthropologists 
could and should do fieldwork in these areas. 
The dangers are often exaggerated, and in 
most cases they are not insurmountable. 
The world is not becoming a safer place for 
the pursuit of anthropological fieldwork, but, 
perhaps for that very reason, there is more 
need now for such research than there has ever 
been before. We can meet this challenge, but 
we should do so rationally by considering the 
dangers as methodological issues in their own 
right. The intention of this chapter has been 
to further our consideration of danger as a 
methodological issue and contribute to devel­
oping ways of minimizing risks and protecting 
anthropologists while they are in the field. It is 
not an exaggeration to say that this is, in fact, 
a matter of life and death.

The relational nature of fieldwork addressed in Part III, the conflicts described in 
Part IV, and the changing relation between anthropolo gists and their research par­
ticipants referred to in Part V have made contemporary fieldwork morally and eth­
ically more complex. A grasp of the ethical implications of fieldwork is indispensable 
before students can develop their first research design. Part VI of this reader deals 
with ethics in fieldwork. In making the selections for this part, many difficult choices 
had to be made. We could have simply chosen exemplary case studies from the 
growing literature on ethical dilemmas faced by anthropologists in the field (e.g., 
Rynkiewich and Spradley 1976, Appell1978, Ellen 1984, Cassell and Jacobs 1987, 
Fluehr-Lobban 2003b, Caplan 2003, Meskell and Pels 2005), or included some­
thing on the Tierney/Chagnon "Darkness in El Dorado" debate, which has been 
described as the greatest ethical debacle in the history of the discipline (see Tierney 
2000, Borofsky 2005). In the end, we have chosen to focus more generally on how 
the concern with ethics emerged and has evolved in the discipline -that is, on the 
context of ethical thinking rather than particular case studies. Thus, we have chosen 
articles by Irving Horowitz, Philippe Bourgois, and Gerald Berreman, which provide 
the general history, context, and critique of the evolution of ethical codes in anthro­
pology, Pollock's case study of providing amateur medical care, which has been one 
of the classic or "traditional'' ethical dilemmas in anthropological fieldwork, and

272 PART VI: FIELDWORK ETHICS 
finally we have included a copy of the Code of Ethics of the American Anthropo­
logical Association (AAA) as it has evolved today (American Anthropological Asso­
ciation, 1998; for the British code of ethics see Association of Social Anthropol ogists 
1999). 
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, anthropologists first began seriously discussing 
the ethical dilemmas faced by fieldworkers studying and living in a world rife with 
political turmoil, and the first code of ethics in anthropology emerged as a direct 
result of the protest against counterinsurgency research for the US government in 
Latin America and Southeast Asia. Leading anthropologists denounced the collab­
oration of anthropology with the counterinsur gency agencies of the US government 
-specifically Project Camelot in Latin America, Project Agile in Thailand, and the 
Himalayan Border Countries Project in India. In particular , the issues raised by 
Project Camelot and the publication of the Thailand counterins urgency research 
(Wolf and Jorgensen 1970) launched the debate on ethics in anthropolog y, revealed 
the pressing need to set ethical standards within the profession, and led to the devel­
opment and adoption of the American Anthropological Association's "Principles of 
Professional Responsibility" (PPR) in 1971 (Fluehr-Lobban 2003a). 
In the 1990s, there was renewed vigor in discussion and debate about ethics in 
anthropolog y, which led to the adoption · of a new -critics such as Gerald Berreman 
would say eviscerated -code of ethics· by the American Anthropological Association 
in 1998. The impetus for this change was a general trend in the discipline toward 
"professionalism" and the changing employment market for anthropologists, with 
an increasing number employed outside of academia in the private sector. Peter Pels 
( 1999) has identified professionalization as a dominant trend in contemp orary 
anthropol ogy. He argues that the purpose of professional ethics codes is to guaran­
tee the technical and moral quality of service rendered to clients and help discipline 
members of the profession who fail to maintain what in corporate-speak would be 
termed "quality control." Professionalism seems to mean redefining anthropolo gy 
as a form of employment like any other -simply a marketable research skill or com­
modjty for sale in the marketplace. Thus, professionalization and corporatization 
are the same thing, and the new AAA code of ethics reflects these developments. This 
is a significant change, because the primary purpose of the original ethics code was 
first and foremost the protection of research participants from harm. The shift 
toward professionalism subverts this, with the result that harm or negative conse­
quences to research participants are ameliorated by "competing" ethical obligations 
and responsibilities to employers and authorities, now referred to in corporate-speak 
as "clients" or "shareholders," whose interests are treated as equal to those of the 
people researched. 
Pels ( 1999) observes that, in defining their professional interests and duties , 
anthropologists are now wavering between responsi bility to the people researched, 
on the one hand, and service to those who fund research and the authorities under 
whose jurisdiction those researched live, on the other. We now appear to be con­
fused about who our "clients" are -those studied, ourselves, funders and sponsors , 
the public? And, if all four, do we have equal ethical obligations to them all? In the 
PPR, there was a hierarchical principle that helped to sort out this conflict -the 
interests of the research participants were treated as primary, since their coopera­
tion can be obtained only on the basis of trust. 

INTRODUGION 273 
As noted, the first major debate about ethics in anthropo logy, which eventually 
led to the adoption of the first code of ethics in the discipline, was sparked by the 
controversy generated about government-sponsored social science research for mil­
itary and political purposes, which occurred as a result of Project Camelot. Camelot 
was a major research project in 1964 into the causes of insurgency and potential 
revolution in Latin America, sponsored by the US Departments of Defense and State, 
which was terminated in its early stages as a result of the controversy it generated. 
In "The Life and Death of Project Camelot" (1973 ), Horowitz, who also edited a 
definitive volume on the controversy (1974), describes Project Camelot and recounts 
the history of the academic reactions to it which eventually led to its cancellation. 
Horowitz argues that the central issue is the dangers inherent in government­
sponsored "mission-oriented" research motivated by political and military interests, 
especially when they are carried out in other nations, and that at the heart of the 
problem of Project Camelot is the question "What are and are not the legitimate 
functions of a scientist ?" (1973:147). 
The theme of Philippe Bourgois' s article "Confronting the Ethics of Anthropol­
ogy" is "the politics of ethics," and he presents a powerful critique of anthropo­
logical .research ethics as embodied in the AAA code, based on his fieldwork 
experience in Central America. He begins by observing that "The ethics of anthro­
pological research are too complicated and important to be reduced to unambigu­
ous absolutes or even perhaps to be clearly defined ... The eminently political 
orientation of a supposed apolitical commitment to empirical research must be 
·appreciated for its internal inconsistencies and ultimate ethical poverty" (1991:110). 
In 1981, while in El Salvador exploring potential research sites, Bourgois was caught 
up with local villagers fleeing from a government counterinsur gency "search and 
destroy" operation that became a peasant massacre. He fled with them, and "for 
the next fourteen days, we stayed together running at night and hiding during 
the day" (1991:118). These military operations were supported by the Reagan 
administration' s foreign policy, and when he returned to the United States he 
sought out the media and human rights lobbyists on Capitol Hill to present his 
testimony to the public. But most significant ly, he published a report critical of 
US policy, titled "Running for My Life in El Salvador ," in the Washington Post 
(February 14, 1982). 
The academic reaction was severe criticism of his actions as unethical, and this 
nearly ended his anthropological career. In a telling footnote, he recounts that "A 
church-based director of a human rights organization rebuked me when I explained 
to him the anthropological ethics which prevented me from showing members of 
US Congress photographs of peasant victims during my testimony on the military 
invasion : 'For God's sake; what are you talking about! Testify as a human being 
then-not as an anthropologist' " (1991:123). 
Bourgois argues that the problem with contemporary anthropological ethics is 
that the boundaries of what is defined as ethical are too narrowly drawn and that 
ethics can be subject to rigid, righteous interpretations which place them at logger­
heads with overarching human rights concerns. He asks: What are the limits of 
informed consent in research involving highly unequal power relations? Is the 
consent of the powerful required to do research with the powerless, or on the effects 
of powerlessness? Do we need the consent of repressive authorities in order to do 

274 PART VI: FIELDWORK ETHICS 
research with those who are oppressed by them? How does one fulfill the obliga­
tion to obtain informed consent from the powerful, and respect their privacy 
and interests? He argues that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to satisfy the 
discipline-bound code of ethics if one does research on political topics such as mar­
ginalization and oppression, and that these unresolved questions reveal "that there 
is nothing apolitical about the North American commitment to relativism and to 
its methodologically defined body of ethics. Most dramatically , the ethic of informed 
consent as it is interpreted by human subjects review boards at ... universities 
implicitly reinforces the political status quo" ( 1991: 12 0). 
Bourgois concludes that "It would be dangerous and arrogant to think that there 
are definite answers to any of these ethicaVmoral questions. We need to discuss them 
and think about them in both practical and theoretical terms" (1991:122-3). It is 
also notable that this article was published in Faye Harrison's ground breaking edited 
volume, Decoloni zing Anthropo logy, published in 1991. At that time he could write 
that ''few self-respecting anthropologists would condone the exercise of anthropol­
ogy at the service of a world superpower or as a complement to espionage" 
(1991: 111 ). However, as noted in the introduction to Part V, we see that this is 
being challenged, and there are now anthropologists who are prepared to condone 
this in support of US President Bush's and UK Prime Minister Blair's "war on 
terror." This has not only exacerbated the dangers and hazards of anthropol ogical 
fieldwork, but reinforces the criticism that in the 1990s there was a shift to the right 
in the discipline, marked by the weakening of the AAA code of ethics, which rep­
resents a trend toward the "recolonizat ion" of the discipline. 
Gerald Berreman has been one of the leading actors and spokespersons involved 
in the dialogue over ethics during the past four decades. In "Ethics versus 'Realism' 
in Anthropology" (1991), he presents a strong defense of the preservation of the 
core features of the original code, the Principles of Professional Respons ibility. 
Berreman was a member of the AAA Committee on Ethics during some of the most 
turbulent times in the history of the discipline, and was one of the drafters of the 
original PPR in 1971. Berreman fears a neoliberal return to an immoral and instru­
mental interv entionism. He describes what he sees as the evisceration of the origi­
nal AAA code of ethics, leading up to the adoption of the new code in 1998, and 
offers an excellent discussion of the issue of clandestine research, a subject which 
is of renewed relevance today during a "new era" in which much anthropo logical 
research is increasingly subject to contract-client restriction. 
Berreman's article is the most important and damning critique of the changes in 
rhe AAA code of ethics. These changes were driven by the interests of the growing 
number of anthropologists employed outside of universities in the private sector, 
and the new code is partly intended to prevent the division of the profession into 
"academic'' and "practicing" moieties. Berreman decries the shift away from ide­
alism (and aiJ notions of universal human rights, ethics, or morals are, by defini­
tion, idealistic} toward self-centered practicality , and he identifies four major 
removals that represent this shift -that paramount responsibility is to the people 
studied, the censuring of covert research, the principle of accountability for 
ethical violations, and the commitment to public duty rather than private interest. 
Berreman scathingly concludes (1991:52) that omitting these concerns results in 

INTRODUCTION 275 
not a code at all, but a mild statement of interest, and one conspicuously devoid of 
ethical content. It is in fact, a license for unfettered free-enterprise research, advising 
and engineering disguised as anthropol ogy, with the intent of employing the ethical 
reputation of the discipline to enable and facilitate a wide range of mission-o riented 
activities, including those of dubious ethical and even egregiously unethical nature. 
(1991:52) 
Many anthropolo gists, but particularly those in the Third World, share 
Berreman's view that such changes represent an ''abject surrender of principle to a 
misguided practical ity, a sacrifice of public interest to misperceived self-interest: 
replacing ethics with greed" (1991:57). Berreman coins the term "Reaganethics" to 
describe what he sees as the retreat away from more global, humanis tic concerns, 
embodied in the original code of ethics, toward a greater concern with the protec­
tion and preservation of academic careers and reputations. 
Finally, in "Healing Dilemmas" ( 1996), Donald Pollock addresses the ethical 
dilemmas of "doctoring" in the field, with regard to his fieldwork with the Kulina 
of western Brazil in the early 1980s. While the practical issues of amateur doctor­
ing are fairly common for anthropolo gists working in remote areas of the world, 
and was one of the first ethical issues addressed in the discipline (e.g., McCurdy 
1977), there are still few discussions of the ethical issues entailed. Pollock discusses 
the "dilemma of power" (1996:149) or politics in providing amateur medical care 
during fieldwork, which "arises for anthropo logists when our hosts request or even 
demand the benefits of western biomedicine, and when we find ourselves coerced, 
manipulat ed, or ordered to provide medical assistance" (1996:150). 
In considering the ethical issues of "the small-scale, amateur medical work of 
well-meaning anthropologists" (1996:156), Pollock observes that "in the case of 
fieldworkers, anthropolo gists who have few or no technical skills and little knowl­
edge of disease, and who have only the weakest ethical obligation, at best, to treat 
sick people (and traditionally strong ethical obligations not to impose western 
culture on indigenous communities), nonetheless plunge right in and play doctor'' 
(1996:150). While anthropologists have generally been reluctant to engage in such 
practices, they have often felt pressured to do so, not least by their own belief that 
providing medical assistance is a minimal form of reciprocity -of giving something 
back or trying to help the community in some immediate and practical way for their 
consenting to allow the researcher to work with them. Pollock also discusses the 
ethical dilemma of not doctoring in the field, which he argues is partly the conse­
quence of the positivist assumption that anthropologists should maintain the ratio­
nal and detached researche r's view, "marginal yet informed," observing all around 
them without becoming involved in or a part of it (1996:154). 
Regardless of the ongoing debates and issues surrounding research ethics, today 
anthropologists increasingly believe that solutions to ethical problems that arise 
during fieldwork should be found through negotiation. The trend is toward ethical 
"contracts" or agreements worked out in the field with research participants. While 
codes of ethics provide useful guidelines, in the field ethical research relationships 
must be actively, if not creatively , negotiated and adapted to the specifics of the 
situation or context.
