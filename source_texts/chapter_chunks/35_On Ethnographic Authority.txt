On Ethnographic Authority 
James Clifford 
1 On Ethnog raphic 
Autho rity 
The 1724 frontispiece of Father Lafitau's 
Moeurs des sauvages ameriquains portrays the 
ethnographer as a young woman sitting at a 
writing table amid artifacts from the New 
World and from classical Greece and Egypt. 
The author is accompanied by two cherubs 
who assist in the task of comparison and by 
the bearded figure of Time, who points toward 
a tableau representing the ultimate source of 
the truths issuing from the writer's pen. The 
image toward which the young woman lifts 
her gaze is a bank of cloud where Adam, Eve, 
and the serpent appear. Above them stand the 
redeemed man and woman of the Apocalypse, 
on either side of a radiant triangle bearing the 
Hebrew script for Yahweh. 
The frontispiece for Malinowski' s Arg­
onauts of the Western Pacific is a photograph 
with the caption "A Ceremonial Act of the 
Kula." A shell necklace is being offered to a 
Trobriand chief, who stands at the door of his 
dwelling. Behind the man presenting the neck­
lace is a row of six bowing youths, one of them 
sounding a conch. All the figures stand in 
profile, their attention apparently concentrated 
on the rite of exchange, a real event of Melane­
sian life. But on closer inspection one of the bowing Trobrianders may be seen to be 
looking at the camera. 
Lafitau's allegory is the less familiar: his 
author transcribes rather than originates. 
Unlike Malinowski' s photo, the engraving 
makes no reference to ethnographic experien ce 
-despite Lafitau's five years of research among 
the Mohawks, research that has earned him a 
respected place among the fieldworkers of any 
generation. His account is presented not as 
the product of firsthand observation but of 
writing, in a crowded workshop. The fron­
tispiece from Argonauts, like all photographs, 
asserts presence -that of the scene before the 
lens; it also suggests another presence -that of 
the ethnographer actively composing this frag­
ment of Trobriand reality. Kula exchange, the 
subject of Malinowski's book, has been made 
perfectly visible, centered in the perceptual 
frame, while a participant 's glance redirects 
our attention to the observational standpoint 
we share, as readers, with the ethnographer 
and his camera. The predominant mode of 
modem fieldwork authority is signaled: "You 
are there ... because I was there. n 
This chapter traces the formation and 
breakup of ethnographic authority in twenti­
eth-century social anthrop ology. It is not a 
complete account, nor is it based on a fully 
realized theory of ethnographic interpretation

and textuality.1 Such a theory's contours are 
problematic, since the activity of cross-cultural 
representation is now more than usually in 
question. The present predicament is linked to 
the breakup and redistribution of colonial 
power in the decades after 1950 and to the 
echoes of that process in the radical cultural 
theories of the 1960s and 1970s. After the 
negritude movemen t's reversal of the European 
gaze, after anthropolog y's crise de conscience 
with respect to its liberal status within the 
imperial order, and now that the West can no 
longer present itself as the unique purveyor of 
anthropological knowledge about others, it 
has become necessary to imagine a world of 
generalized ethnograp hy. With expanded com­
munication and intercultural influence, people 
interpret others, and themselves, in a bewil­
dering diversity of idioms - a global condition 
of wnat Mikhail Bakhtin (1953) called "het­
eroglossia. "2 This ambiguous, multivocal 
world makes it increasingly hard to conceive 
of human diversity as inscribed in bounded, 
independent cultures. Difference is an effect of 
inventive syncretism. In recent years works 
such as Edward Said's Orienta/ism ( 1978) and 
Paulin Hountondji's Sur Ia "philosophie" 
africaine (1977) have cast radical doubt on the 
procedures by which alien human groups can 
be represented without proposing systematic, 
sharply new methods or epistemologies. These 
studies suggest that while ethnographic writing 
cannot entirely escape the reductionist use of 
dichotomies and essences, it can at least 
struggle self-consciously to avoid portraying 
abstract, a historical "others." It is more than 
ever crucial for different peoples to form 
complex concrete images of one another, as 
well as of the relationships of knowledge and 
power that connect them; but no sovereign sci­
entific method or ethical stance can guarantee 
the truth of such images. They are constituted 
-the critique of colonial modes of representa­
tion has shown at least this much -in specific 
historical relations of domin ance and dialogue. 
The experiments in ethnographic writing 
surveyed in this chapter do not fall into a clear 
reformist direction or evolution. They are ad 
hoc inventions and cannot be seen in terms of 
a systematic analysis of postcolonial represen­
tation. They are perhaps best understood as 
components of that "toolkit" of engaged theory recently recommended by Gilles 
Deleuze and Michel Foucault: "The notion of 
theory as a toolkit means (i) The theory to be 
constructed is not a system but an instrument, 
a logic of the specificity of power relations and 
the struggles around them; (ii) That this inves­
tigation can only be carried out step by step 
on the basis of reflection (which will necessar­
ily be historical in some of its aspects) on given 
situations" (Foucault 1980:145; see also 
1977:208). We may contribute to a practical 
reflection on cross-cultural representation by 
undertaking an inventory of the better, though 
imperfect, approaches currently at hand. Of 
these, ethnographic fieldwork remains an 
unusually sensitive method. Participant obser­
vation obliges its practitioners to experience, 
at a bodily as well as an intellectual level, the 
vicissitudes of translation. It requires arduous 
language learning, some degree of direct 
involvement and conversation, and often a 
derangement of personal and cultural expecta­
tions. There is, of course, a myth of fieldwork. 
The actual experience, hedged around with 
contingencies, rarely lives up to the ideal; but 
as a means for producing knowledge from an 
intense, intersubjective engagement, the prac­
tice of ethnography retains a certain exemplary 
status. Moreover, if fieldwork has for a time 
been identified with a uniquely Western 
discipline and a totalizing science of 
"anthropolo gy," these associations are not 
necessarily permanent. Current styles of cul­
tural description are historically limited and 
are undergoing important metamorphoses. 
The development of ethnographic science 
cannot ultimately be understood in isolation 
from more general political-ep istemological 
debates about writing and the representation 
of otherness. In this discussion, however, I 
have maintained a focus on professional 
anthropolo gy, and specifically on ethnography 
since 1950.3 The current crisis-or better, dis­
persion -of ethnographic authority makes it 
possible to mark off a rough period, bounded 
by the years 1900 and 1960, during which a 
new conception of field research established 
itself as the norm for European and American 
anthropol ogy. Intensive fieldwork, pursued by 
university-trained specialists, emerged as a 
privileged, sanctioned source of data about 
exotic peoples. It is not a question here of the 

478 JAMES CLIFFORD 
dominance of a single research method. 
"Intensive" ethnography has been variously 
defined. (Compare Griaule 1957 with 
Malinowski 1922:chap. 1 ). Moreover, the 
hegemony of fieldwork was established earlier 
and more thoroughly in the United States and 
in England than in France. The early examples 
of Franz Boas and the Torres Straits expedition 
were matched only belatedly by the founding 
of the lnstitut d'Ethnol ogie in 1925 and the 
much-publi cized Mission Dakar-Djibouti of 
1932 (Karady 1982; Jamin 1982; Stocking 
1983). Nevertheless, by the mid-1 930s one can 
fairly speak of a developing international con­
sensus: valid anthropological abstractions 
were to be based, wherever possible, on inten­
sive cultural descriptions by qualified scholars. 
By this point the new style had been made 
popular, institutionalized, and embodied in 
specific textual practices. 
It has recently become possible to identify 
and take a certain distance from these con­
ventions.4 If ethnography produces cultural 
interpretations through intense research expe­
riences, how is unruly experience transformed 
into an authoritative written account? How, 
precisely , is a garrulous, overdetermined cross­
cultural encounter shot through with power 
relations and personal cross-purposes circum­
scribed as an adequate version of a more or 
less discrete "'other world" composed by an 
individual author? 
In analyzing this complex transformation 
one must bear in mind the fact that ethnogra­
phy is, from beginning to end, enmeshed in 
writing. This writing includes, minimally , a 
translation of experience into textual form. 
The process is complicated by the action of 
multiple subjectivities and political constraints 
beyond the control of the writer. In response 
to these forces ethnographic writing enacts a 
specific strategy of authority. This strategy has 
classically involved an unquestioned claim to 
appear as the purveyor of truth in the text. A 
complex cultural experience is enunciat ed by 
an individual: We the Tikopia by Raymond 
Firth; Nous avons mange Ia foret by Georges 
Condominas; Coming of Age in Samoa by 
Margaret Mead; The Nuer by E. E. Evans­
Pritchard. 
The discussion that follows first locates this 
authority historically in the development of a twentieth-century science of participant obser­
vation. It then proceeds to a critique of under­
lying assumptions and a review of emerging 
textual practices. Alternate strategies of ethno­
graphic authority may be seen in recent exper­
iments by ethnographers who self-consciously 
reject scenes of cultural representation in the 
style of Malinowski's frontispiece. Different 
secular versions of Lafitau's crowded scriptor­
ial workshop are emerging. In the new para­
digms of authority the writer is no 
longer fascinated by transcendent figures -a 
Hebrew-Christian deity or its twentieth­
century replacements, Man and Culture. 
Nothing remains of the heavenly tableau 
except the anthropologist's scumbled image in 
a mirror. The silence of the ethnographic 
workshop has been broken -by insistent, het­
eroglot voices, by the scratching of other pens.5 
At the close of the nineteenth century nothing 
guaranteed, a priori, the ethnographer 's status 
as the best interpreter of native life -as 
opposed to the traveler, and especially the mis­
sionary and administrator, some of whom had 
been in the field far longer and had better 
research contacts and linguistic skills. The 
development of the fieldwor ker's image in 
America, from Frank Hamilton Cushing (an 
oddball) to Margaret Mead (a national figure) 
is significant. During this period a particular 
form of authority was created -an authority 
both scientifically validated and based on a 
unique personaJ experience. During the 1920s 
Malinowski played a central role in establish­
ing credit for the fieldwor ker, and we should 
recall in this light his attacks on the compe­
tence of competitors in the field. For example 
the colonial magistrate Alex Rentoul, who had 
the temerity to contradict science's findings 
concerning Trobriand conceptions of pater­
nity, was excommunicated in the pages of Man 
for his unprofessional "police court perspec­
tive" (see Rentoul 1931a,b; Malinowski 
1932). The attack on amateurism in the field 
was pressed even further by A. R. Radcliffe­
Brown, who, as Ian Langham has shown, came 
to epitomize the scientific professional, 
discovering rigorous social laws (Langham 
1981:chap. 7). What emerged during the first 
half of the twentieth century with the success 
of profess ional fieldwork was a new fusion of 

ON ETHNOGRAPHIC AUTHORITY 479 
general theory and empirical research, of cul­
tural analysis with ethnographic description. 
The fieldworker-theorist replaced an older 
partition between the "man on the spot" (in 
James Frazer's words) and the sociologist or 
anthropologist in the metropole. This division 
of labor varied in different national traditions. 
In the United States for example Morgan had 
personal knowledge of at least some of the cul­
tures that were raw material for his sociologi­
cal syntheses; and Boas rather early on made 
intensive fieldwork the sine qua non of 
serious anthropological discourse. In general, 
however, before Malinowski, Radcliffe­
Brown, and Mead had successfulJy established 
the norm of the university-trained scholar 
testing and deriving theory from firsthand 
research, a rather different economy of ethno­
graphic knowledge prevailed. For example 
The Melanesians (1891) by R. H. Codrington 
is a detailed compilation of folklore and 
custom, drawn from his relatively long term of 
research as an evangelist and based on inten­
sive collaboration with indigenous translators 
and informants. The book is not organized 
around a fieldwork '"experience," nor does it 
advance a unified interpretive hypothesis, 
functional, historical, or otherwise. It is 
content with low-level generalizations and the 
amassing of an eclectic range of information. 
Codrington is acutely aware of the incom­
pleteness of his knowledge, believing that real 
understanding of native life begins only after a 
decade or so of experience and study 
(pp. vi-vii). This understanding of the diffi­
culty of grasping the world of alien peoples -
the many years of learning and unlearning 
needed, the problems of acquiring thorough 
linguistic competence -tended to dominate the 
work of Codrington's generation. Such 
assumptions would soon be challenged by the 
more confident cultural relativism of the Mali­
nowskian model. The new fieldworkers 
sharply distinguished themselves from the 
earlier "men on the spot" -the missionar y, the 
administrat or, the trader, and the traveler -
whose knowledge of indigenous peoples, they 
argued, was not informed by the best scientific 
hypotheses or a sufficient neutrality. 
Before the emergence of professional 
ethnography , writers such as J. F. Mclennan, 
John Lubbock, and E. B. Tylor had attempted to control the quality of the reports on which 
their anthropological syntheses were based. 
They did this by means of the guidelines of 
Notes and Queries and, in Tylor's case, by cul­
tivating long-term working relations with 
sophisticated researchers in the field such as 
the missionary Lorimer Fison. After 1883, as 
newly appointed reader in anthropolo gy at 
Oxford, T ylor worked to encourage the sys­
tematic gathering of ethnographic data by 
qualified professionals. The United States 
Bureau of Ethnology, already commin ed to the 
undertaking, provided a model. Tylor was 
active in founding a committee on the North­
western Tribes of Canada. The comminee's 
first agent in the field was the nineteen-year ­
veteran missionary among the Ojibwa, E. F. 
Wilson. He was replaced before long by Boas, 
a physicist in the process of turning to profes­
sional ethnography. George Stocking has per­
suasively argued that the replacement of 
Wilson by Boas "marks the beginning of an 
important phase in the development of British 
ethnographic method: the collection of data by 
academically trained natural scientists defining 
themselves as anthropologists, and involved 
also in the formulation and evaluation of 
anthropological theory" (1983:7 4 ). With 
Boas' early survey work and the emergence in 
the 1890s of other natural-scientist fieldwork­
ers such as A. C. Haddon and Baldwin 
Spencer, the move toward professional ethnog­
raphy was under way. The Torres Straits expe­
dition of 1899 may be seen as a culmination 
of the work of this "intermediate generation," 
as Stocking calls them. The new style of 
research was clearly different from that of mis­
sionaries and other amateurs in the field, and 
part of a general trend since Tylor ''to draw 
more closely together the empirical and theo­
retical components of anthropological 
inquiry" ( 1983:72). 
The establishment of intensive participant 
observation as a professional norm, however, 
would have to await the Malinowskian cohort. 
The "intermediate generation" of ethnogra­
phers did not typically live in a single locale for 
a year or more, mastering the vernacular and 
undergoing a personal learning experience 
comparable to an initiation. They did not 
speak as cultural insiders but retained the 
natural scientist's documentary, observational 

480 JAMES CLIFFORD 
stance. The principal exception before the third 
decade of the century, Frank Hamilton 
Cushing, remained an isolated instance. As 
Curtis Hinsley has suggested, Cushing's 
long firsthand study of the Zunis, his quasi­
absorption into their way of life, "raised prob­
lems of verification and accountability ... A 
community of scientific anthropology on the 
model of other sciences required a common 
language of discourse, channels of regular com­
munication, and at least minimal consensus on 
judging method" (1983:66). Cushing's intu­
itive, excessively personal understanding of the 
Zuni could not confer scientific authority. 
Schematically put, before the late nineteenth 
century the ethnographer and the anthropolo­
gist, the describer -translator of custom and the 
builder of general theories about humanit y, 
were distinct. (A clear sense of the tension 
between ethnography and anthropology is 
imponant in correctly perceiving the recent, 
and perhaps temporary, conflation of the two 
projects.) Malinowski gives us the image of the 
new "anthropologist" -squatting by the 
campfire; looking, listening, and questioning; 
recording and interpreting Trobriand life. The 
literary chaner of this new authority is the first 
chapter of Argonauts, with its prominently 
displayed photographs of the ethnograph er's 
tent pitched among Kiriwinian dwellings. The 
sharpest methodological justification for the 
new mode is to be found in Radcliffe-Brown' s 
Andaman Islanders (1922). The two books 
were published within a year of each other. 
And although their authors developed quite 
different fieldwork styles and visions of cul­
tural science, both early texts provide explicit 
arguments for the special authority of the 
ethnographer -anthropologist. 
Malinowski, as his notes for the crucial 
introduction to Argonauts show, was greatly 
concerned with the rhetorical problem of 
convincing his readers that the facts he was 
putting before them were objectively acquired, 
not subjective creations (Stocking 1983:105). 
Moreover, he was fully aware that "in Ethnog­
raphy, the distance is often enormous between 
the brute material of information -as it is pre­
sented to the student in his own observations, 
in native statement, in the kaleidoscope of 
tribal life -and the final authoritative presen­
tation of the results" (Malinowski 1922:3-4). Stocking has nicely analyzed the various liter­
ary anifices of Argonauts (its engaging narra­
tive constructs, use of the active voice in the 
"ethnographic present,'' illusive dramatiza­
tions of the author's panicipation in scenes of 
Trobriand life), techniques Malinowski used 
so that "his own experience of the natives' 
experience [might] become the reader's experi­
ence as well" (Stocking 1983:106; see also 
Payne 1981). The problems of verification and 
accountability that had relegated Cushing to 
the professional margin were very much on 
Malinowski's mind. This anxiety is reflected in 
the mass of data contained in Argonauts, its 
sixty-six photographic plates, the now rather 
curious "Chronolo gical List of Kula Events 
Witnessed by the Writer," the constant alter­
nation between impersonal description of 
typical behavior and statements on the order 
of "I witnessed ... " and "Our party, sailing 
from the North ... " 
Argonauts is a complex narrative simulta� 
neously of Trobriand life and ethnographic 
fieldwork. It is archetypical of the generation 
of ethnographies that successfully established 
the scientific validity of participant observa­
tion. The story of research built into Arg­
onauts, into Mead's popular work in Samoa, 
and into We the Tikopia became an implicit 
narrative underlying all professional reports 
on exotic worlds. If subsequent ethnographies 
did not need to include developed fieldwork 
accounts, it was because such accounts were 
assumed, once a statement was made on the 
order of, for example, Godfrey Lienhardt's 
single sentence at the beginning of Divinity 
and Experience (1961:vii): "This book is 
based upon two years' work among the Dinka, 
spread over the period of 1947-1950." 
In the 1920s the new fieldwork er-theorist 
brought to completion a powerful new scien­
tific and literary genre, the ethnography , a syn­
thetic cultural description based on participant 
observation (Thornton 1983). The new style of 
representation depended on institutional and 
methodological innovations circumventing the 
obstacles to rapid knowledge of other cultures 
that had preoccupied the best representativ es 
of Codrington's generation. These may be 
briefly summarized. 
First, the persona of the fieldworker was val­
idated, both publicly and professionally. In the 

ON ETHNOGRAPHIC AUTHORITY 481 
popular domain, visible figures such as 
Malinowski, Mead, and Marcel Griaule com­
municated a vision of ethnography as both sci­
entifically demanding and heroic. The pro­
fessional ethnographer was trained in the latest 
analytic techniques and modes of scientific 
explanation. This conferred an advantage over 
amateurs in the field: the professional could 
claim to get to the heart of a culture more 
quickly, grasping its essential institutions and 
structures. A prescribed attitude of cultural rel­
ativism distinguished the fieldworker from 
missionaries, administrators, and others whose 
view of natives was, presumably , less dispas­
sionate, who were preoccupied with the prob­
lems of government or conversion. In addition 
to scientific sophistication and relativist sym­
pathy, a variety of normative standards for the 
new form of research emerged: the fieldworker 
was to live in the native village, use the ver­
nacular, stay a sufficient (but seldom specified) 
length of time, investigate certain classic sub­
jects, and so on. 
Second, it was tacitly agreed that the new­
style ethnograph er, whose sojourn in the field 
seldom exceeded two years, and more fre­
quently was much shorter, could efficiently 
"use" native languages without "mastering" 
them. In a significant article of 1939 Margaret 
Mead argued that the ethnographer following 
the Malinowskian prescription to avoid inter­
preters and to conduct research in the vernac­
ular did not, in fact, need to attain "virtuosity" 
in native tongues, but could "use" the vernac­
ular to ask questions, maintain rapport, and 
generally get along in the culture while obtain­
ing good research results in particular areas of 
concentration. This in effect justified her own 
practice, which featured relatively short stays 
and a focus on specific domains such as child­
hood or "personality," foci that would func­
tion as "types" for a cultural synthesis. Her 
attitude toward language "use" was broadly 
characteristic of an ethnographic generation 
that could, for example, credit as authoritative 
a study called The Nuer that was based on 
only eleven months of very difficult research. 
Mead's article provoked a sharp response from 
Robert Lowie (1940), writing from the older 
Boasian tradition, more philological in its ori­
entation. But his was a rear-guard action; the 
point had been generally established that valid research could, in practice, be accomplished on 
the basis of one or two years' familiarity with 
a foreign vernacular (even though, as Lowie 
suggested, no one would credit a translation of 
Proust that was based on an equivalent knowl­
edge of French). 
Third, the new ethnography was marked by 
an increased emphasis on the power of obser­
vation. Culture was construed as an ensemble 
of characteristic behaviors, ceremonies, and 
gestures susceptible to recording and explana­
tion by a trained onlooker . Mead pressed this 
point furthest (indeed, her own powers of 
visual analysis were extraord inary). As a 
general trend the participa nt-observer emerged 
as a research norm. Of course successful 
fieldwork mobilized the fullest possible range 
of interactions, but a distinct primacy was 
accorded to the visual: interpretation was tied 
to description. After Malinowski a general 
suspicion of "privileged informants" reflected 
this systematic preference for the (methodical) 
observations of the ethnographer over the 
(interested) interpretations of indigenous 
authorities. 
Fourth, certain powerful theoretical abstrac­
tions promised to help academic ethnogra­
phers "get to the heart" of a culture 
more rapidly than someone undertaking, for 
example, a thorough inventory of customs and 
belief. Without spending years getting to know 
natives, their complex languages and habits, in 
intimate detail, the researcher could go after 
selected data that would yield a central arma­
ture or structure of the cultural whole. Rivers' 
"genealogical method," followed by Radcliffe­
Brown's model of "social structure," provided 
this sort of shortcut. One could, it seemed, 
elicit kin terms without a deep understanding 
of local vernacular , and the range of necessary 
contextual knowledge was conveniently 
limited. 
Fifth, since culture, seen as a complex 
whole, was always too much to master in a 
short research span, the new ethnographer 
intended to focus thematically on particular 
institutions. The aim was not to contribute to 
a complete inventory or description of custom 
but rather to get at the whole through one or 
more of its parts. I have noted the privilege 
given for a time to social structure. An indi­
vidual life cycle, a ritual complex like the Kula 

482 JAMES CLIFFORD 
ring or the Naven ceremony , could also serve, 
as could categories of behavior like econom­
ics, politics, and so on. In the predominantly 
synecdochic rhetorical stance of the new 
ethnogra phy, parts were assumed to be micro­
cosms or analogies of wholes. This setting of 
institutional foregrounds against cultural 
backgrounds in the portrayal of a coherent 
world lent itself to realist literary conventions. 
Sixth, the wholes thus represented tended to 
be synchronic, products of short-term research 
activity. The intensive fieldworker could plau­
sibly sketch the contours of an "ethnographic 
present" -the cycle of a year, a ritual series, 
patterns of typical behavior . To introduce 
long-term historical inquiry would have 
impossibly complicat ed the task of the new­
style fieldwork. Thus, when Malinowski and 
Radcliffe-Brown established their critique of 
the "conjectural history" of the diffusionists, 
it was all too easy to exclude diachronic 
processes as objects of fieldwork, with conse­
quences that have by now been sufficiently 
denounced. 
These innovations served to validate an effi­
cient ethnography based on scientific partici­
pant observation. Their combined effect can be 
seen in what rna y well be the tour de force of 
the new ethnography , Evans-Pritchard' s study 
The Nuer, [first] published in 1940. Based on 
eleven months of research conducted -as the 
book's remarkable introduction tells us - in 
almost impossible conditions, Evans-Pritchard 
nonetheless was able to compose a classic. He 
arrived in Nuerland on the heels of a punitive 
military expedition and at the urgent request 
of the government of the Anglo-Egyptian 
Sudan. He was the object of constant and 
intense suspicion. Only in the final few months 
could he converse at all effectively with infor­
mants, who, he tells us, were skilled at evading 
his questions. In the circumstances his mono­
graph is a kind of miracle. 
While advancing limited claims and making 
no secret of the constraints on his research, 
Evans-Pritchard manages to present his study 
as a demonstration of the effectiveness of 
theory. He focuses on Nuer political and social 
"structure," analyzed as an abstract set of rela­
tions between territorial segments, lineages, 
age sets, and other more fluid groups. This analytically derived ensemble is portrayed 
against an "ecologica l" backdrop composed of 
migratory patterns, relationships with cattle, 
notions of time and space. Evans-Prit chard 
sharply distinguishes his method from what he 
calls "haphazard'' (Malinowskian) documen­
tation. The Nuer is not an extensive com­
pendium of observations and vernacular texts 
in the style of Malinowski's Argonauts and 
Coral Gardens. Evans-Pritchard argues rigor­
ously that "facts can only be selected and 
arranged in the light of theory." The frank 
abstraction of a political-social structure offers 
the necessary framework. If I am accused of 
describing facts as exemplifications of my 
theory, he then goes on to note, I have been 
understood (1969:261). 
In The Nuer Evans-Pritchard makes strong 
claims for the power of scientific abstraction 
·tO focus research and arrange complex data. 
The book often presents itself as an argument 
rather than a description, but not consistently: 
its theoretical argument is surrounded by skill­
fully observed and narrated evocations and 
interpretations of Nuer life. These passages 
function rhetorically as more than simple 
"exemplification," for they effectively impli­
cate readers in the complex subjectivity of par­
ticipant observation. This may be seen in a 
characteristic paragraph, which progresses 
through a series of discontinuous discursive 
positions: 
It is difficult to find an English word that ade­
quately describes the social position of die/ in 
a tribe. We have called them aristocrats, but 
do not wish to imply that Nuer regard them 
as of superior rank, for, as we have emphati­
cally declared, the idea of a man lording it 
over others is repugnant to them. On the 
whole -we will qualify the statement later -
the die/ have prestige rather than rank and 
influence rather than power. If you are a dil of 
the tribe in which you live you are more than 
a simple tribesman. You are one of the owners 
of the country, its village sites, its pasrures, its 
fishing pools and wells. Other people live 
there by virtue of marriage into your clan, 
adoption into your lineage, or of some other 
social tie. You are a leader of the tribe and the 
spear-name of your clan is invoked when the 
tribe goes to war. Whenever there is a dil in 
the village, the viJlage clusters around him as

a herd of cattle clusters around its bull. 
(1969:21 5). 
The first three sentences are presented as an 
argument about translation, but in passing 
they attribute to "Nuer" a stable set of atti­
tudes. (I will have more to say later about this 
style of attribution.) Next, in the four sen­
tences beginning "If you are a dil ... , " the 
second-person construction brings together 
reader and native in a textual participation. 
The final sentence, offered as a direct descrip­
tion of a typical event (which the reader now 
assimilates from the standpoint of a partici­
pant-observer), evokes the scene by means of 
Nuer cattle metaphors. In the paragraph' s 
eight sentences an argument about translation 
passes through a fiction of participation to a 
metaphorical fusion of external and indige­
nous cultural descriptions. The subjective 
joining of abstract analysis and concrete expe­
rience is accomplished. 
Evans-Pritchard would later move away 
from the theoretical position of The Nuer, 
rejecting its advocacy of "social structure" as 
a privileged framework. Indeed each of the 
fieldwork "shortcuts" I enumerated earlier 
was and remains contested. Yet by their 
deployment in different combinations, the 
authority of the academic fieldworker -theorist 
was established in the years between 1920 and 
19 50. This peculiar amalgam of intense per­
sonal experience and scientific analysis (under­
stood in this period as both ''rite of passage" 
and "laboratory ") emerged as a method: par­
ticipant observation. Though variously under­
stood, and now disputed in many quarters, 
this method remains the chief distinguishing 
feature of professional anthropol ogy. Its 
complex subjectivity is routinely reproduced in 
the writing and reading of ethnographies. 
"Participant observati on" serves as shorthand 
for a continuous tacking between the "inside" 
and "outside'' of events: on the one hand 
grasping the sense of specific occurrences and 
gestures empathetical ly, on the other stepping 
back to situate these meanings in wider con­
texts. Particular events thus acquire deeper or 
more general significance, structural rules, and 
so forth. Understood literally, participant 
observation is a paradoxical, misleading formula, but it may be taken seriously if refor­
mulated in hermeneutic terms as a dialectic of 
experience and interpretation. This is how the 
method's most persuasive recent defenders 
have restated it, in the tradition that leads from 
Wilhelm Dilthey, via Max Weber, to "symbols 
and meanings" anthropologists like Clifford 
Geertz. Experience and interpretation have, 
however, been accorded different emphases 
when presented as claims to authority. In 
recent years there has been a marked shift of 
emphasis from the former to the latter. This 
section and the one that follows will explore 
the rather different claims of experience and 
interpretation as well as their evolving 
interrelation. 
The growing prestige of the fieldworker ­
theorist downplayed (without eliminating) a 
number of processes and mediators that had 
figured more prominently in previous 
methods. We have seen how language mastery 
was defined as a level of use adequate for 
amassing a discrete body of data in a limited 
period of time. The tasks of textual transcrip­
tion and translation, along with the crucial 
dialogical role of interpreters and "privileged 
informants," were relegated to a secondary , 
sometimes even despised status. Fieldwork was 
centered in the experience of the participant­
observing scholar. A sharp image, or narrative, 
made its appearance -that of an outsider 
entering a culture, undergoing a kind of initi­
ation leading to "rapport" (minimally accep­
tance and empathy , but usually implying 
something akin to friendship). Out of this 
experience emerged, in unspecified ways, a 
representational text written by the partici­
pant-obser ver. As we shall see, this version of 
textual production obscures as much as it 
reveals. But it is worth taking seriously its prin­
cipal assumption: that the experience of the 
researcher can serve as a unifying source of 
authority in the field. 
[ ... ] 
Precisely because it is hard to pin down, 
"experience" has served as an effective guar­
antee of ethnographic authority. There is, of 
course, a telling ambiguity in the term. Expe­
rience evokes a participatory presence, a sen­
sitive contact with the world to be understood, 
a rapport with its people, a concreteness of 
perception. It also suggests a cumulative, 

484 JAMES CLIFFORD 
deepening knowledge ("her ten years' experi­
ence of New Guinea"). The senses work 
together to authorize an ethnographer's real 
but ineffable feel or flair for "his" or "her" 
people. It is worth noting, however , that this 
"world," when conceived as an experiential 
creation, is subjective, not dialogical or inter­
subjective. The ethnographer accumulates per­
sonal knowledge of the field (the possessive 
form my people has until recently been famil­
iarly used in anthropological circles, but the 
phrase in effect signifies "my experience"). 
It is understandable, given their vagueness, 
that experiential criteria of authority -
unexamined beliefs in the "method" of partic­
ipant observation, in the power of rapport, 
empathy, and so on-have come under criti­
cism by hermeneutically sophisticated anthro­
pologists. The second moment in the dialectic 
of experience and interpretation has received 
increasing attention and elaboration (see, for 
example, Geertz 1973, 1976; Rabinow and 
Sullivan 1979; Winner 1976; Sperber 1981). 
Interpretation, based on a philological model 
of textual "reading," has emerged as a sophis­
ticated alternative to the now apparently naive 
claims for experiential authority. Interpretive 
anthropology demystifies much of what had 
previously passed unexamined in the con­
struction of ethnographic narratives, types, 
observations, and descriptions. It contributes 
to an increasing visibility of the creative (and 
in a broad sense poetic) processes by which 
"'culturaP' objects are invented and treated as 
meaningful. 
What is involved in looking at culture as an 
assemblage of texts to be interpreted? A classic 
account has been provided by Paul Ricoeur, in 
his essay "The Model of Text: Meaningful 
Action Considered as a Text" (1971). Clifford 
Geertz in a number of stimulating and subtle 
discussions has adapted Ricoeur's theory to 
anthropological fieldwork (1973:chap. 1 ). 
"Texrualizarion" is understood as a prerequi­
site to interpretation, the constitution of 
Dilthey's "fixed expressions." It is the process 
through which unwritten behavior, speech, 
beliefs, oral tradition, and ritual come to be 
marked as a corpus, a potentially meaningful 
ensemble separated out from an immediate 
discursive or performative situation. In the moment of textualization this meaning ful 
corpus assumes a more or less stable relation 
to a context; and we are familiar with the end 
result of this process in much of what counts 
as ethnographic thick description. For 
example, we say that a certain institution or 
segment of behavior is typical of, or a com­
municative element within, a surrounding 
culture, as when Geertz's famous cockfight 
(1973:chap. 15) becomes an intensely signifi­
cant locus of Balinese culture. Fields of synec­
doches are created in which parts are related 
to wholes, and by which the whole-what we 
often call culture -is constituted. 
Ricoeur does not actually privilege part­
whole relations and the specific sorts of analo­
gies that constitute functionalist or realist 
representations. He merely posits a necessary 
relation between text and "world." A world 
cannot be apprehended directly; it is always 
inferred on the basis of its parts, and the parts 
must be conceptually and perceptually cut out 
of the flux of experience. Thus, textualization 
generates sense through a circular movement 
that isolates and then contextualizes a fact or 
event in its englobing reality. A familiar mode 
of authority is generated that claims to repre­
sent discrete, meaningful worlds. Ethnography 
is the interpretation of cultures. 
A second key step in Ricoeur's analysis is his 
account of the process by which "discourse" 
becomes text. Discourse, in Emile Benveniste's 
classic discussion (1971:217-30), is a mode of 
communication in which the presence of the 
speaking subject and of the immediate situa­
tion of communication are intrinsic. Discourse 
is marked by pronouns (pronounced or 
implied) I and you, and by deictic indicators -
this, that, now, and so on -that signal the 
present instance of discourse rather than some­
thing beyond it. Discourse does not transcend 
the specific occasion in which a subject appro­
priates the resources of language in order to 
communicate dialogically. Ricoeur argues that 
discourse cannot be interpreted in the open­
ended, potentially public way in which a text 
is "read." To understand discourse "you had 
to have been there," in the presence of the dis­
coursing subject. For discourse to become text 
it must become "autonomous,, in Ricoeur's 
terms, separated from a specific utterance and 
authorial intention. Interpretation is not inter-

ON ETHNOGRAPHIC AUTHORtlY 485 
locution. It does not depend on being in the 
presence of a speaker. 
The relevance of this distinction for ethnog­
raphy is perhaps too obvious. The ethnogra­
pher always ultimately departs, taking away 
texts for later interpretation (and among those 
"texts" taken away we can include memories 
-events patterned, simplified, stripped of 
immediate context in order to be interpreted 
in later reconstruction and portrayal). The 
text, unlike discourse, can travel. If much 
ethnographic writing is produced in the field, 
actual composition of an ethnography is done 
elsewhere. Data constituted in discursive, 
dialogical conditions are appropriated only in 
textualized forms. Research events and 
encounters become field notes. Experiences 
become narratives, meaningful occurrences, or 
examples. 
This translation of the research experience 
into a textual corpus separate from its discur­
sive occasions of production has important 
consequences for ethnographic authority. The 
data thus reformulated need no longer be 
understood as the communication of specific 
persons. An informant's explanation or 
description of custom need not be cast in a 
form that includes the message "so and so said 
this." A textualized ritual or event is no longer 
closely linked to the production of that event 
by specific actors. Instead these texts become 
evidences of an englobing context, a "cultural" 
reality. Moreover, as specific authors and 
actors are severed from their productions, a 
generalized "author" must be invented to 
account for the world or context within which 
the texts are fictionally relocated. This gener­
alized author goes under a variety of names: 
the native point of view, "the Trobrianders,,., 
"the Nuer," "the Dogon," as these and similar 
phrases appear in ethnographies. "The Bali­
nese" function as author of Geertz's texrual­
ized cockfight. 
The ethnographer thus enjoys a special rela­
tionship with a cultural origin or "absolute 
subject" (Michel-Jones 1978:14). It is tempt­
ing to compare the ethnographer with the lit­
erary interpreter (and this comparison is 
increasingly commonplace) - but more specif­
ically with the traditional critic, who sees the 
task at hand as locating the unruly meanings 
of a text in a single coherent intention. By rep-resenting the Nuer, the Trobrianders, or the 
Balinese as whole subjects, sources of a mean­
ingful intention, the ethnographer transforms 
the research situation's ambiguities and diver­
sities of meaning into an integrated portrait. It 
is important, though, to notice what has 
dropped out of sight. The research process is 
separated from the texts it generates and from 
the fictive world they are made to call up. The 
actuality of discursive situations and individ­
ual interlocutors is filtered out. But informants 
-along with field notes -are crucial interme­
diaries, typically excluded from authoritative 
ethnographies. The dialogical, situational 
aspects of ethnographic interpretation tend to 
be banished from the final representative text. 
Not entirely banished, of course; there exist 
approved topoi for the portrayal of the 
research process. 
We are increasingly familiar with the sepa­
rate fieldwork account (a subgenre that still 
tends to be classified as subjective, "soft", or 
unscientific), but even within classic ethnogra­
phies, more-or-less stereotypic "fables of 
rapport" narrate the attainment of full partic­
ipant-observer status. These fables may be told 
elaborately or in passing, naively or ironically . 
They normally portray the ethnographer's 
early ignorance, misunderstanding, lack of 
contact -frequently a sort of childlike status 
within the culture. In the Bildzmgsge schichte of 
the ethnography these states of innocence or 
confusion are replaced by adult, confident, dis­
abused knowledge. We may cite again Geertz's 
cockfight, where an early alienation from the 
Balinese, a confused "nonperson" status, is 
transformed by the appealing fable of the 
police raid with its show of complicity 
(1973:41 2-17). The anecdote establishes a 
presumption of connectedness, which permits 
the writer to function in his subsequent analy­
ses as an omnipresent, knowledgeable exegete 
and spokesman. This interpreter situates rhe 
ritual sport as a text in a contextual world and 
brilliantly "reads'' its cultural meanings. 
Geertz's abrupt disappearance into his rapport 
-the quasi-invisibil ity of participant observa­
tion -is paradigmatic. Here he makes use of 
an established convention for staging the 
attainment of ethnographic authority. As a 
result, we are seldom made aware of the fact 
that an essential pan of the cockfight's 

486 JAMES CLIFFORD 
construction as a text is dialogical -the 
author's talking face to face with particular 
Balinese rather than reading culture "over 
the[ir] shoulders" (1973:452). 
Interpretive anthropo logy, by viewing cultures 
as assembl ages of texts, loosely and sometimes 
contradictorily united, and by highlighting 
the inventive poesis at work in all collective 
representations, has contributed significantly 
to the defamiliarization of ethnogra phic 
authority. In its mainstream realist strands, 
however, it does not escape the general stric� 
tures of those critics of "colonial" representa� 
tion who, since 1950, have rejected discourses 
that portray the cultural realities of other 
peoples without placing their own reality in 
jeopardy. In Michel Leiris' early critiques, by 
way of jacques Maquet, Talal Asad, and many 
others, the unreciprocal quality of ethno­
graphic interpretation has been called to 
account (Leiris 1950; Maquet 1964; Asad 
1973 ). Henceforth neither the experience nor 
the interpretive activity of the scientific 
researcher can be considered innocent. It 
becomes necessary to conceive ethnography 
not as the experience and interpretation of a 
circumscribed "other" reality, but rather as a 
constructive negotiation involving at least two, 
and usually more, conscious, politically signif­
icant subjects. Paradigms of experience and 
interpretation are yielding to discursive para­
digms of dialogue and polyphony . The remain­
ing sections of this chapter wiiJ survey these 
emergent modes of authorit y. 
A discursive model of ethnographic practice 
brings into prominence the intersubjectivity of 
all speech, along with its immediate performa­
tive context. Benveniste's work on the consti­
tutive role of personal pronouns and deixis 
highlights just these dimensions. Every use of 
I presupposes a you, and every instance of dis­
course is immediately linked to a specific, 
shared situation: no discursive meaning, then, 
without interlocution and context. The rele­
vance of this emphasis for ethnography is 
evident. Fieldwork is significantly composed of 
language events; but language, in Bakhtin' s 
words, "lies on the borderline between oneself 
and the other. The word in language is half 
someone else's.'' The Russian critic urges 
a rethinking of language in terms of specific discursive situations:. "There are," he writes, 
"no 'neutral' words and forms -words and 
forms that can belong to 'no one'; language 
has been completely taken over, shot through 
with intentions and accents." The words of 
ethnographic writing, then, cannot be con­
strued as monological, as the authoritative 
statement about, or interpretation of, an 
abstracted, textualized reality. The language of 
ethnography is shot through with other sub­
jectivities and specific contextual overtones, 
for all language, in Bakhtin's view, is "a con­
crete heteroglot conception of the world" 
(1953:293). 
Forms of ethnographic writing that present 
themselves in a "discursive" mode tend to be 
concerned with the representation of research 
contexts and situations of interlocution. Thus 
a book like Paul Rabinow's Reflections on 
Fieldwork in Morocco ( 1977) is concerned 
with the representation of a specific research 
situation (a series of constraining times and 
places) and (in somewhat fictionalized form) a 
sequence of individual interlocutors. Indeed an 
entire new subgenre of ''fieldwork accounts" 
(of which Rabinow's is one of the most tren­
chant) may be situated within the discursive 
paradigm of ethnographic writing. Jeanne 
Favret�Saada's Les mots, Ia mort, les sorts 
( 1997) is an insistent, self-conscious experi­
ment with ethnography in a discursive mode.6 
She argues that the event of interlocution 
always assigns to the ethnographer a specific 
position in a web of intersubjective relations. 
There is no neutral standpoint in the power­
laden field of discursive positionings, in a shift­
ing matrix of relationships, of I's and you's. 
A number of recent works have chosen to 
present the discursive processes of ethnogra­
phy in the form of a dialogue between two 
individuals. Camille Lacoste-Dujardin' s Dia­
logue des femmes en ethnologie (1977), Jean­
Paul Dumont's The Headman and I (1978), 
and Marjorie Shostak's Nisa: The Life and 
Words of a !Kung Woman (1981) are note­
worthy examples. The dialogical mode is 
advocated with considerable sophistication in 
two other texts. The first, Kevin Dwyer's the­
oretical reflections on the "dialogic of ethnol­
ogy'; springs from a series of interviews with 
a key informant and justifies Dwyer's decision 
to structure his ethnography in the form of a 

ON ETHNOGRAPHIC AUTHORITY 487 
rather literal record of these exchanges ( 1977, 
1979, 1982). The second work is Vincent Cra­
panzano's more complex Tuhami: Portrait of 
a Moroccan, another account of a series of 
interviews that rejects any sharp separation of 
interpreting self from a textualized other 
(1980; see also 1977). Both Dwyer and Cra­
panzano locate ethnography in a process of 
dialogue where interlocutors actively negotiate 
a shared vision of reality. Crapanzano argues 
that this mutual construction must be at work 
in any ethnographic encounter , but that par­
ticipants tend to assume that they have simply 
acquiesced to the reality of their counterpart. 
Thus, for example, the ethnographer of the 
Trobriand Islanders does not openly concoct a 
version of reality in collaboration with his 
informants but rather interprets the "Tro­
briand point of view." Crapanzano and Dwyer 
offer sophisticated attempts to break with this 
literary-hermeneutical convention. In the 
process the ethnographer 's authority as narra­
tor and interpreter is altered. Dwyer proposes 
a hermeneutics of "vulnerabil ity," stressing the 
ruptures of fieldwork, the divided position and 
imperfect control of the ethnographer . Both 
Crapanzano and Dwyer seek to represent the 
research experience in ways that tear open the 
textualized fabric of the other, and thus also of 
the interpreting self.7 (Here etymologies are 
evocative: the word text is related, as is well 
know, to weaving, vulnerabi lity to rending or 
wounding, in this instance the opening up of 
a closed authorit y.) 
The model of dialogue brings to prominence 
precisely those discursive -circumstantial and 
intersubjective -elements that Ricoeur had to 
exclude from his model of the text. But if inter­
pretive authority is based on the exclusion of 
dialogue, the reverse is also true: a purely dia­
logical authority would repress the inescapable 
fact of textualization. While ethnographies 
cast as encounters between two individuals 
may successfu lly dramatize the intersubje ctive 
give-and-take of fieldwork and introduce a 
counterpoint of authorial voices, they remain 
representations of dialogue. As texts they may 
not be dialogical in structure, for as Steven 
Tyler (1981) points out, although Socrates 
appears as a decentered participant in his 
encounters, Plato retains full control of the 
dialogue. This displacement but not elimina-tion of monological authority is characteristic 
of any approach that portrays the ethnogra­
pher as a discrete character in the fieldwork 
narrative. Moreover, there is a frequent 
tendency in fictions of dialogue for the ethno­
grapher's counterpart to appear as a represen­
tative of his or her culture - a type, in the 
language of traditional realism -through 
which general social processes are revealed. 8 
Such a portrayal reinstates the synecdochic 
interpretive authority by which the ethnogra­
pher reads text in relation to context, thereby 
constituting a meaningful "other" world. If it 
is difficult for dialogical portrayals to escape 
typifying procedures, they can, to a significant 
degree, resist the pull toward authoritative rep­
resentation of the other. This depends on their 
ability fictionally to maintain the strangeness 
of the other voice and to hold in view the spe­
cific contingencies of the exchange. 
To say that an ethnography is composed of dis­
courses and that its different components are 
dialogically related is not to say that irs textual 
form should be that of a literal dialogue. 
Indeed as Crapanzano recognizes in Tuharni, a 
third participant, real or imagined, must func­
tion as mediator in any encounter between two 
individuals (1980: 14 7-51). The fictional dia­
logue is in fact a condensation, a simplified 
representation of complex multivocal 
processes. An alternative way of representing 
this discursive complexity is to understand the 
overall course of the research as an ongoing 
negotiation. The case of Marcel Griaule and 
the Dogon is well known and particularly 
clear-cut. Griaule's account of his instruction 
in Dogon cosmological wisdom, Dieu d'eau 
(1948), was an early exercise in dialogical 
ethnographic narration. Beyond this specific 
interlocutory occasion, however, a more 
complex process was at work, for it is appar­
ent that the content and timing of the Griaule 
team's longrerm research, spanning decades, 
was closely monitored and significantly shaped 
by Dogon tribal authorities. This is no longer 
news. Many ethnographers have commented 
on the ways, both subtle and blatant, in which 
their research was directed or circumscribed by 
their informants. In his provocative discussion 
of this issue loan Lewis ( 1973) even calls 
anthropolo gy a form of "plagiarism." 

488 JAMES CLIFFORD 
The give-and-take of ethnography is clearly 
portrayed in a 1980 study noteworthy for its 
presentation within a single work of both an 
interpreted other reality and the research 
process itself: Renato Rosaldo's Ilongot Head­
hunting. Rosaldo arrives in the Philippine 
highlands intent on writing a synchronic study 
of social structure; but again and again, over 
his objections, he is forced to listen to endless 
Ilongot narratives of local history. Dutifully, 
dumbly, in a kind of bored trance he tran­
scribes these stories, filling notebook after 
notebook with what he considers disposable 
texts. Only after leaving. the field, and after a 
long process of reinterpretation (a process 
made manifest in the ethnography), does he 
realize that these obscure tales have in fact pro­
vided him with his final topic, the culturally 
distinctive Ilongot sense of narrative and 
history. Rosaldo's experience of what might be 
called "directed writing" sharply poses a fun­
damental question: Who is actually the author 
of field notes? 
The issue is a subtle one and deserves sys­
tematic study. But enough has been said to 
make the general point that indigenous control 
over knowledge gained in the field can be 
considera ble, and even determining. Current 
ethnographic writing is seeking new ways to 
represent adequately the authority of infor­
mants. There are few models to look to, but it 
is worth reconsidering the older textual com­
pilations of Boas, Malinowski, Leenhardt, and 
others. In these works the ethnographic genre 
has not coalesced around the modern inter­
pretational monograph closely identified with 
a personal fieldwork experience. We can con­
template an ethnographic mode that is not yet 
authoritative in those specific ways that are 
now politically and epistemolog ically in ques­
tion. These older assembl ages include much 
that is actually or all but written by infor­
mants. One thinks of the role of George Hunt 
in Boas' ethnography , or of the fifteen "tran­
scripteurs" listed in Leenhar dt's Documents 
neo-caledoniens (1932).9 
Malinowski is a complex transitional case. 
His ethnographies reflect the incomplete coa­
lescence of the modern monograph. If he was 
centrally responsible for the welding of theory 
and description into the authority of the pro­
fessional fieldworker, Malinowski nonetheless included material that did not directly support 
his own all-too-clear interpretive slant. In the 
many dictated myths and spells that fill his 
books, he published much data that he admit­
tedly did not understand. The result was an 
open text subject to multiple reinterpretations. 
It is worth comparing such older compendi­
ums with the recent model ethnography , which 
cites evidence to support a focused interpreta­
tion but little else.10 In the modern, authorita­
tive monograph there are, in effect, no strong 
voices present except that of the writer; but in 
Argonauts (1922) and Coral Gardens (1935) 
we read page after page of magical spells, none 
in any essential sense in the ethnographer's 
words. These dictated texts in all but their 
physical inscription are written by specific 
unnamed Trobrianders. Indeed any continuous 
ethnographic exposition routinely folds into 
itself a diversity of descriptions, transcriptions, 
and interpretations by a variety of indigenous 
"author s." How should these authorial pres­
ences be made manifest? 
A useful -if extreme -standpoint is provided 
by Bakhtin's analysis of the "polyphoni c" 
novel. A fundamental condition of the genre, 
he argues, is that it represents speaking subjects 
in a field of multiple discourses. The novel 
grapples with, and enacts, heteroglossia. For 
Bakhtin, preoccupied with the representation 
of nonhomogeneous wholes, there are no 
integrated cultural worlds or languages. All 
attempts to posit such abstract unities are con­
structs of monological power. A "culture" is, 
concretely, an open-ended, creative dialogue of 
subcultures, of insiders and outsiders, of 
diverse factions. A "language" is the interplay 
and struggle of regional dialects, professional 
jargons, generic commonplaces, the speech of 
different age groups, individuals, and so forth. 
For Bakhtin the polyphonic novel is not a tour 
de force of cultural or historical totalization (as 
realist critics such as Georg Lukacs and Erich 
Auerbach have argued) but rather a carniva­
lesque arena of diversity. Bakhtin discovers a 
utopian textual space where discursive com­
plexity, the dialogical interplay of voices, can 
be accommodated. In the novels of Dos­
toyevsky or Dickens he values precisely their 
resistance to totality, and his ideal novelist is a 
ventriloquist - in nineteenth-century parlance 

ON ETHNOGRAPHIC AUTHORITY 489 
a "polyphonist ." "He do the police in different 
voices," a listener exclaims admiringly of the 
boy Sloppy, who reads publicly from the news­
paper in Our Mutual Friend. But Dickens the 
actor, oral performer, and polyphonist must be 
set against Flaubert, the master of authorial 
control, moving godlike among the thoughts 
and feelings of his characters. Ethnography , 
like the novel, wrestles with these alternatives. 
Does the ethnographic writer portray what 
natives think by means of Flaubertian "free 
indirect style," a style that suppresses direct 
quotation in favor of a controlling discourse 
always more or less that of the author? (Dan 
Sperber 1981, taking Evans-Pritchard as his 
example, has convincingly shown that style 
indirect is indeed the preferred mode of ethno­
graphic interpretat ion.) Or does the portrayal 
of other subjectivities require a version that is 
stylistically less homogeneous, filled with 
Dickens' "different voices"? 
Some use of indirect style is inevitable, 
unless the novel or ethnography is composed 
entirely of quotations, something that is theo­
retically possible but seldom attempted. 11 In 
practice, however, the ethnography and the 
novel have recourse to indirect style at differ­
ent levels of abstract ion. We need not ask how 
Flaubert knows what Emma Bovary is think­
ing, but the ability of the fieldworker to inhabit 
indigenous minds is always in doubt. Indeed 
this is a permanent, unresolved problem of 
ethnographic method. Ethnographers have 
generally refrained from ascribing beliefs, feel­
ings, and thoughts to individuals. They have 
not, however, hesitated to ascribe subjective 
states to cultures. Sperber's analysis reveals 
how phrases such as "the Nuer think ... " or 
"the Nuer sense of time" are fundamentally 
different from quotations or translations of 
indigenous discourse. Such statements are 
"without any specified speaker" and are liter­
ally equivocal, combining in a seamless way 
the ethnographer's affirmations with that of an 
informant or informants (1981:78). Ethno­
graphies abound in unattributed sentences 
such as "The spirits return to the village at 
night," descriptions of beliefs in which the 
writer assumes in effect the voice of culture. 
At this "cultural" level ethnographers aspire 
to a Flaubertian omniscience that moves freely 
throughout a world of indigenous subjects. Beneath the surface, though, their texts are 
more unruly and discordant. Victor Turner's 
work provides a telling case in point, worth 
investigating more closely as an example of 
the interplay of monophonic and polyphonic 
exposition. Turner's ethnographies offer 
superbly complex portrayals of Ndembu ritual 
symbols and beliefs; and he has provided too 
an unusually explicit glimpse behind the 
scenes. In the midst of the essays collected in 
The Forest of Symbols, his third book on the 
Ndembu, Turner offers a portrait of his best 
informant, "Muchona the Hornet, Interpreter 
of Religion'' (1967:131-50). Muchona, a 
ritual healer, and Turner are drawn together by 
their shared interest in traditional symbols, 
etymologies, and esoteric meanings. They are 
both "intellectuals, " passionate interpreters of 
the nuances and depths of custom; both are 
uprooted scholars sharing "the quenchless 
thirst for objective knowledge. " Turner com­
pares Muchona to a university don; his 
account of their collaboration includes more 
than passing hints of a strong psychological 
doubling. 
There is, however , a third present in their 
dialogue, Windson Kashinakaji, a Ndcmbu 
senior teacher at the local mission school. He 
brought Muchona and Turner together and 
shares their passion for the interpretation of 
customary religion. Through his biblical edu­
cation he "acquired a flair for elucidating 
knotty questions. " Newly skeptical of Christ­
ian dogma and missionary privileges, he is 
looking sympathetically at pagan religion. 
Kashinakaji, Turner tells us, "spanned the cul­
tural distance between Muchona and myself, 
transforming the little doctor's technical 
jargon and salty village argot into a prose I 
could berter grasp." The three intellectuals 
soon "settled down into a sort of daily seminar 
on religion. " Turner's accounts of this seminar 
are stylized: "eight months of exhilarating 
quickfire talk among the three of us, mainly 
about Ndembu ritual." They reveal an extra­
ordinary ethnographic ••colloquy"; but signif­
icantly Turner does not make his three-way 
collaboration the crux of his essay. Rather he 
focuses on Muchona, thus transforming tria­
logue into dialogue and flattening a complex 
productive relation into the "portrait" of an 
"informant. '' (This reduction was in some 

490 JAMES CLIFFORD 
degree required by the format of the book in 
which the essay first appeared, joseph 
Casagrande's important 1960 collection of 
"Twenty Portraits of Anthropological Infor­
mants," In the Company of Man.)12 
( ... ] 
The inclusion of Turner's portrait of 
Muchona in The Forest of Symbols may be 
seen as a sign of the times. The Casagrande 
collection in which it originally appeared had 
the effect of segregating the crucial issue of 
relations between ethnographers and their 
indigenous collaborators. Discussion of these 
issues still had no place within scientific ethno­
graphies, but Casagrande's collection shook 
the post-Malinowski professional taboo on 
"privileged informant s." Raymond Firth on Pa 
Fenuatara, Robert Lowie on jim Carpenter ­
a long list of distinguished anthropologists 
have described the indigenous "ethnogra­
phers" with whom they shared, to some 
degree, a distanced, analytic, even ironic view 
of custom. These individuals became valued 
informants because they understood, often 
with real subtlety, what an ethnographic atti­
tude toward culture entailed. In Lowie's quo­
tation of his Crow interpreter {and fellow 
"philologist") Jim Carpenter, one senses a 
shared ouclook: "'When you listen to the old 
men telling about their visions, you've just got 
to believe them" (Casagrande 1960:428). And 
there is considerably more than a wink and a 
nod in the story recounted by Firth about his 
best Tikopian friend and informant: 
On another occasion talk turned to the nets 
ser for salmon trout in the lake. The nets were 
becoming black, possibly with some organic 
growth, and tended ro rot easily. Pa Fenuatara 
then told a story to the crowd assembled in 
the house about how, out on the lake with his 
nets one rime, he felt a spirit going among the 
net and making it soft. When he held the ner 
up he found it slimy. The spirit had been at 
work. I asked him then if this was a tradi­
tional piece of knowledge that spirits were 
responsible for the deterioration of the nets. 
He answered, "No, my own thought." Then 
he added with a laugh, "My own piece of tra­
ditional knowledge." (Casagrande 1960: 
17-18) 
The full methodological ampact of 
Casagrande's collection remains latent, espe-cially the significance of its accounts for 
the dialogical production of ethnographic 
texts and interpretations. This significance is 
obscured by a tendency to cast the book as a 
universalizing, humanist document revealing 
"'a hall of mirrors ... in full variety the endless 
reflected image of man'' (Casagrande 1960: 
xii). In light of the present crisis in ethno­
graphic authority, however, these revealing 
portraits spill into the oeuvres of their 
authors, altering the way they can be read. If 
ethnography is part of what Roy Wagner 
(1980) calls "the invention of culture," its 
activity is plural and beyond the control of any 
individuaL 
One increasingly common way to manifest the 
collaborative production of ethnographic 
knowledge is to quote regularly and at length 
from informants. (A striking example is We 
Eat the Mines, the Mines Eat Us [1979] by 
June Nash.) But such a tactic only begins to 
break up monophonic authority. Quotations 
are always staged by the quoter and tend to 
serve merely as examples or confirming testi­
monies. Looking beyond quotation, one might 
imagine a more radical polyphony that would 
"do the natives and the ethnographer in dif­
ferent voices"; but this too would only displace 
ethnographic authority, still confirming the 
final virtuoso orchestration by a single author 
of all the discourses in his or her text. In this 
sense Bakhtin's polyphony , too narrowly iden­
tified with the novel, is a domesticated het­
eroglossia. Ethnographic discourses are not, in 
any event, the speeches of invented characters. 
Informants are specific individuals with real 
proper names -names that can be cited, in 
altered form when tact requires. Informan ts' 
intentions are overdetermined, their words 
politically and metaphorically complex. If 
accorded an autonomous textual space, tran­
scribed at sufficient length, indigenous state­
ments make sense in terms different from those 
of the arranging ethnographer . Ethnography is 
invaded by heterogloss ia. 
This possibility suggests an alternate textual 
strategy, a utopia of plural authorship that 
accords to collaborators not merely the status 
of independent enunciators but that of writers. 
As a form of authority it must still be consid­
ered utopian for two reasons. First, the few 

ON ETHNOGRAPHIC AUTHORITY 491 
recent experiments with multiple-author 
works appear to require, as an instigating 
force, the research interest of an ethnographer 
who in the end assumes an executive, editor­
ial position. The authoritative stance of 
"giving voice" to the other is not fully tran­
scended. Second, the very idea of plural 
authorship challenges a deep Western identifi­
cation of any text's order with the intention of 
a single author. If this identification was less 
strong when Lafitau wrote his Moeurs des 
sauvages ameriquains, and if recent criticism 
has thrown it into question, it is still a potent 
constraint on ethnographic writing. Nonethe­
less, there are signs of movement in this 
domain. Anthropologists will increasingly 
have to share their texts, and sometimes their 
title pages, with those indigenous collabora­
tors for whom the term informants is no longer 
adequate, if it ever was. 
Ralph Bulmer and Ian Majnep's Birds of My 
Kalam Country ( 1977) is an important proto­
type. (Separate typefaces distinguish the juxta­
posed contributions of ethnographer and New 
Guinean, collaborators for more than a 
decade.) Even more significant is the collec­
tively produced 1974 study Piman Shamanism 
and Staying Sickness (Ka:cim Mumkidag), 
which lists on its title page, without distinction 
(though not, it may be noted, in alphabetical 
order): Donald M. Bahr, anthropologist; Juan 
Gregorio, shaman; David I. Lopez, interpreter; 
and Albert Alvarez, editor. Three of the four 
are Papago Indians, and the book is con­
sciously designed "to transfer to a shaman as 
many as possible of the functions normally 
associated with authorship. These include the 
selection of an expository style, the duty to 
make interpretations and explanations, and 
the right to judge which things are important 
and which are not" (p. 7}. Bahr, the initiator 
and organizer of the project, opts to share 
authority as much as possible. Gregorio, the 
shaman, appears as the principal source of the 
"theory of disease" that is transcribed and 
translated, at two separate levels, by Lopez 
and Alvarez. Gregorio's vernacular texts 
include compressed, often gnomic explana­
tions, which are themselves interpreted and 
contextualized by Bahr's separate commentary. 
The book is unusual in its textual enactment 
of the interpretation of interpretations. In Piman Shamanism the transmon from 
individual enunciations to cultural generaliza­
tions is always visible in the separation of Gre­
gorio's and Bahr's voices. The authority of 
Lopez, less visible, is akin to that of Windson 
Kashinakaji in Turner's work. His bilingual 
fluency guides Bahr through the subtleties of 
Gregorio's language, thus permitting the 
shaman "to speak at length on theoretical 
topics." Neither Lopez nor Alvarez appears as 
a specific voice in the text, and their contribu­
tion to the ethnography remains largely invis­
ible to all bur qualified Papagos, able to gauge 
the accuracy of the translated texts and the 
vernacular nuance of Bahr's interpretations. 
Alvarez' authority inheres in the fact that 
Piman Shamanism is a book directed at sepa­
rate audiences. For most readers focusing on 
the translations and explanations the texts 
printed in Piman will be of little or no inter­
est. The linguist Alvarez, however, corrected 
the transcriptions and translations with an eye 
to their use in language teaching, usmg an 
orthography he had developed for that 
purpose. Thus the book contributes to the 
Papagos' literary invention of their culture. 
This different reading, built into Piman 
Shamanism, is of more than local significance. 
It is intrinsic to the breakup of monolog�eal 
authority that ethnographies no longer address 
a single general type of reader. The multi­
plication of possible readings reflects the fact 
that "ethnographic" consciousness can no 
longer be seen as the monopoly of certain 
Western cultures and social classes. Even in 
ethnographies lacking vernacular texts, indige­
nous readers will decode differently the textu­
alized interpretations and lore. Polyphonic 
works are particularly open to readings not 
specifically intended. Trobriand readers may 
find Malinowski's interpretations tiresome but 
his examples and extended transcriptions still 
evocative. Ndembu will not gloss as quickly as 
European readers over the different votces 
embedded in Turner's works.

The textual embodiment of authority is a 
recurring problem for contemporary experi­
ments in ethnography.13 An older, realist mode

the Western Pacific and based on the con­
struction of a cultural tableau vivant designed 

492 JAMES CLIFFORD 
to be seen from a single vantage point, that of 
the writer and reader -can now be identified 
as only one possible paradigm for authority. 
Political and epistemological assumptions are 
built into this and other styles, assumptions the 
ethnographic writer can no longer afford to 
ignore. The modes of authority reviewed here 
-experiential, interpretive, dialogical, poly­
phonic -are available to all writers of ethno­
graphic texts, Western and non Western. None 
is obsolete, none pure: there is room for inven­
tion within each paradigm. We have seen how 
new approaches tend to rediscover discarded 
practices. Polyphonic authority looks with 
renewed sympathy to compendiums of ver­
nacular texts -expository forms distinct from 
the focused monograph tied to participant 
observation. Now that naive claims to the authority of experience have been subjected to 
hermeneutic suspicion, we may anticipate a 
renewed attention to the subtle interplay of 
personal and disciplinary components in 
ethnographic research. 
Experiential, interpretive, dialogical, and 
polyphonic processes are at work, discor­
dantly, in any ethnography , but coherent pre­
sentation presupposes a controlling mode of 
authority. I have argued that this imposition of 
coherence on an unruly textual process is now 
inescapably a matter of strategic choice. I have 
tried to distinguish important styles of author­
ity as they have become visible in recent 
decades. If ethnographic writing is alive, as I 
believe it is, it is struggling within and against 
these possibilities. 

Part X 
Fictive Fieldwork and 
Fieldwork Novels 
] effrey A. Sluka 
If the dual nature of anthropology-an art and a science, a humanistic science-is 
accepted, there is no reason why each cannot be expanded. The inherent ambiguities 
of this approach are only a reflection of those which exist in life itself. 
-Powdermaker 1966:306 
Some anthropologists have been exploring literary styles to transmit their fieldwork 
experiences, thus blurring the boundaries between experience, impression, and 
emotion. Others have turned to poetry, experimental writing, and fiction to make 
readers share in the ethnographic encounter which makes fieldwork such a singu­
lar experience. In the final part of this anthology, we present chapters selected from 
three partially fictionalized accounts of fieldwork written by anthropologists, all of 
them great publishin g successes: Elenore Smith Bowen's Return to Laughter ( 1964) 
is a fictionalized account of real fieldwork presented as an "anthropological novel," 
and Carlos Castaneda' s The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge 
(1968) and Florinda Donner's Shabono: A Visit to a Retnote and Magical World in 
the South American Rainforest ( 1982) are generally regarded as fictionalized 
accounts of fieldwork presented as "real" ethnographies. 
In the introduction to this anthology, we stressed the dual nature of ethnographic 
fieldwork as both an art and a science. Particularly since the 1980s, ethnography 
and fiction have been juxtaposed in a number of theoretical areas, such as the lit­
erary and postmodern interest in ethnography as a form of literature. Ethnographic 
fiction ties in with the humanist tradition in anthropolo gy, and with alternative and 
experimental forms of ethnographic writing. Even though ethnographic fiction has 
been ignored and hidden by anthropologists who felt it was inappropriate for 
consideration as ethnography , there is, in fact, a long and well-established tradition 
of anthropologists writing fiction informed by their research and fieldwork 
experiences. 
In "Ethnography and Fiction: Where is the Border?," Kirin Narayan (1999) pre­
sents a history of anthropologists writing fiction, and argues that the border between 
ethnography and fiction is "gradual and shifting" (1999:143) and allows for 

494 PART X: FICTIVE FIELDWORK AND FIELDWORK NOVELS 
"mindful border crossings" that may enrich both genres (1999:134). Narayan 
reveals that there has been "a mostly hidden lineage of anthropo logists who write 
both ethnography and fiction" (1999:135) that dates back to the nineteenth century, 
including the following ethnographic novels written by anthropolo gists, based on 
their fieldwork (1999:136): 
• 1890, Adolph Bandelier 's The Delight Makers. 
• 1922, Elsie Clews Parsons' edited volume of stories American Indian Life, which 
included short stories from established anthropologists of the day including 
Franz Boas, Robert Lowie, Edward Sapir, and Paul Radin. 
• 1929, Oliver La Farge's Pulitzer Prize-winning Laughing Boy. 
• 1934, Zora Neald Hurston's ]onah,s Gourd Vine. 
• 1936, D'Arcy McNickle' s The Surrot1nded. 
• 1940s, Ella Deloria' s Water/illy (not published until 19 8 8). 
• 1954, Laura Bohannan's Return to Laughter (published in 1964, under the 
pseudonym Elenore Smith Bowen). 
• 1960s, Carter Wilson's Crazy February (published in 1974). 
• 1969, Carlos Castaneda' s The Teachings of Don juan: A Yaqui Way of 
Knowledge. 
Narayan (1999:136) observes that as a result of the growth of experimentation in 
forms of ethnographic writing since the 1970s, a number of anthropolo gists have 
now openly turned to fiction, including Michael Jackson (1986), Timothy Knabb 
(1995), Richard and Sally Price (1994), John Stewart (1989), and Margery Wolf 
( 1992). 
The practice of anthropolo gists writing fiction is not only alive and well but 
appears to be thriving. It is particularly supported by the Society for Humanis t 
Anthropol ogy, and seen in articles published in their journal Anthropology and 
Humanism and the annual fiction awards they present. An illustrative example is 
Colleen Springwater's "The Stories of Red Clay: Man of the Mesa" (1995), in which 
she artfully tells four stories as an alternative model for the presentation of infor­
mant accounts. Four "true" stories told to her by a Native American informant 
reemerge as "fiction" in the ethnographer 's retelling, in a style Springwater terms 
"anthropoetry" (1995:193). That this interest in exploring the boundaries between 
ethnography and fiction is growing was also demonst rated in the April, 2005 issue 
of the Anthropology Newsletter, which published a list of texts by anthropol ogists 
who have "ventured beyond the conventional scholarly journal article or mono­
graph" (Gottlieb 2005:27), including fictionalized ethnographies and ethnographi­
cally grounded novels, plays, poetry, comic strips, graphic novels, biographies, 
memoirs, childrearing manuals, and even murder mysteries. 
For those anthropologists who prefer to think of fieldwork strictly as a formal 
scientific method of investigation, developments along these lines are frivolous and 
possibly damaging to the academic authority of the discipline. In the 1960s, such 
skepticism compelled Laura Bohannan to use the nom de plume Elenore Smith 
Bowen in place of her own name, as the author of her highly successful "anthro­
pological novel" Return to Laughter (1964 ). But fieldwork is far more than just a 
method; the very idea or image of "fieldwork" has entered the popular imagina­
tion, and shows up outside of academia in many forms of popular culture and as 
a trope in many forms of popular media. While the "romance" of fieldwork is more 

INTRODUCTION 495 
a popular than scientific perception, this trope has been increasingly exploited by 
writers, filmmakers, and other artists. 
Today, writers with no background in anthropology write books, plays, short 
stories, and films with anthropologists in them, frequently focusing on fieldwork 
experiences. For example, while Susanna Kaysen is not a trained anthropologist, in 
her novel Far Afield (1990) she nonetheless seems to achieve what Bohannan, Cas­
taneda, and Donner are all acclaimed for -conveying both ethnographic insights 
about the people and culture involved and what fieldwork is "really" like, through 
a fictionalized account. But in this case, it is entirely fiction, and not based on pro­
fessional anthropological training or fieldwork experience. Far Afield is described 
as an "anthropological novel," set on the remote Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic, 
where an anthropology graduate student has arrived to do PhD fieldwork. Kaysen 
is an accomplished novelist who employs a reflexive trope; she turns her powers of 
observation on observation itself -who is the observer and who the observed? 
Humorous and poignant, the novel evokes the complexities of the ethnographic 
encounter , and applies many of the key tropes of narrative reflexive ethnography -
culture shock on first arrival, suspicion that the anthropologist might be a CIA 
agent, establishing and maintaining rapport, competition with other anthropologists 
who do research on the island, adapting to alien local customs and cuisine, an affair 
with a woman the locals want him to marry, the threat of "going native," and, 
finally, the pain and exhilaration of withdrawal from the field. 
The Anthropology Newsletter has published lists of popular films featuring 
anthropologist characters, who are nearly always identified with their (usually 
exotic) fieldwork. For example, Nomads (1986)-one of my favorites - a "psychic 
thriller" about a cultural anthropologist haunted by "evil Eskimo spirits," directed 
by John McTiernan, which provided the blueprint for his later Hollywood block­
busters Predator, Die Hard, and The Last Action Hero. Leading cartoonists, such 
as Gary Larson, and Garry Trudeau, whose Doonesbury cartoon, unfortunately 
associating anthropological fieldwork with counterinsur gency, appears in the intro­
duction to Part VI, have also presented images of anthropologists in their work. 
In 1964, Laura Bohannan, renowned in the discipline for her work with the Tiv 
of Northern Nigeria, pseudonymously published Return to Laughter: An Anthro­
pological Novel. Based on her real experiences, the book presented a fictionalized 
account of fieldwork with an African tribe, which was a pastiche composed of the 
stories of several people and numerous field trips. Because at that time fieldwork 
experiences were not yet an acceptable topic for anthropologists to write about, 
Bohannan felt it necessary to publish the book under a pseudonym in order to detach 
the mistakes, problems, and embarrassments recounted in the "novel'' from the sci­
entific monograph based on her fieldwork in Nigeria. Despite the literary license 
used, the book succeeded in both providing ethnogra phic insights into the indi­
genous culture of West Africa, and conveying what fieldwork may be like better 
than many of the later reflexive, nonfictionalized accounts. 
In The Teachings of Don Juan, the first of five don Juan books he wrote, Carlos 
Castaneda describes his experience of becoming a "sorcerer's apprentice" to a Yaqui 
shaman while an anthropology postgraduate student at UCLA. Before he died in 
1998, Castaneda wrote ten books in all; he had millions of followers, and his books 
continue to sell in 17 languages. In his foreword to the book, Walter Goldschmidt 
observes : 

496 PART X: FICTIVE FIELDWORK AND FIELDWORK NOVELS 
Thjs book is both ethnography and allegory. Carlos Castaneda, under the tutelage of 
don Juan, takes us ... into a world not merely other than our own, but of an entirely 
different order of reality ... The central importance of entering into worlds other than 
our own -and hence of anthropolo gy itself -lies in the fact that the experience leads 
us to understand that our own world is also a cultural construct. By experiencing other 
worlds, then, we see our own for what it is ... Hence the allegory, as well as the ethnog­
raphy ... In this work he demonstrates the essential skill of good ethnography -the 
capacity to enter into an alien world. (1968:vii-viii). 
While Castaneda always maintained that all his experiences were real rather than 
allegorical, his critics concluded that his don Juan books were a hoax, and that don 
Juan himself probably never existed. The definitive account of the controversy sur­
rounding the veracity of Castaneda' s books is The Don Juan Papers: Further Cas­
taneda Controversies, edited by Richard de Mille. Published in 1980, it includes 49 
articles looking at the authenticity and contribution of Castaneda's books, and con­
cludes that, in the tradition of the Piltdown forgery, Castaneda was one of the great 
intellectual hoaxers of all time. It includes an "alleglossary" with 200 passages, 
commonly found in libraries, which furnish certain or likely origins of don Juan's 
teachings and Carlos' adventures, but also thoroughly examines the positive con­
tributions these books nonetheless have made. For example, de Mille looks at how 
Castaneda functioned as a "trickster-teacher," a deceptive truth-bringer who 
brought a new concept of "reality" to millions of readers. 
Florinda Donner' s Shabono (1982) is presented as a personal account of the expe­
riences of an anthropology graduate student doing fieldwork with the lticoteri, a 
kinship group of the Yanomamo, in Venezuela. The bioblurb at the front identifies 
Donner as "an anthropologist currently working on her doctoral dissertation based 
on fieldwork on non-Western healing practices in Venezuela. She has done exten­
sive work among shamans in Sonora and Oaxaca, Mexico as well as in Venezuela.,, 
Controversy about the book broke out in 1983, when the American Anthropolo­
gist published an article accusing Donner of plagiarism and fraud. Rebecca De 
Holmes wrote: "I find it hard to believe that Donner spent any length of time with 
the Yanomamo," and suggested that Donner's ethnographic data were "rather 
expertly borrowed from other sources and assembled in a kind of melange of fact 
and fantasy for which Castaneda is so famous" (1983:665). De Holmes suggested 
that much of Donner's "borrowing" was outright plagiarism from another book, a 
captivity narrative titled Yanoama: The Narrative of a White Girl Kidnapped by 
Amaz_onian Indians, written by Helena Valero (1970). De I-I,olmes supported her 
accusation by presenting a series of sample passages from the two books, and a list 
of identical time sequences. However, in the same issue of American Anthropolo­
gist, Debra Pichi ( 1983) concluded that the book is in fact an authentic ethnogra­
phy of the Yanomamo, based on 12 months of fieldwork, but reconstructed from 
memory and secondary sources because Donner destroyed her notes while in the 
field. 
In the debate which followed, questions arose as to whether the whole book was 
a fabrication and whether Donner ever lived with the Yanomamo at all, and it cen­
tered on the issue of whether the book was "true" or "false." One consequence of 
this debate was a heightened recognition that it is possible, given good secondary 
material, to construct a convincing and ethnogra phically accurate account of life in 

INTROD UCTION 497 
another culture without having actually conducted fieldwork there. Of course, this 
had already been demonstrated by Ruth Benedict's highly successful ethnography 
of the society and culture of Japan, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword (1946); 
Benedict had no direct experience of Japan, and relied solely on secondhand sources. 
Mary Louise Pratt (1986) has discussed the controversy generated by Castaneda' s 
and Donner's books, asking if they are really ethnographies. While both claim to 
be "real" ethnographies by "real" anthropolo gists, they have been revealed to essen­
tially be ethnographically informed fiction or literature. With regard to Shabono, 
Pratt concluded: 
What Donner did was write an infuriatingly ambiguous book, which may or may not 
be "true," is and is not ethnography , is and is not autobiography, does and does not 
claim professional and academic authority, is and is not based on fieldwork, and so 
on. An ungrateful apprentice can do no worse than this. For if Florinda Donner did 
fabricate much of her story (as she may have), she has disgraced the profession by 
lying, and lying so well no one could tell. If she did not fabricate her story, she scored 
one of the anthropological scoops of the century. (19 86:31) 
Regardless of the question of veracity, Pratt argues that anthropo logists have much 
to gain from writing outside the discursive traditions that preceded them, because 
this has the potential to change or enrich the repertoire of ethnographic writing. 
She argues that once we recognize the writing conventions and tropes we use "it 
becomes possible, if one wishes, to liberate oneself from them, not by doing away 
with tropes (which is not possible) but by appropriating and inventing new ones 
(which is)" (1986:49-50). 
Like Kenneth Good, discussed in the introduction to this reader, Donner was 
rumored to have "gone native." She married an Iticoteri chief, and the cover blurb 
describes a classic "gone-native" scenario: 
Normal practice for anthropologists is to remain as detached as possible from the soci­
eties in which they do their fieldwork. Objectivity is held to be at risk where an anthro­
pologist becomes personally involved with the people under observation. When 
Florinda Donner went deep into the jungle between Venezuela and Brazil, she took her 
notebooks with her, and her camera. But soon these were discarded, along with her 
Western clothes. For Ms Donner was learning to live as an Indian: adopted by a native 
couple in the village, or shabono, of the lticoteri, she began to go beyond observation, 
and to absorb their totems and taboos as her own. 
It is perhaps ironic that the back cover blurb also presents supportive quotes from 
Carlos Castaneda, who describes it as a "masterpiece" and "superb social science," 
and a quote from Newsweek stating that the book "Has the vividness of good 
fiction." 
Narayan has argued that crossings between ethnogra phy and fiction -such as 
those presented in this part of the anthology -have been "mutually enriching'' for 
both genres ( 1999:143 ). There is debate about whether this "creative nonfiction" 
strays too far from fact into the realm of fiction, and about the ethics of injecting 
fictional inventions within works labeled '�ethnograp hy," "memoir," or '•non­
fiction." But on the positive side, "accessibly written ethnographies and novels 
drawing on ethnographically honed insights have the potential to bring the prac-

498 PART X: FICTIVE FIELDWORK AND FIELDWORK NOVELS 
tices of our discipline to wider audiences. In a globalized world of many crosscut­
ting, transcultural conversations, to reach audiences beyond our disciplinary 
purview is to enhance anthropolog y's relevance" (1999:144). 
While there appears to be great promise in the development of "alternative" forms 
of ethnography that blend fact and fiction, it seems to us that honesty is the central 
issue. Anthropolo gists have a responsibility to make it clear what their work is based 
on, how it has been constructed, what the sources of data or knowled ge are, and 
whether it is partly fictionalized or not.
