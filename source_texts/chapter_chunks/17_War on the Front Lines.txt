War on the Front Lines 
Carolyn Nordstrom 
War is perhaps impossible: it continues nonetheless everywhere you look. 
Munapeo 
As I wandered up into the town of Munapeo1 
from the dirt strip that served as a runway, I 
noticed the voids in the landscape of village 
life: the lack of houses and fields -razed, 
burned, or destroyed. The lack of social flow 
-well-worn paths empty of men returning 
from farm plots, women carrying water home, 
children running in endless games. 
It was my first visit to Munapeo, but in the 
year I had just spent in Mozambique, I had 
seen a number of towns in similar straits. 
Munapeo had been held by the rebel group 
Renamo -responsible for the instigation of the 
war and the majority of te"or-wa rfare prac­
tices and human rights abusel- -for some 
years. The Frelimo (government) forces had 
recently retaken the town. And the war was 
not far: gunshots and shouts from Renamo 
forces could be heard less than a kilometer 
away. 
The sense of eerie abandonment gave way in 
the town center to an all too common scenario 
in war-torn Mozambique. Hundreds of people 
sat, slept, and worked in a clump of human­
ity, eschewing the few remaining bombed-out 
buildings in favor of makeshift tents. A limited Sylvere Lotringer ( 1987) 
supply of emergency foodstuffs, flown in on 
the cargo plane I had hopped a ride with, were 
being distributed to a surprisingly orderly line. 
The plane brought food but not cooking pots 
or ftlel, and the ingenious tried to figure out 
ways to cook their grains in a town long since 
plundered for its goods and wood. 
The battle-wise and violence-weary knew 
that food did not bring peace: a concentration 
of troops brought a concentration of (starving) 
civilians, which prompted the delivery of em­
ergency resources, which then provoked 
renewed Renamo attacks seeking to loot the 
supplies. The war rolls over the town again. 
Behind these scenes - the hungry and starv­
ing sprawled in the dust and the sun, the 
bombed-out buildings sporting military graf­
fiti, the wild eyes and careless ranting of 
someone who "has just seen too much war" -
are a host of further tragic realities. Some 
stories I never got used to: I sat listening 
incredulously as a soldier explained to me a 
typical fact of life: 
Renamo comes into town and some soldiers 
enter a hut and grab the womarz and begin to 
rape her. Another soldier forces her husba11d 
to stand close by and look on. Usually these 
husbands do -they are so afraid for their

families that they think they should stay mrd 
help in any way they can, attd besides, 
Renamo has threatened them all with their 
lives if they do not do as they are told. The" 
we [Frelimo forces] come into tatun, and if we 
find out about such rapes, we routtd up these 
men. I mean, they must be collaborators (with 
Renamo), for what kit�d of man would sit and 
watch his wife beirtg raped?3 
A mother comes up to me at this point and 
asks me to accompany her. She takes me to a 
shade tree where her son of about four years 
old is quietly sitting, artd she draws back a 
dirty piece of cloth draped over mze shoulder 
and falling to his lap. He has been shot in the 
groin, and the bullet is clearly still inside the 
child. Is there anything I can do? she wants to 
know. I look around at the town -no clinic, 
no medicines, no nurses, no running water. 
Even the indigenous healers cannot get outside 
of town to collect the herbs they need to treat. 
Other than passing out some antibiotics and 
some empty words of hope, there is nothing I 
can do. I sit down next to the child and realize 
he already ktwws. 
These mzd a hundred other stories fill my 
head as I walk to the dirt airstrip to catch a 
ride out with a cargo plane that has come. But 
most of all, I think about the tragic fact that I 
can leave. The inhabitants of Munapeo cannot. 
In the contest for towns and the quest for secu­
rity, both sides use the civilian population .. strategically. " When the control of a town 
shifts hands from one set of troops to another, 
and when the ability of the troops to hold that 
area is questionable, civilians are often gath­
ered together around a troop base. Theoreti­
cally, this is for security: "unprotected" 
civilians provide easy labor sources or targets 
for vindictive enemy troops convinced they are 
supporters of the ''other side." But, in fact, 
forced relocation provided troops with easily 
guarded populations who provided not only 
supplies and labor for the troops but also a 
buffer zone between the troops and the enemy. 
In case of an attack, it is the civilians who 
provide a wall of security. Because they were 
often forbidden to leave the immediate area, 
this meant that many were unable to attend 
their farms, and starvation often set in at an 
alanning rate. Entire communities were 
known to die off in this way. It is less than a kilometer to the dirt runway, 
but no civilians are this far from the town 
center. I am reminded how close the war is for 
them whe11 Re11amo soldiers i11 the bush shoot 
at the plane as the pilot tries to land, some­
thing he is completely unaware of because he 
is landing to a rousing chorus of Aerosmith in 
his earphones. I think wryly back to the secu­
rity clearance report I got before leaving for 
Mtmapeo: "No problem, safe and secure for 
travel ... 
When we touch down at the provincial 
capital, I glance to see if the two Russian twin 
turbine combat helicopters stationed there are 
in. One has "In God We Trust" painted on the 
side over a picture of an American dollar bill, 
and the other is emblazoned with the wings 
emblem from Paul McCartney's first album 
with his band, Wings. 
After more than a year in Mozambique, I was 
used to days such as this. The layers of con­
ceptual havoc that surround the war had 
become, in a curious way, a fact of life-almost 
comfortable in an off-balanced manner. It was 
not always that way. When 1 first arrived, I was 
frequently assailed by what appeared to be 
sheer chaos. Uninitiated into reading between 
the lines, I could not figure out why security 
reports did not match security realities. I was 
philosophically stalled by listening to a man 
sympathize with a person for having to watch 
his wife being raped by enemy soldiers and 
then targeting him as an enemy for having let 
this occur. I had no framework with which to 
deal with a culturally constructed image of war 
(soldiers on a battlefield) that in reality turned 
out to be a four-year-old sitting silently under 
a tree knowing with an uncanny wisdom that 
he would probably die from a gunshot wound 
in his groin. 
In this chapter I explore the three interre­
lated themes of chaos, Peasan (or what 
Feldman has said may effectively be called a 
crisis of reason), and creativity. Chaos 
abounds in war and in fact may be called one 
of its defining characteristics. It exists as both 
strategy and effect and permeates the entire 
war enterprise from perpetrators to victims. 
War, expanding on Elaine Scarry (1985), 
"unmakes" worlds, both real and conceptual. 
Both studying and writing about war call into 

WAR ON THE FRONT LINES 247 
question some of our enduring notions of 
reason. But what may be the most powerful 
aspect of studying war is not merely the decon­
structive violence that attends to it but the cre­
ativity the people on the front lines employ to 
reconstruct their shattered worlds. 
Chaos and Camus's Absurdity 
A world that can be explained even with 
bad reasons is a familiar world. But, on the 
other hand, in a universe suddenly divested 
of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a 
stranger. His exile is without remedy since 
he is deprived of the memory of a lost home 
or the hope of a promised land. This 
divorce between man and his life, the actor 
and his setting, is properly the feeling of 
absurdity. (Camus 1955:5}"' 
In considering the many towns like 
Munapeo I observed during my year and a half 
of fieldwork in Mozambique, I found that 
understa nding the war does not rest on the fact 
that the war begins to make any more sense as 
time goes on but that, as Mozambicans 
showed me, we begin to accept the existence 
of senselessness. As a Mozambican explained 
to me, reminiscent of Camus: 
Do you know why, u;hen you meet a phantom 
on the road, you do not pass it by mtd look 
at it? Do you know what is so dangerously 
bewitching, so lethal, about looking? It is 
because if you turn around and look behind 
the phantom, you tvi/1 discover him to be 
hollow. This war, it is a lot like that fJhantom. 
For the vast majority of Mozambicans, war 
is about existing in a world suddenly divested 
of lights. It is about a type of violence that 
spills out across the country and into the daily 
lives of people to undermine the world as they 
know it. A violence that, in severing people 
from their traditions and their futures, severs 
them from their lives. It hits at the heart of per­
ception and existence. And that is, of course, 
the goal of terror warfare: to cripple political 
will by attempting to cripple all will, all sense. 
To understand the war in Mozambique is to 
multiply the small vignette of Munapeo a thousandfold. But to understand Munapeo is 
not to understand the war. For each person's 
experience of the war is unique, and the char­
acteristics of the war -the form the conflict 
takes-varies from village to village, district to 
province. I could as easily have begun this 
chapter with the story of the town I saw that 
was completely burned to the ground, all its 
inhabitants gone, no one knew where. No one 
knew where, because no one officially knew 
the town was destroyed. When I returned to 
the provincial capital and later to the country's 
capital, I inquired about the fate of this town. 
No one had even heard it had been burned out. 
With a war that has affected one-half of the 
entire country's population, it is hard to keep 
track of every casualty, including entire towns. 
I could also have started this chapter with 
the story of any of the hundreds of thousands 
who have been maimed, displaced, or kid­
napped. Stories such as the following are 
legion in Mozambique. These were the words 
of a person I spoke with the day after he 
emerged from the bush after having escaped 
from Renamo: 
\Ve were under Renamo control for several 
years. They came in and took everything. 
includi11g us. \Ve were forced to move around 
a lot, carrying heavy loads for Renamo here, 
being pushed there for no appare11t reaso11. 
People died, fJeople were killed, people were 
hurt, cut, assaulted, beaten ... there was no 
medicine, no doctors, no food to help them. 
My family is gone, all of them. Only I am here. 
But the violence and the killing is not neces­
sarily the worst of it. \\forst of all1s the endless 
hunger, the forced marches, the homelessness 
... day in and day out a meager, hurting exis­
tence that seems to stretch 011 forever. 
The level of violence in this man's story is 
considered "normal" in the war. True horror 
is reserved for stories that combine unbeliev­
able brutality with sheer senselessness. 
The Bandidos Armadas fArmed Bandits: 
Re11amoj came into our toum. They rounded 
all of us up who had not been killed in the 
initial attack and brought tts to the center of 
the village. They took my son, and they cut 
him up, they killed him, and tlu'Y put pieces 
of him in a large fJot a11d cooked him. The11 
they forced me to eat some of this. I dtd it, I 
did not k11ow what else to do. 

248 CAROLYN NORDSTROM 
The formation of Renamo and the war helps 
to explain the inordinate amount of terror 
warfare that has characterized this war. 
Mozambi que's "internal" war was developed 
and guided externally. The war began when 
Frelimo (Frente de Liberta�ao de Mo�am­
bique) came to power in Mozambique after the 
country achieved independence from Portugal 
in 1975. Proapartheid governments, first 
Rhodesia and then South Africa, formed and 
led the rebel group Renamo (Resistencia 
Nacional Mo�ambicana) in an attempt to 
undermine the model and assistance that a 
successful black -rna jority Marxist- Leninist 
country offered to the resistance fighters of 
rheir counrries. While pro-Renamo supporters 
and opportunists do exist within Mozam­
bique, essentially the rebel soldiers functioned 
with little popular support. Because destabi­
lization, not coherent political ideology, was 
the defining factor in Rename' s formation, 
dirty war tactics -those using terror tactics in · 
the targeting of civilian populations -pre­
dominate. The human rights violations have 
been recognized as being among the worst in 
the world.5 
The extent of the violence in Mozambique 
can be captured in a few statistics. Over one 
million people, the vast majority noncombat­
ants, have lost their lives to the war. Over 
two hundred thousand children have been 
orphaned by the war (some estimates are much 
higher). Adequate assistance is more hope than 
reality in a country where one-third of all 
schools and hospitals were closed or destroyed 
by Renamo and where a single orphanage 
operates. Nearly one-fourth of the entire pop­
ulation of 15 million people has been displaced 
from their homes by the war, and an additional 
one-fourth of the population has been directly 
affected by the war. In a country where 90 
percent of the population lives in poverty and 
60 percent in extreme poverty, the toll has 
been devastating. 
These stories of war, individually and col­
lectively , are distinctly Mozambican. It is their 
Lives, their suffering, their courage, that is on 
the line. But the war itself is not uniquely 
Mozambican. In addition to the founding role 
played by Rhodesia and then South Africa, dis­
affected Portuguese former colonialis ts have 
played a critical role in Renamo' s war. As well, Renamo has been aided by numerous Western 
right-wing organizations and religious groups 
and assisted by Western military advisers, arms 
merchants, and mercenaries -placing the war, 
and its defining strategies, squarely in an 
international political, economic, and military 
network. The strategies used in Mozambique 
have been applied in scores of other wars 
around the globe, carried through the same 
international network by the same interna­
tional cast in search of power and gain 
(Nordstrom 1994a, 1994b). 
This international entanglement of alliances, 
antipathies, and mercenaries allows the trans­
fer of fundamental strategic orientations and 
specific tactical practices from group to group 
across international and political boundari es. 
Transferred with these are the cultural belief 
systems: beliefs about what are deemed accept­
able, and necessary, processes of war, violence, 
and control in the quest for power. These wars, 
which have taken place primarily in non­
Western countries, have focused on the use of 
terror tactics and the targeting of civilians and 
social infrastructure. They carry the legacy of 
a cold war that has itself been given over to 
history. 
To understand what is attacked in a dehu­
manizing war necessitat es an understanding of 
what it is to be human. For Mozambicans, this 
includes, but is certainly not limited to, the 
following. Mozambicans are nurtured in 
the bosom of family, and this is grounded in 
the skills and behaviors that sustain life -
in working, in cultivating, in harvesting, in 
consuming. As family members, they illumi­
nate the nexus of a time/place continuum: the 
fecundity of the ancestors has been instilled in 
them and comes to fruition in the familiar 
landscapes of home, hearth, and the land they 
were born to. They thrive as part of a com­
munity, and a pattern of friendships, obliga­
tions, and shared goals gives tangible 
substance to their sense of world. Mythologi­
cal space landscapes geographic space: ritual, 
ceremony, and belief bring the universal home. 
The eternal, the social, and the collective are 
made apparent through the individual and the 
particular . Cultural process brings "home" the 
nature of reality through the physical form of 
the participant 's everyday world. They sit in 
a gathering place in their communit y, just 

WAR ON THE FRONT LINES 249 
outside their homes, surrounded by their fields 
and animals and belongings, supported by 
their family and acquaint ances, and they peer 
through ceremony's door into the mysteries of 
the universe until they have made sense of it 
and it of them. Their communit y, mythical and 
physical, takes shape in relation to a landscape 
of cultivated and wild spaces, within a 
network of other communities that together 
follow patterns of exchange, of everything 
from people and goods to aggressions and 
innovations. 
The words of a Mozambican woman friend 
of mine poignantly demonstrate the destruc­
tion that the war has brought to millions of 
her compatriots: 
Epah, Carolyn, this war. My youngest son 
came of age not too long ago, and I felt 
obliged to take him back to the land of my 
people to perform the ceremonies that would 
ensure that he grows into a strong and healthy 
member of our family. The journey was a 
heart-stopping one - as you know the roads 
are so unsafe, and we had to walk a majority 
of the way to avoid land mines and rogue sol­
diers. I was so frightened I would lose my son 
before he could even come of age properly. 
But when we arrived in my birth home, it was 
so very disappointing. I remember a house 
filled with the happy shouts of chi.ldren, lush 
farmlands flowing out from its doors, vegeta­
bles to pick for food, and our animals dotting 
the hil/sides. Always a fire with food cooking, 
always a story being told. 
It is so awful to see it now. My mother is 
the only one there now: my father, as you 
know, was killed by Bandidos [Renamoj, my 
grandpa rents just died of the war: not enough 
food, medicines, hope. My mother, she will 
never be the same after all the attacks she has 
lived through, after seeing her husband 
slaughtered. The horror of the violence is 
etched on her face and her soul. The house is 
dark, decrepit and empty. The Bm1didos have 
carried off everything they could in the imzu­
merable times they have come through. The 
fields are destroyed, and my mother refuses to 
replant them, for every time she does, the Ban­
didos come and raid and then burn the fields. 
The animals are long gone, killed by the sol­
diers. The neighbors are few and far between, 
killed off, run off, starved off. No more laugh­
ter, no more stories, no more children. No more home. Even worse, when we arrived 
there, I found it was going to be really diffi­
cult to hold the ceremonies we wanted to for 
our son. The noise and music of the cere­
monies attracts the Bandidos. They hear it 
and come to attack. We cannot even perform 
the ceremonies that make us human. We did 
a ceremony, yes, but a mere skeleton of that 
which tradition calls for. Skeleton, yes, that is 
a good word -we are living skeletons of the 
war. 
With the onslaught of excessive violence, 
the boundaries defining family, communi ty, 
and cosmos slip, grow indistinct, reconfigure 
in new and painful ways. And through the 
breached boundaries, the substance of each 
spills out across the landscapes of life in a way 
that is unstructured, highly charged, and 
immediate. Family has been shattered, not 
only by death and displacement but by the 
impossibility of unresolvables: Is a missing rel­
ative alive? Can I protect those still with me? 
How do we live like a family when that which 
defines family life no longer exists? In its most 
fundamental sense, family is a historical con­
tinuum, and home the place where it unfolds. 
When these are disrupted, the grounding of 
self in time, place, and space is upended. Left 
to a here and now unmoored in time, people 
lose the guidance of tradition, the comfort of 
tomorrow. What then becomes of the person 
severed from time and place? Not the flesh and 
bones body but the intangible and subjective 
effervescence animating personal identity and 
bringing the self to life -that which, all told, 
makes humans human. The world, as many 
Mozambicans sadly said to me, is no longer 
human.6 
When violence reaches this level of severity, 
identity itself suffers, as evinced in the words 
of a dislocado (dislocated: internal refugee) 
in southern Mozambique. As we talked, he 
stood, handmade hoe in hand, surveying the 
dry and barren fields where he and many other 
dislocados had recently arrived to try and eke 
out food and a fragile home. I thought at the 
time I had never seen a face so sculpted by res­
ignation and determination at one and the 
same time. 
We have arrived here from all over, scattered 
victims of Renamo violence. Everyone has 

250 CAROLYN NORDSTROM 
lost everything they had. Their homes were 
burned, their goods stolen, their crops 
destroyed, their family members slaughtered. 
Even those that managed to flee often ran dif­
ferent directions from the rest of their fami­
lies, and today do not know if the rest are 
alive or dead. Many have been through this 
cycle more than once, having fled to a "safe 
area" only to be attacked again. Me, this is 
my third relocation. I do not know where 
most of my family is. Maybe we will be 
attacked yet again -we hear Renamo passing 
by here at night. It is difficult to find the will 
to plant crops and tend children when it may 
all be taken from us tonight, and maybe we 
will not survive this time .... The worst of it 
is the way this attacks our spirits, our very 
selves. Everyone here thinks: Before this I 
knew who I was, I farmed the land that my 
father farmed, and his ancestors before him, 
and this long line nurtured the living. I had 
my family that I fathered, and I had my house 
that I built, and the goods that I had worked 
for. I knew who I was because I had all this 
round me. But now I have nothing, 1 have lost 
what makes me who I am. I am nothing here. 
If people are defined by the world they 
inhabit, and the world is culturally constructed 
by the people who consider themselves a part 
of it, people ultimately control the production 
of reality and their place in it. They produce 
themselves. But they are dependent on these 
productions (Taussig 1993). Should one wish 
to destroy, to control, or to subjugate a people, 
what more powerful "target" could be found 
than that of personhood and reality? To 
destroy the world, encapsulated in the nexus 
of place and person described above, is to 
destroy the self. 
It is my opinion that self, ident ity, and the 
experience of the world are mutually depen­
dent for all people, as contemporary existen­
tial, phenomeno logical and postmodernist 
theory are demonstrating. But this view has 
long permeated African thought. Without 
trying to overgeneralize African epistemol ogy, 
I found many Mozambicans hold a similar 
view to the scholars E. A. Ruch and K. C. 
Anyanwa (1984:86-7).7 
The African culture makes no sharp distinc­
tion between the ego and the world, African 
culture makes the self the center of the world. 
... The world which is centered on the self is personal and alive. Self-experience is not sep­
arated from the experiencing self. The self viv­
ifies or animates the world so that the soul ' 
spirit or mind of the self is also that of the 
world .... What happens so the world happens 
to the self. Self disorder is a metaphysical con­
tagion [italics in original] affecting the whole 
world. 
It would appear to be equally valid to con­
clude that world disorder is a metaphysical 
contagion affecting the whole self. Yet if the 
world makes the self, the self equally makes 
the world, and this is why terror warfare is 
ultimately doomed to fail. As we will see in the 
section on creativity, people have the creative 
wherewithal to re-create the worlds war has 
destroyed. 
Reason 
It is worth noting that the language pecu­
liar to totalitarian doctrines is always an 
academic and administrative language. 
Albert Camus 
Western epistemologies generally try to find 
"The Reason" (universal and specific) for war 
-to fix it in time and understanding. If only 
we could just bring to light the specific struc­
tural, mythological, interpersonal acts of dom­
ination and resistances, war would make 
sense. But these are sweeping analyses, ones 
that all too often leave out the individuals -
living, suffering, dying -who are the war. 
Individuals do not make up a generic group of 
"combatants," "civilians," and "casualties" 
but an endlessly complex set of people and per­
sonalities, each of whom has a unique rela­
tionship to the war and a unique story to tell. 
Based on my field experiences at the front 
lines of wars, I hope to challenge - to draw a 
line through - the epistemologies of Reason, 
with a capital R, as it applies to War. When 
war actually becomes a matter of life and 
death, Reason is replaced with a cacophony of 
realities. One cannot peel back the layers of the 
onion to find the core phenomenon; for, as we 
all know, the onion, like reality, is composed 
only of layers. 
I am reminded of a conversation I had with 
a young teenage soldier in the bush of north-

WAR ON THE FRONT LINES 251 
central Mozambique. I asked him why he was 
fighting, and he looked at me and in all seri­
ousness replied, "I forgot." For this person, 
the tattered clothing he was wearing, the gun 
he carried, the fear and hunger he constantly 
felt, the "endless days and nights of living in 
the remote bush on the run without food, 
shelter, or comfort" were realities. The "why" 
of it all was far less intelligible; unimportant 
even. 
Behind the political ideologies, the military 
strategies, the international arms and ally net­
works that support the war effort, and the 
commanders that channel this down to the 
front lines, "I forgot" can exist, the core of 
the phenomena. 
The problems that surround reason do not 
pertain exclusively to war. The whole notion 
of reason as it has been defined in Enlighten­
ment philosophy is in crisis. Epistemolo gy can 
no longer conveniently be separated from 
ontology, word from act and concept, subject 
from object, reality from construction. This 
crisis extends to the heart of theory. For, ulti­
mately, we as theoreticians live our reason. We 
cannot step outside of it to assess it in any final 
sense. We are, as Allen Feldman ( 1991) points 
out, inescapably implicated in our reasoning 
about reason. This is nowhere more evident 
than when we begin to try to ''make sense" of 
the cacophonous flow of our field observations 
-to wrench word from experience. 
Terror warfare, such as that defining 
Renamo' s in Mozambique, seeks to sever 
all relationships grounding personhood to 
enforce complete political acquiescence. But, 
too, our theories are all too often abstracted ­
and sever personhood from narrative and text. 
In Western epistemol ogy, we have a legacy of 
thinking about violence as a concept, a phe­
nomenon, a "thing." We reify it, we "thing­
ify" it, as Michael Taussig (1987) cautions, 
rather than recognize it as experiential and 
rendering it real. This approach stands in 
sharp contrast to the Mozambican' s view of 
violence - a view that sees violence as fluid, as 
something that people can both make and 
unmake. 
A concern with the reasons of war comes 
dangerously close to a concern with making 
war reasonable -which, of course, is a goal of 
the Enlightenment process. Maybe this search 
for reason has allowed us to "explain war away": concretized in theory, set in fact, dis­
tanced to a comfortable vantage point. I 
suggest we consider the fact that this search for 
the "reason" for war actually silences the 
reality of war. 
In her study of torture, Scarry (1985) has 
noted that pain unmakes the world of the 
victim. Expanding on Scarry, I (Nordstrom 
1992a, 1992b) have suggested that war's vio­
lence unmakes the world at large both for 
those who experience it and for those who 
witness it. Violence deconstructs reason. The 
question then arises, Does writing and reading 
about violence unmake the world? Is this 
why so many of our theories on violence are 
modernist, clear concrete categories distanced 
from the raw experiences they purport to 
explain? 
Another paradox may lie at the core of this 
question about "writing" violence in theory. 
How can we write about the "unmaking" and 
"creating" of the world in a .. made" world of 
academic prose? No matter how representative 
we try to be, theory and literature have a struc­
ture and an order that they impose in and of 
themselves, always once removed from experi­
ence, intolerant of chaos. As Jean Baudrillard 
(1987:133) succinctly points out, "Theory is 
simulation.'' 
Theories about violence will always struggle 
with these issues of representation. Violence is 
an unsettling topic. It raises piercing questions 
of human nature, social in/justice and cultural 
viability -and about our personal account­
ability and responsibility in the face of these. 
It challenges cherished notions of a just world 
and throws into stark relief the sheer daunting 
complexities of human and cultural reality. It 
utters the unutterable. 
And the Anthropologist? 
Lived experience overflows the boundaries 
of any one concept, and one person, or any 
one society. 
Michael Jackson ( 1989) 
On entering rhe field, we enter the domain of 
lived experience. Whar is "safe" is a study in 
smoke and mirrors. Everyone has a story, com-

plete with vested interests, and all the stories 
collide into contentious assemblages of partial 
truths, political fictions, personal foibles, 
military propaganda, and cultural lore. The 
louder the story, especially when it comes to 
violence and war, the less representative of the 
lived experience it is likely to be. In the midst 
of wars of propaganda and justification, the 
most silenced stories at war's epicenters are 
generally the most authentic. 
To understand a war is not the same thing 
as understanding a war in the town of X and 
among the people who populate it. In the same 
way that a body cannot be understood by 
a finger, a war cannot be understood by a 
single locale. It was the war in Mozambique, 
and the Mozambicans' experience of it, that 
formed the core concern of my research. 
Because this research question demanded dif­
ferent field techniques than those normally 
associated with anthropological studies set in 
a specific locale, I followed an approach I call· 
the "ethnography of a warzone" (Nordstrom 
1994b). Here, the theme of war� rather than a 
specific locality, situates the study. Process and 
people supplant place as an ethnographic 
"site." My reticence to situate this study in a 
given locale extends to the urban centers and 
the institutions of power brokers (the "site" of 
traditional political science research) - the 
places where war is formally defined, debated, 
and directed. These sites add to the study, they 
do not define it. 
I selected Zambezia Province, in north­
central Mozambique, as my home base for the 
majority of my stay in the country as it was 
the province most seriously affected by the 
war, and one that offered rich cultural diver­
sity. But in the year and a half I worked in 
Mozambique, I traveled not only throughout 
the province but also through six of Mozam­
bique's ten provinces. In each location, I fol­
lowed the ebb and flow of the war from urban 
centers to rural outposts, visiting locations on 
the peripheries of the war, locales that had 
recently been attacked, and villages and towns 
that had changed hands from the government 
to the rebel forces a number of times. Roads 
were heavily land mined and subject to fre­
quent attacks and seldom, if ever, traveled 
outside of sporadic military convoys confined 
to a few main transitways. Like virtually every-one else who did not have the skills to walk 
across provinces, I depended on air travel. 
Unlike many, my major mode of travel was 
cargo planes taking emergency supplies to war­
devastated areas lucky enough to have a flat 
dirt runway relatively free of mines. In what I 
found to be one of the war's many ironies, my 
ethnography, like emergency supplies and gov­
ernment officials, was confined to locations 
where a landing strip and a security clearance 
could be eked out. I dubbed this "runway 
anthropology." 
The nature of this ethnography thus reflects 
in many ways the nature of the reality of many 
Mozambican lives: conflict, starvation, depri­
vation, and the demands of work, family, 
and health have produced an extremely fluid 
population. As I noted before, nearly one-third 
of the population has experienced some form 
of dislocation. 8 These Mozambicans can no 
longer, at present, ground their "selves'' -their 
lives, their livelihoods, their dreams -in a 
single place. In responding to an external 
threat, they carry reworked notions of home, 
family, communit y, and survival with them. 
Repositioning has come to define a major 
sociocultural current. 
In each place I visited, I made a concerted 
effort to collect the stories of average people, 
many of whom found themselves on the front 
lines of a war they neither started nor sup­
ported. Eschewing the popular notion that 
battlefields are comprised of male adult sol­
diers -especially since the vast majority of 
casualties in Mozambique were noncombat­
ants - I turned my attention to both sexes and 
all ages, equally. Given the circumstances of 
the war, I worked in areas where the rebels 
were in close proximity, but I never elected to 
work in rebel-occ upied areas. 
The logistics of conducting an ethnographic 
study in a warzone are not as complicat ed as 
the fact that we begin to care about the world 
we have entered. We can sympathize with the 
trauma of a person looking over the charred 
landscapes that used to be called home; feel the 
gut-wrenching horror they feel wondering if 
the rest of their family made it to safety or not. 
We can understand the overwhelming grief of 
people who had to leave a family member 
where she or he fell, unburied, as they fled an 
attack, knowing they have condemned a loved 

WAR ON THE FRONT LINES 253 
one to roam the earth as a sorrowful rogue 
spirit with no resting place. 
Everyone grapples with violence in his or her 
own way. What is traumatic, difficult, hopeful 
is in all likelihood different for every person in 
the field. It is impossible to escape the impact 
of the sheer violence: I will carry with me 
images of violence for the rest of my life which 
are variously poignant and unsettling, absurd 
and tragic. Some resonate with examples in the 
general literature and media on warfare, and 
these constitute the acceptable, and in many 
ways privileged, discourses on violence. The 
maimed and the dead -victims of political 
torture, heroes and martyrs of causes, innocent 
victims of repression -fill this category. 
Yet it is not the raw violence per se that most 
captures the essence of war for me. Curiously , 
the images that have done so for me seldom 
appear in formal discussions of warfare. To 
give one example: one of the things that struck 
me the first time I saw the massacre of inno­
cent civilians was that, in the physical trauma 
of death, many of the dead men's pants had 
fallen down. This example may appear frivo­
lous to people who have not witnessed such 
scenes. But to those living daily with the 
specter of large-scale political violence, death 
scenes of familials -not only butchered but 
exposed -present a powerful statement on 
death, (in)dignity, and the nature of human 
existence. 
It is misleading, however, to focus exclu­
sively on the physicality of bodies as the repos­
itory of violence. When I am among people 
who have not been near the brute force of war, 
I am often asked, "What was it like? Did you 
see many dead bodies?" The question rankles. 
Even if I were to answer the question, which I 
never do, it would not be the ruined bodies 
themselves I have seen that summarize the 
agonizing truths of war for me but the stories 
behind the bodies. In considering the question 
of what war is like, I might, for example, think 
of the color pink and the trails it has left on 
the landscape of war in my mind. Two stories, 
related only by color; help to explain this. 
Early in my years of studying war, I was vis­
iting a village I did not know well, several 
hours travel from my in-field home. I was 
sleeping in the house of "a relative of a friend 
of a friend" I had never met. Quite early in the morning, I was roused unexpectedly from bed 
and asked to get dressed. No explanation, no 
food or coffee. There was something people 
wanted me to see. A group of men were 
waiting outside the door, most of whom I did 
not know, and we set off on foot through the 
fields and finally into the forest. We walked for 
quite a while it seemed. Finally we came into 
a small clearing, and in front of us a dead man 
hung from a tree-suspended on a pink bed­
sheet. The man in charge turned to me in 
concern and said, "We need to find out if this 
is murder or suicide." Had this man chosen to 
escape insurmountable personal troubles, 
impossible war demands? Or had the war 
found him? Had someone killed him? 
I am never sure why I am included in or 
excluded from certain things in the field. I had 
no idea why I was brought to witness this poor 
man hanging forlornly in the early morning 
sun. Did people think because of my interest 
in traditional medicine I was a medical spe­
cialist? Did they want someone to witness the 
inescapable violence people had to live with, 
someone who could carry the story back to the 
urban centers? I never did find out. They asked 
me to help examine the body to try to deter­
mine if the man had been murdered or not, 
and I did. But mostly I remember watching 
that body swing on the pink bedsheet in the 
slight breeze as I wondered about war, tragedy, 
absurd ity, and the insurmountable. 
The second story begins in the same time 
period. I had a friend in the community in 
which I lived who eased the tragedies of war 
for me. He was a fun and life-affirming man 
who loved ceremonies, parties, a good joke, 
and his fellow human beings. I could always 
talk to him about the war, and he listened with 
a sympathetic ear. He hated the conflict tearing 
at his country. 
The next time I visited the country, I looked 
forward to reuniting with my friend. The war 
continued, and deprivation and terror had 
touched everyone's lives. When I reached my 
friend's house, I was surprised ro see an assault 
rifle leaning in the entryway, a revolver on the 
living room table. I settled into a chair to catch 
up on the news. An armed man material ized 
in the shadows of the porch and had a hurried 
whispered conversation with my host. I looked 
quizzically at my friend when he returned, and 

254 CAROLYN NORDSTROM 
he sighed and handed me a photo album. The 
album itself was the kind you could find at any 
department store: the cover depicted the 
common scene of a young couple walking 
hand in hand in some romantic locale at sunset 
-alJ colored in bright pinks and images of 
serenity. Inside, however , were pages of pho­
tographs of maimed, mutilated, and murdered 
youths from the area. My friend shrugged his 
shoulders and explained the war had reached 
an intolerable level, something had to be done 
to save the country. He had decided to join the 
"security forces" to combat the "terrorists ." 
The pictures were of his work, the "solutions" 
he and those he worked with employed. The 
victims, mostly youths, looked to me to have 
died alone and unarmed: in a search for infor­
mation; as a warning delivered in a message of 
terror; in a fearful and retributive rage, any­
thing but as soldiers on a battlefield. I have 
never gotten over the shock of this. How could 
I be friends with a man capable of such 
torture? How could I have been friends with 
such a man? My friendship with this person is 
over. I have not kept in touch with him. But 
the impossible quandary of the situation stays 
with me: it represents the harsh realities of war 
that many live with on a day-to-day basis. And 
it is not so much the gruesome pictures of 
bodies that distress me; it is the hopeless incon­
gruity of their being in that photo album with 
the serene pink cover. 
These are not the only scenes that define the 
heart of war for me, nor the only colors, sights, 
smells, tragedies, and fears I have experienced 
through others' experiences of war. Each one 
gives a depth and a complexity to violent con­
flict that goes well beyond the shallow depic­
tions of war that are offered in the traditional 
texts and media sound bites that "describe" 
war. 
Creativity 
[The world is] created out of human 
experience. 
E. A. Ruch and K. C. Anyanwa (1984) 
Renamo, with its tactics of severing the noses, 
lips, and ears of civilians, seems to reclaim the original sense of the absurd: "The absurd, 
from the Latin, absurdus, is literally the deaf, 
the voiceless, and hence the irrational" (Ruf 
1991:65). 
But if war, especially terror warfare, strives 
to destroy meaning and sense, people strive to 
create it. This, ultimately, is why dirty war 
is doomed to fail. No matter how brute the 
force applied to subjugate a people, local-level 
behaviors arise to subvert the hold violence 
exerts on a population. This, of course, is a 
highly contested process. The situation at the 
local level is complex and contradictory. There 
are people working within the political, mili­
tary, and economic spheres who seek to benefit 
from the fractures caused by war. Others work 
equally hard to solve the inequalities, injus­
tices, and abuses caused by war and those who 
exploit violence for their own gain. It is the 
latter that interests me here. 
Traditional Western approaches to violent 
conflict do not often recognize the creative 
strategies people on the front lines employ to 
survive the war. I was little prepared for the 
way in which people tried to reconfigure the 
destructive violence that marked their lives and 
to rebuild worlds so wrenchingly taken away 
from them by violence. It was only when I was 
in the middle of Mozambique (both literally 
and in terms of my research) that I began to 
appreciate the creativity of the average people 
caught in the traumatic contingencies of 
warfare. While this creativity does not extend 
to all people and all parts of the war, I am 
always encouraged by how much exists in day­
to-day life. To give an idea of the range and 
richness of these world-building actions, I will 
give three different examples that can be intro­
duced as the creating of symbols (the three 
monkeys), of society (the transport of fish), 
and of culture (the work of healers ). 
The first example involves three little carved 
wooden monkeys. When I first went to the 
country in 1988, the war economy was such 
that few market goods of any kind were avail­
able. I was always interested in the fact that 
one of the things you could find with regular­
ity was a set of three little carved monkeys: see 
no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. For me, this 
was especially telling considering the regular­
ity with which one heard stories of Renamo 
severing the ears and lips of civilians to silence 

WAR ON THE FRONT LINES 255 
resistance and control political will. One day I 
was sitting on the curb talking with a street 
vendor acquaintance of mine with whom I fre­
quently sat and discussed the war (it had taken 
his legs, his family, and his home) and better 
days. During a lull in the conversation, with a 
sly twinkle in his eye, he pulled out a set of 
three monkeys to show me. The first monkey 
had one hand over his mouth and the other 
over one eye, but the second eye peered out 
wide open and both ears were uncovered and 
listening. The second monkey had one hand 
over one eye and the other hand over one ear; 
this time the mouth was uncovered and twisted 
into a grimace or a cry, but still one eye was 
watching and one ear was listening. The last 
monkey sat with a cynjcal grin on its face: eyes, 
ears, and mouth open and cognizant. This 
monkey sat with its hands covering its groin. 
The symbolism is not lost on Mozambicans: 
the numbers of women who have been raped 
in the war are legion, and a significant number 
of men have been emasculated both physically 
and figuratively. 
I have returned to Mozambique twice since 
my first trip and have traveled from the plush 
offices of power brokers to the crumbling 
embers of villages in the far reaches of the 
country. And in the places where force became 
violence, the subversive message of the 
monkeys -that we wiJI cover our ears when 
you cut off our lips and still look with one eye; 
that we will watch, listen, and speak, but we 
will "cover our tails" in doing so -was 
reflected time and again, in village after village 
after town. The first part of the message 
conveys resistance; the second laces it with wry 
humor. The two together have given many a 
hope and a will to survive a very dirty war. 
The three monkeys stand as popular sym­
bologues (dialogues based on symbolic repre­
sentations) that speak both to the war and 
through the war: statements const ructed by 
the victims themselv es to convey the complex 
way violence is lived, learned, subverted, and 
survived. Symbologues abound during war. 
"Violent concentrated action," writes Anton in 
Artaud (1974:62), "is like lyricism; it calls 
forth supernatural imagery, a bloodshed of 
images." To speak directly about the war is to 
court danger. So songs, myths, parables, jokes, 
and stories circulate -each a palimpsest of meaning wherein "mythical" villains, heroes,. 
murderers, and traitors implicate contempo­
rary actors in the war drama. Everyone in the 
know "knows" what is being conveyed about 
whom: who to trust, fear, avoid. For those not 
in the know (one hopes, those who have the 
power to kill), these are "simply stories." The 
"reason, Mozambicans apply in such situa­
tions extends well beyond that ascribed by 
Enlightenment philosophies focusing on dis­
cursive consciousness. It is a form of creative 
reasoning that combines symbolic, emotional, 
representational, discursive, and existential 
realities. Generally speaking, the split between 
epistemol ogy, ontology, and life is an artificial 
one for Mozambicans. 
In African culture ... experience does not 
address itself to reason alone, imagination 
alone, feeling and intuition alone, but to the 
totaliry of a person's faculry. The truth of this 
experience is lived and felt, not merely 
thought of. (Ruch and Anyanwa 1984:86-7) 
There are many other ways people work ro 
subvert terror and destruction and to recon­
struct a purposeful social universe. In Mozam­
bique, these are not just part of the war 
response; they are critical to survival. The 
second example I cite here became apparent to 
me when I was in an inland town that had 
recently been attacked a number of times. 
Crops and animals decimated and goods 
srolen, the markets had little to offer. I was 
therefore taken aback to find for sale some fish 
that had seen better days. This is particularly 
noteworthy , for it entailed several men 
walking with baskets of ocean fish on their 
heads for seven days from the coast through 
several language and ethnic communities and 
a number of dangerous war zones. This is a 
trip no formal trader would brave: the dangers 
were too great and the profit negligible. So 
why make such a trip? The men's answers to 
me -"Because that's how life goes on, -did 
not make a lot of sense at first. But as I listened 
to them talk, I realized that through their 
journey they performed an invaluable func­
tion. They carried messages for families and 
friends separated by the fighting; conveyed 
details on troop deployments and dangers; and 
transmitted critical economic, crop, trade, and 
political news, not to mention gossip and irrev-

256 CAROLYN NORDSTROM 
erent stories, between communities severed 
from one another by the war. They linked dif­
ferent ethnic and language groups in a state­
ment that the war was not about local rivalries 
and could not be, if they were to survive. They 
forged trade and social networks through the 
disordered landscapes of violence. And by 
walking for seven days with baskets of fish on 
their heads through lethal front lines, they 
simply defied the war in a way that everyone 
they passed could enjoy and draw strength 
from. They were, literally, constructing social 
order out of chaos. 
These traders created outgoing linkages in 
the country. In a complement ary process, 
people also work to create a valid community 
and a stable social universe wherever they find 
themselves. Curandeiros9 are a locus of cre­
ativity in solving the problems of war. Encoded 
in their traditions are idea(l)s that mitigate the 
harmful effects of abusive power, violence, and 
warfare. While African medicine has long · 
assisted in warfare (Lan 1985; Ranger 1982, 
1985), in Mozambique it has largely con­
demned Renamo's ruthlessness. I spoke with 
well over a hundred curandeiros throughout 
the country, and most had developed "treat­
ments" aimed at protecting civilians and ame­
liorating the ·violence unleashed on society. 
In refugee camps, in informal dislocation 
centers, in burned-out villages trying to 
rebuild, I found curandeiros performing treat­
ments to take the war out of the communit y, 
the violence out of the people, and the insta­
bility and terror out of the culture. As one 
curandeiro explained, 
People have JUSt seen too much war, too much 
violence -they have gotten the war in them. 
We treat this, we have to. If we don't take the 
war out uf the people, it will just continue on 
and on, past Renamo, past the end of the war, 
into the communities, into the families, to ruin 
us. 
Scholars such as Pierre Bourdieu ( 1977) and 
Jean Comaroff and john Comaroff (1991) 
brought to academic attention what the curan­
deiros have long known, that hegemonic ideals 
and cultures of violence can be dangerously , 
and unwittingly, reproduced throughout a 
society and can even undermine resistance and 
resolution. Hundreds of conversations I had with 
Mozambicans reflected their preoccupation 
with defusing the culture of violence the war 
had wrought. It is a violence, they stress, that 
can last far beyond formal military cease-fires. 
People constantly reminded themselves and 
others about the insidious nature of violence, 
which allows it to reproduce itself and to 
destroy worlds and lives in the process. It is 
as if, fearful of the tendency toward habitus 
-toward what Bourdieu (1977:191) calls 
"unrecognizable, socially recognized violence .. 
-Mozambicans have set into motion a cultural 
dynamic that continually challenges the 
entrenchment of a culture of violence. The fol­
lowing quote is from my field notes. I was 
sitting with several older women in a village 
that had seen a great deal of the war. The 
bombed-out and uninhabited husks of build­
ings stood outlined behind us in the afternoon 
sun, behind the sea of small thatch and mud 
huts that had sprung up to house the many 
people displaced by the war. We were sitting 
on the ground chewing on the stalk of a weed 
(I was chewing on the weed because the 
women had handed it to me; the women did 
so out of a habit they had developed to 
appease their appetites when food was scarce). 
We were talking about the war's impact on 
people's lives. 
When people come back to our community 
after having been kidnapped and spending 
time with the Bandidos [Renamo], or arrive 
here after their community has been destroyed 
by the war, there are a lot of things they PZeed. 
They require food and clothing, they need a 
place to live, they need medical attention. But 
one of the most important things they need is 
calm -to have the violence taken out of them. 
We ask that everyone who arrives here be 
taken to a curandeiro for treatment. The 
importance of the curandeiro lies not only in 
his or her ability to treat the diseases and phys­
ical ravages of war but in the ability to take 
the violence out of a person and to reintegrate 
them back into a healthy lifestyle. You see, 
people who have been exposed to the war, 
well, some of this violence can affect them, 
stick with them, like a rash on the soul. They 
ca·rry this violence with them back to their 
communities and their homes and their lives, 
and they begin to act in ways they have never 

WAR ON THE FRONT LINES 257 
acted before. They bring the war back home 
rvith them -they become more confused, more 
violent, more dangerous, and so too does the 
rvhole community. We need to protect against 
this. The curandeiro makes consultations and 
patiently talks to the person, he gives medici­
nal treatments, he performs ceremonies, he 
rvorks with the whole family, he includes the 
commun ity. He cuts the person off from mzy 
holds the war has on him or her, he scrapes off 
the violence from their spirit, he makes them 
forget what they have seen attd felt and expe­
rienced in the war, he makes them alive again, 
alive and part of the communi ty. He does 
this with Bandido [ Renamo] soldiers too. If 
someone finds a soldier wandering alone, we 
take him and bring him to the curandeiro. 
Most people do not really want to fight. These 
soldiers have done terrible thhzgs, but man)' of 
them were kidnapped and forced to fight. They 
dream of their home and family and macham­
bas [farms], of being far away from any war. 
The curandeiro takes the war out of them, he 
tmeducates their war education. He reminds 
them how to be a part of their family, to work 
their machamba, to get along, to be a part of 
the community. He cures the violence that 
others have taught. 
In the midst of war, the treatments the 
curandeiros provide are not set prescriptions 
faithfully reproduced. They are creative acts 
in the true sense of the word. Worlds are 
destroyed in war; they must be re-created. Not 
just worlds of home, family, communit y, and 
economy but worlds of definition, both per­
sonal and cultural. As people look out over a 
ruined landscape that was once home -now 
shorn of life and livelihood, humanity and 
hope-they cannot simply "reconstruct society 
as it was before." For in the violence and 
upheaval, it cannot be, may never be, the same 
as "it was before." 
In the face of the monkey's creation of sym­
bologues, the fish vendor's forging of social 
order, and the curandeiro' s production of 
culture, I find the theories on the cultural con­
struction of reality relevant but inadequate. 10 
They start from the basis of an operating 
culture that imparts knowledge through inter­
personal interaction. What happens when very 
little is operating and what has operated is of 
little immediate use? What shards of cultural relevance do the vendors and healers have to 
build on? Worlds cannot simply be created; 
they must be created anew. How do the poetics 
and practices of the people in these three 
examples interweave in the creation of cultures 
of survival and resistance? 
The dilemma is clear: between the world as 
it was, the world as it should be, and the now 
of a world destroyed lies an abyss, a disconti­
nuity, a need to define the one by the other, and 
the impossibility of doing so. The solution, 
Mozambicans taught me, lies, in part, with the 
imagination. I have come to think that this is 
a trait people have specifically nurtured to 
counteract destructive violence. When people 
look out over a land that should resonate with 
meaning and life, but that now stares blankly 
back with incomprehensible images of barren 
fields, broken communities, tortured bodies, 
and shattered realities, they are left with the 
choice of accepting a deadened world or cre­
ating a livable one. It is the imagination -
creativity -that bridges the abyss, if not to 
reconstruct the past, to make the present 
livable. 
Scarry (1985:163) has argued that pain 
unmakes the world and imagining makes it. 
Together "pain and imagining are the '&aming 
events' within whose boundaries all other per­
ceptual, somatic, and emotional events occur; 
thus, between the two extremes can be mapped 
the whole terrain of the human psyche." She 
invokes Sartre in exploring the idea that 
absence provokes an imagining of a special sort. 
Sartre, for example, draws conclusions from 
the fact that his imagined Pierre is so impov­
erished by comparison with his real friend 
Pierre, that his imagined Annie has none of 
the VIbrancy, spontaneity, and limidess depth 
of presence of the real Annie. Bur, of course, 
had he compared his imagined friends nor to 
his real-friend s-when-present but to his wholly 
absent friends, his conclusions would have 
been supplemented by other, very different 
conclusions. That is, the imagined Pierre is 
shadowy, dry, and barely presenr compared to 
the real Pierre, but is much more vibrantly 
present than the absent Pierre. (Ibid.) 
In like fashion, it is the destruction of the 
world that prompts such vivid powers of imag­
ining in victims of war and violence. 

258 CAROLYN NORDSTROM 
But unlike Scarry's view, some Mozambi­
cans are able to imagine their real friend, their 
real home, their real society and culture as 
vibrantly as the "real thing." We can afford to 
leave underdeveloped our ability to imagine 
our real friend Pierre in a reasonably stable 
world. But when Pierre is dead, disappeared, 
or maimed, and when the world that held him 
is so hopelessly destroyed that left unattended 
it can only ring a death toll for the society 
affected, people must create, and to do so, they 
must first imagine what it is they are going to 
create. For Pierre wilJ never be the same, and 
the world is still at war. 
For Scarry ( 1992), imagining is grounded in 
perceptual mimesis. For the Mozambicans, 
contemplating their ruined viiJag es and con­
tentious political imbroglios, there is little to 
mime -and imagining becomes an act of pure 
creativity. 
Not aU Mozambicans have such developed 
powers of creative imagining. Not unusua lly,· 
the creative members of the culture -healers, 
visionaries, performers -have developed these skills to a fine art. Their talents lie not only 
with their abilities to imagine but also with 
their abilities ro convey these images to others 
so that they, too, may share in the reconstruc­
tion of their symbolic and social universes. I 
have visited a number of communit ies that had 
been recently decimated by the war. One of the 
most powerful experiences I had at these times 
was sitting with people amid the fragments of 
what was once their home and community and 
listening, watching, the imagining -the cre­
ation of identity, home, and resistance afresh. 
I choose the word watching as well as listen­
ing purposefully: as the Mozambicans talk 
about what has happened and what will 
happen, and as they discuss this in the context 
of human nature and the meanjng of life, I 
found I could not only understand but "see" 
the world they were creating. Apparently so 
did the others present. New identities of suf­
fering and resistance were forged, home was 
reinvented, the world was relandscaped with 
significance, people survived.
