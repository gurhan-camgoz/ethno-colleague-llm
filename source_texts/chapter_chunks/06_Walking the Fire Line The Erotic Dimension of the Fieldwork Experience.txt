Walking the Fire Line: The 
Erotic Dimension of the 
Fieldwork Experience 
Kate Altork 
His hands reach up to remove the camera fr<?m 
around my neck, the tape recorder from my 
shoulder. Then he solemnly undresses me, as if 
I were a small and very sweet child. I stand 
willful before him, and there is no fear. His 
face is smudged with smoke and dirt, as he 
reaches out to pull me down into the water. 
Fighting the forest fire for days has not worn 
him down but, rather, stimulated him in 
strange and unexpected ways. His strong 
hands move like small, pulsing animals as he 
wraps my legs around his hard body. Looking 
up, I see pine trees, smell pine trees, taste wild� 
ness. The forest seems to be leaping, blurred 
by smoke from the huge fire many miles away. 
But we are underwater now, away from the 
smoke and heat, rolling like smooth river rocks 
in the stream. And we are suffused in sunlight. 
Suddenly, I .hear the helicopter moving over­
head. It awakens me only seconds before the 
alarm blasts from the bedside table. I swiftly 
leap from the bed, my back and belly drenched 
in sweat. 'I don't believe it!', I mutter to 
myself. 'This is the third erotic dream like that 
I've had in a week! My fieldwork seems to be 
permeating every aspect of my life. I can't get away from it!' Packing up my gear in the 
hallway -cameras, tape recorder , notebooks, 
blank tapes - I vacillate between disappoint� 
ment that it was just a dream and a growing 
sense of ambivalence. This fieldwork project 
has a grip on me that I'm unable to break away 
from even when I want a good night's sleep. It 
feels like an invasion -and a sweet and sour 
one, at that. 
I was eighteen months into a fieldwork project 
in a rural, mountain town in ldaho when forest 
fires began breakjng out in record numbers in 
the summer of 1992. Seven consecutive years 
of drought had rendered the land dangerously 
dry and vulnerable to fires started, more often 
than not, by lightning. Previous records were 
shattered, and a total of nearly 300,000 acres 
had succumbed to fire since 1985, more than 
10 per cent of the gross acreage of that par­
ticular national forest. 
As I studied and wrote about this place and 
the vernacular language utilized by the region's 
inhabitants to articulate and claim it, huge sec­
tions of the landscape were burning. All 
summer long, I had watched the planes and 
helicopters come and go, the small, local

This medium, on a continuum as she 
describes it, moves from lively interest to pas­
sionate (although not necessarily consum­
mated) erotic attachment (1993a: 11) and 
facilitates the fieldwork endeavor. It does so, 
she asserts, by motivating informants to enter 
into a relationship, rather than feeling intruded 
upon by the anthropologist's presence or ques­
tions. Newton's unconsummated 'crush' on 
Kay, an ·elderly woman she interviewed exten­
sively for her ethnohistory of the gay and 
lesbian community of Cherry Grove (Newton 
1993b), appears to have been beneficial to 
both parties. Of critical importance to the 
present enquiry, however, is her statement that 
the relationship significa ntly inspired her intel­
lectual and creative work. She argues that 'the 
most intense attractions have generated the 
most ere a tive energy, as if the work were a 
form of courting and seduction' (1993a: 15). 
This sentiment is reflected in the earlier 
writing of Manda Cesara. 3 It was whiie 
making love with an informant whom she calls 
Douglas that she experienced an epiphanic 
moment. It was at that precise moment, she 
claimed, that she grasped a basic truth about 
the Lenda4 culture. 'Body and brain were one, 
as were mind and flesh, the past and present, 
life and death', she wrote. 'I experienced the 
cerebral in the flesh. In Lenda nothing ever is 
purely cerebral, it is always mingled with flesh' 
(1982: 55). 
Cesara wrote openly about her consum­
mated sexual encounters in the field, claiming 
that 'it was inevitable that some ethnographet.:s 
in certain settings should experience such an 
encounter' (1982: 59). Predating Newton's 
article by nearly a decade, Cesara's work 
asserted that the emotion of loving one indi­
vidual in· a culture allows one to lay hold of 
the culture itself by way of that individual 
person (1982: 60). Whether the relationship is 
cons ummated or, as in Newton's case, is con­
tained as what might be caJled an affair of the 
emotions may be secondary to the fact that 
both anthropologists felt themselves and their 
work to be enriched by their passionate (and, 
of critical importance, reciprocated) attach­
ments in the field. 
What is it about the fieldwork setting that 
might foster an opening to erotic possibilities? 
As Dubisch (1995) notes, it certainly isn't the academic preparation for the field, where the 
prevailing protocol still seems to involve the 
twist that one has to be in the field in order to 
learn about how to be in the field (p. 30). And, 
as she rightly points out, advice about sex is 
not a part of the preparatory package for one 
embarking upon field research. Yet, as many 
anthropologists know, the most compelling 
ethnographic writings inevitably contain rhap­
sodic and sensual descriptions of people and 
places. What happens, on a subjective level, 
when an anthropologist and an entirely new 
environment collide? 
It has been my experience that any new 
locale sends all of my sensory modes into over­
drive in the initial days and weeks of my stay. 
I can recall the particular smell of the earth in 
the western wilderness as the snow receded 
from the trees after a long winter. I remember 
the pungent smell of sargasso seaweed fer­
menting in the shore break during the height 
of summer at a sea-lion refuge in California. 
The mention of a place can often trigger a 
cacophony of sensory memories : the taste of 
Greece, the sounds of downtown Washington, 
DC, the almost unearthly quality of the light 
surrounding the Sangria de Cristo mountain 
range near Santa Fe. 
Unfortunately, perhaps, the adaptation 
process dulls the sharp sensory feedback we 
receive from our surroundings once we've been 
in a given locale for a time. And·for the anthro­
pologist, traditionally charged with the task of 
scientifically studying 'the Other' while dressed 
in the straitjacket of so-called objectivity, the 
insistent feedback of the senses has often been 
something to be denied, squelched, or, at very 
least, granted secondary status to the intellect. 
It's almost as if there was something not quite 
right about responding and writing from a 
reflexive stance -a personal place -unless one 
hastened to link an overarching cerebral tone 
to the affective to ensure credibility. 
Even VanMaanen (1988), who has written 
eloquently about the writing of 'impressionis­
tic tales' as a means through which to breathe 
life into the field experience, is reluctant to 
allow the neophyte to bypass the traditional 
ethnographic writing route to engage in such 
passionate writing. When it's all said and done, 
be states, 'On advice to students of fieldwork, 
my feelings are traditional. There is, alas, no 

THE EROTIC DIMENSION OF THE FIELDWORK EXPERIENCE 95 
better training than going out and trying one's 
hand at realist tales' (1988: 139). Earlier in the 
text, he defines the narrator of the realist tale 
as one who 'poses as an impersonal conduit 
who ... passes on more-or-less objective data 
in a measured intellectual style ... uncontam­
inated by personal bias ... A studied neutral­
ity characterizes the realist tale' (1988: 47). 
That he finds this 'studied neutrality' feasible, 
or the notion of 'posing' as 'an impersonal 
conduit' workable, I find curious in light of his 
extensive exploration into the ethnographic 
enterprise. Moreover , I detect in his writing a 
hint of uncertainty about the true validity of 
more evocative texts, in spite of the fact that 
he ostensibly champions such efforts, and 
perhaps a dash of the old boot-camp mental­
ity. But the subtext says: 'I had to do the cere­
bral [read linear and grueling] work before I 
got to ·write from the heart [the fun part, and 
I paid my dues to earn the right to have fun], 
so you should do that, too.' 
· I would contend that a healthy blend of 
working from the mind and the heart is in 
order, and is the logical compromise here for 
the scholar negot1atmg the mind/heart 
dichotomy. The ongoing myth that one can 
separate the intellectual from the emotional is 
reminiscent of the mind-body split that the 
Western medical institution has traditionally 
embraced philosophically (and is just begin­
ning to question and move beyond, I might 
add). To compartmentalize is to master, it 
seems to claim, in the face of compelling evi­
dence to the contrary, evidence that it is the 
interconnectedness of bodily and emotional 
functions which shapes the lives of both 
healthy and unhealthy individuals. 
Anthropologist Catherine Lutz speaks elo­
quently to this issue in her recent (1986) 
article, which criticizes the Euro-American 
construction of emotion. The central tenet of 
this construct, which she flatly labels 'emotion 
against thought' (1986: 289), centers on the 
notion that the emotional is antithetical to 
rationality (1986: 290). As such, Lutz writes, 
the prevailing view holds that cTo be emotional 
is to fail to rationally process information and 
hence to undermine the possibilities for sensi­
ble or intelligent action' (1986: 291). The ram­
ifications of this view have been taken to heart 
by anthropologists concerned with building a base of professional credibility and respect 
among their academic colleagues. This has 
strongly influenced many ethnographers, who 
have traditionally striven to excise the affective 
from their ethnographies in order that the 
work be viewed as 'scientific' and, therefore, 
valid. 
The logic behind this choice has become 
chillingly justified by the recent backlash 
against so called 'reflexive' writings, in which 
those who bring their emotions and personal 
biases into the discourse for analysis and 
examination have been accused of being 'too 
personaP.5 'Self-indulgent', they sniff when a 
field account is particularly delicious - more 
like a chocolate mousse than a piece of dry 
toast - 'unprofessional', 'inappropriate'. Or, 
worse yet, some anthropologists are accused of 
'going native', as if by immersing themselves 
in a culture they have been somehow caught 
with their anthropological pants down doing 
the wrong thing (getting involved to the point 
where they are enjoying their work, perhaps?) 
at the wrong time. 
As for those critics, who perhaps have never 
had the nerve to skinny-dip in their own work 
(while trusting their brains to function simul­
taneously), or to write from the hip-or from 
any other body part below the brain, for that 
matter -those critics sharpen their No. 2 
pencils and produce another barrage of unin­
telligible, but academically familiar, books 
and articles. Business as usual, they say. What 
a relief. 
For when certain anthropologists began 
writing more self-reflexive and passionate 
ethnographies/ a brief reprieve from the 
mind-body split occurred. The tight corsets 
were loosened, the mouth was allowed to 
relax, and a veritable flood of feelings and 
decidedly subjective materials came pouring 
out, mixed nicely with objective, rational per­
ceptions and ideas into a fragrant, new intel­
lectual stew. As though a fire hydrant in an 
inner-city neighborhood had broken on a swel­
tering August afternoon, some got to run 
around for a few minutes getting wet and 
having a ball. They also reached their goal, 
which was to cool down. 
But, as one might imagine, it didn't take 
long for the word cops to come in with their 
sirens blaring, and their lights flashing. Before

long the water is turned off. The kids go back 
to playing desultory and predicta ble games of 
stick ball in the streets. The anthropologists go 
back to writing from the head, hiding their 
clamoring feelings under the heavy blanket of 
technical language comprehensible only to 
their own kind. The party is over. Is this what 
we want? 
Some anthropologists appear to be caught in 
the trap, wanting to integrate the emotions and 
the intellect into the language of anthropology, 
but fearful of criticism, of not being taken seri­
ously. Although we may subjectively know 
that our senses work together with our intel­
lects to provide us with data in complex and 
elegant ways, we persist in asking fieldworkers 
to operate predominantly from their eyes and 
ears and- most certainly -from the waist up. 
Repressing or avoiding our own erotic and 
sensual responses, we work in a haze of 
sensory anesthesia of our own making. 
Places Penetrating People: 
Opening to the Senses 
I sit between two men, in a crowded roomful 
of men, listening to fire talk. The room smells 
of aftershave and leather, and laughter punc­
tuates the space as they take a break from 
logistics to share an inside joke. Fire experts 
from Washington, DC, nod in agreement as 
local experts discuss their strategies for putting 
out four major blazes which have burned over 
27,000 acres of forest in recent days. They talk 
a fire language that's rough and masculine. 
'Most of the heat in the fire is out at the head, 
and it's running to the north', they say. 'We 
had another fire pop up down here at Cherry 
Creek and just barn! Right out of the clear blue 
sky. We pounced on this one down here with 
an engine and one crew that picked it up. I 
knew it would work. That guy's fire savvy. He 
knows fire and he knows his job.' 
Glancing over at the man next to me -he 
smells like sunlight and oak - I startle when I 
realize he is studying me. For a moment we 
lock eyes. A man across the table says, 'Let's 
hope you have a wet year next year', and 
another responds, 'Yeah, let's hope it goes the 
way of the wet year!' As laughter fills the 
room, I feel my face flush. The man next to me smiles a wry, winning grin and I return the 
smile, turning my face away, flustered . He's in 
charge of one of the fires, an Incident Com­
mander, as they call it. I enjoy listening to his 
husky, earnest voice as he talks about his fire­
fighting strategies. His hands move in swift, 
confident arcs through the air as he speaks. He 
says, �If this thing gets bigger, we may need a 
few more people, but we try to keep it lean and 
mean, so ... ' When I am not taking my own 
notes, I study the bold blond hairs running up 
and down his tanned arms, the other voices in 
the room entering and receding from my 
awareness. 
I struggle to integrate the cognitive disso­
nance I am feeling: the part of me that is 
attracted to these men who are, as a group, 
earnest and intelligent, charming and attrac­
tive, with the part of me that is unnerved and 
irritated by their blatant use of macho sexual 
imagery to discuss forest fires. The privileged 
sense of entitlement and ownership over a 
natural force which they appropriate by way 
of an insider's language seems, at times, to be 
both insidious and morally incorrect. Yet, as 
Cohn courageo usly admits in her essay on the 
experience of studying nuclear strategic ana­
lysts (whom she calls defense intellectu als), 
there is something thrilling about 'entering the 
secret kingdom, being someone in the know' 
in a realm that is both powerful and hidden 
from the outside world {1987: 704). Even as I 
struggled to analyze their 'fire language', and 
to situate it as a language of power and appro­
priation, I felt myself to be seduced by it, and 
felt privileged to be privy to it as a temporary 
'insider', an experience both uncomfor table 
and intriguing. 
Spontaneously, I ask this man if he will let 
me interview him about firefighting. When he 
says he'd like that and gives me the directions 
to his place for us to meet, I find my mind 
moving swiftly in two directions. One of them 
plans a list of fieldwork questions. But the 
other one ... the other one fantasizes. And it 
is those fantasies which find their way into my 
dreams, causing me to awaken sometimes in 
the middle of the night as I work the fire 
project. 
Nader (1986: 111) claims that ambivalent 
feelings are always involved in fieldwork. She 
recalls anthropologist Hortense Powdermaker 

THE EROTIC DIMENSION OF THE FIELDWORK EXPERIENCE 97 
remarking that walking the line between 
detachment and involvement is a built-in part 
of a field relationship. Nader writes, 'The 
amount of nocturnal dreaming and the ability 
to remember dreams seems to have multiplied 
several rimes over my usual behavior.' Landes 
(1986: 121) echoed that theme when she noted 
that one cannot separate 'the sensuousness of 
life from its abstractions, nor the researcher's 
personality from his experience.' The field­
work experience is, in other words, a highly 
subjective process, affected deeply by bringing 
to play all of the senses. 
When I locked eyes with the fire fighter, I 
thought of Landes' essay on her fieldwork 
experience in Brazil. The Brazilians call that 
gaze 'jogo de o/hos' (the game of eyes), Landes 
wrote. Her mentor cautioned that this can be 
dangerous in the field, as it might signal 'love 
informa tion'. He believed the direct gaze was 
improper in that particular culture (1986: 
135). In my fieldwork experiences, however , it 
often seems to facilitate matters, enhancing the 
communication process between myself and 
others in an already highly charged environ­
ment. Opening to the sensual aspects in my 
field surroundings, I am able to feel the envi­
ronment in multiple ways. This opening is not 
restricted to flirtatious interplay (which may or 
may not occur) but, rather, encompasses an 
expanded use of all of the senses and a will­
ingness to allow myself to gaze openly at 
others. 
What is it about the senses that make their 
synthesized integration into the fieldwork 
process so important for the anthropologist 
attempting to come to know a place and its 
people? The definitive writer on the power of 
the senses may be Diane Ackerman/ who has 
painstakingly explored each sensory mode for 
its unique qualities and who informs us that, 
'Seventy per cent of the body's sense receptors 
cluster in the eyes, and it is mainly through 
seeing the world that we appraise and under­
stand it' (1990: 230). She points out that 
lovers close their eyes when they kiss in order 
to shut out visual distractions. 'Lovers want to 
do serious touching and not be disturbed', she 
writes. 'So they close their eyes.' Such is the 
power of the gaze, and the explanation helps 
us to understand why intense encounters with 
people in the field can have, at times, a seduc-tive quality to them. Fieldwork involves 
coming into contact with many different 
people for the first time, a process which typ­
ically includes visual appraisal of the Other. 
Thus, the work itself brings with it possibili­
ties for intimate scrutiny and the resulting need 
to confront our feelings as we strive to under­
stand the workings of other minds in other 
places. 
Ackerman doesn't stop at vision, in her 
exploration into the nuances of the senses. 
About smell, for instance, she writes, 'Smells 
. .. rouse our dozy senses, pamper and indulge 
us ... stir the cauldron of our seductiveness, 
warn us of danger, lead us into temptation' 
(1990: 36). We bring our nose to the task, too: 
'Odor greatly affects our evaluation of things, 
and our evaluation of people' (1990: 39). And, 
as if that weren't enough to contend with, our 
ears also fight for equal access to the environ­
ment. Ackerman writes, 'Sounds thicken the 
sensory stew of our lives, and we depend on 
them to help us interpret, communicate with, 
and express the world around us' (1990: 175). 
Finally, she reminds us that we have another 
powerful tool through which to view the 
world because, 'as sages have long said, the 
sexiest part of the body and the best aphro­
disiac in the world is the imagination' (1990: 
131). 
As anthropologists have traditionally strug­
gled to maintain an objective, 'scientific' 
posture in the field, is it any wonder they have 
perhaps experienced stress and confusion? 
Instead of blocking out this wealth of sensory 
(and sensual) input, or relegating it to private 
field journals, we might consider making room 
for our sensual responses in our work. The 
senses that we are equipped with are powerful 
antennae through which to experience, pro­
viding us with full use of what Ackerman calls 
our synesthetic abilities (1990: 290). 
This involves opening to input from all of 
the senses, which combine to provide us with 
an enhanced understanding of others, of our 
surroundings, and of ourselves. In synesthesia, 
there is an intermingling of the senses so that, 
for example, one can taste a starlit sky or hear 
it, rather than only seeing it. Ackerman writes 
of how Rimbaud understood the power of 
synesthesia, as evidenced by his remark that 
the only way one can truly experience life is 

98 KATE ALTORK 
to be prepared for 'a long immense planned 
disordering of all the senses' (1990: 291). 
Is it any wonder that the social scientist 
might feel threatened by the rush of sensory 
input and emotions that floods in upon entry 
into a new culture ? How are we supposed to 
collect data in the cool and rational fashion we 
have been taught to affect, when the senses are 
'disordered'? It's no wonder that the erotic ele­
ments of the field are rarely discussed and 
often denied. Such a messy business, trying to 
tabulate data and cope with a barrage of smells 
and tastes and errant fantasies or desires at the 
same rime! In a culture which tends to deny 
dissonance (and deify order) this sensory 
barrage can often be viewed as an unpre­
dictable burden or liability. Yet one can only 
conjecture how the quality of ethnographic 
writings might be enhanced and refined if it 
were culturally sanctioned to write about the 
field from this vantage point, eliminating the 
need to repress or compartmentalize certain 
feelings and thoughts. 
One has onJy to think of the infamous 
Malinowski Diary (1989)8 to wonder how his 
view of the fieldwork experience might have 
been transformed if he had accepted his own 
passions. The academic community,s dogged 
focus on his sexual fantasies bypasses an 
equally compelling fact: Malinowski was a true 
synesthete. Throughout the Diary are descrip­
tions such as this one: 'Marvelous sunset. The 
whole world drenched in brick color - one 
could hear and feel that color in the air' (1989: 
67; italics in original). His ability to experience 
and to write in such a sensually descriptive 
manner allows us to witness the ways in which 
he was permeated by his environment. Perhaps 
his sexual stirrings, in part, were simply a 
byproduct of his sensual awakening in this new 
and exotic place. 'I went alone to Wawala,, he 
wrote. 'It was sultry, but I was energetic. The 
wilderness fascinated me ... Kenoria is pretty 
and has a wonderful figure. Impulse to "pat her 
on the belly". I mastered it' (1989: 153). One 
can follow, in these sentences, the way his mind 
moved from the sensual to the sexual in an 
organic, complex way, impacted by his intense 
emotional reaction to the landscape. To focus 
selectively on his comments about the woman 
he watched, by lifting it out of its environmen­
tal context, is both unfair and reductionistic. The Diary is fascinating, in part, for what it 
reveals about Malinowski's extreme struggle 
to avoid elements of his own sensory input in 
order to affect the mask of the neutral scien­
tist. This struggle was undoubtedly compli­
cated by his Polish Catholic upbringing, as 
well as by an academic background in physics 
and mathematics that is likely to have predis­
posed him (by training, as well as perhaps by 
natural predilection) to privilege the rational 
and logical over the emotional or passionate. 
Moreover, he was engaged in a meaningful 
relationship with the woman who would later 
become his wife. His guilt at harboring what 
he apparently interpreted to be sinful thoughts 
about the women he saw in the field (while his 
beloved was far away) probably further fueled 
his conflict. 9 
It is highly unlikely that his academic train­
ing in anthropology -influenced by the British 
school of anthropology with which he was 
associated -gave him any way of understand­
ing what was happening to him emotionally in 
New Guinea. Thus, having no context in 
which to house his erotic and sensual reveries, 
his writings disclose the incredible tensions 
with which he wrestled: 'I realized once again 
how materialistic my sense reactions are: my 
desire for the bottle of ginger beer is acutely 
tempting', he wrote. Then he confesses: 
'Finally I succumb to the temptation of 
smoking again.' He manages · to justify his 
behavior in the end by claiming, 'There is 
nothing really bad in all this. Sensual enjoy­
ment of the world is merely a lower form of 
artistic enjoyment' (1989: 171-2). How sad, it 
seems to me, that he squelched his abundant 
nature this way, torturing himself for what 
could be construed as his natural reactions to 
his milieu. 
Malinowski's efforts to repent for what can 
be called his 'sensual sinning in the mind' was 
militaristic in its rigidity. He wrote, 'I must 
have a system of specific formal prohibitions: 
I must not smoke, I must not touch a woman 
with sub-erotic intentions, I must not betray 
E.R.M. [his beloved back home] mentally, i.e., 
recall my previous relations with women, or 
rhink about future ones ... my main task now 
must be: work' (1989: 268). The emotional 
hardship and pain he experienced, generated 
by the struggle with his own complex mix of 

THE EROTIC DIMENSION OF THE FIELDWORK EXPERIENCE 99 
feelings, is a kind of human tragedy in the light 
of his obvious gifts of synesthetic awareness. 
Moved by the landscape, deeply responsive to 
both the place and its people, he was unable 
to utilize his sensual knowing without guilt, to 
unlock more fully the secrets of the culture he 
studied. His desire to leave the field as soon as 
possible can certainly be better understood 
when one comprehends the incredible tensions 
he wrestled with. Unable to reconcile his fan­
tasies with his image of himself as a scientist, 
he suffered. One can only wonder about the 
ways in which his work suffered, as well. 
Mariana Torgovnick, a writer and professor 
of English, has written compellin gly about the 
Western discourse on the primitive, or 'Other', 
asserting that it has often been a rhetoric of 
domination and of control. She offers a pene­
trating critique of a kind of arrogance which 
creeps through the thinking of the Western 
academic, who looks at the world as if the 
Western way is central, with everything else 
being considered 'non-Western' or derivative. 
Torgovnick argues that this rhetoric often 
hides what lies underneath: our more 'obscure 
desires: of sexual desires or fears ... masking 
the controller' s fear of losing control and 
power' {1990: 192). This, she asserts, allows 
the Western scholar 'to document the intimate 
lives of primitive peoples so that we can learn 
the truth about us -safely, as observers' 
{1990: 8). 
Regarding Malinowski, Torgovnick states 
that 'the need to forget bodies -his own 
included -is part and parcel of the kind of sci­
entific objectivity [he] sought' ( 1990: 230).10 
His disgust with the field (with himself?) 
emerged blatantly when he wrote, 'The life of 
the natives is utterly devoid of interest or 
importance, something as remote from me as 
the life of a dog' (1989: 167). This statement 
becomes even more disconcerting when one 
considers how moved he was by the field 
earlier in his stay, writing from a sophisticated 
level of synesthetic awareness. Yet, because 
he was denied a way to cope with his sexual 
fantasies, he censored rigorously, corseting 
himself into a narrow view of the place and its 
inhabitants. It is my belief that this could not 
help but weaken both his work, and himself, 
in the process; a high price to pay for being 
'objective' . Torgovnick vigorously defends Mali­
nowski's passions, boldly stating that 'We 
should savor his unprofessional desires' (1990: 
227), and calls for a 'rhetoric of desire, ulti­
mately more interesting, which implicates "us" 
in the "them" we try to conceive as the Other' 
( 1990: 245). This progressive viewpoint makes 
good sense when one considers that we are 
biologically wired to operate on multiple 
levels, possessing the capacity to use our 
bodies, hearts, and minds together to funnel 
and to interpret massive amounts of stimulus. 
By contextualizing our erotic responses and 
channeling them into the ethnographic 
endeavor , we might better represent those we 
study and claim to know. We would do this by 
fleshing out our accounts of people and places, 
openly bringing our own passions and insights 
to the task and articulating them in our textual 
represen tations. 11 
What is particularly interesting to me about 
the Malinowski debate is not the fact that he 
lusted for the women he studied at certain very 
human moments, but the fact that the revela­
tion that he did so triggered such an uproar in 
the anthropological community. This speaks 
clearly to the somewhat unbelievably repressed 
state the discipline (and its inhabitants) existed 
in and, I would contend, continue to exist in. 
What were they thinking? That Malinowski 
would be far from home, steeped in a foreign 
and exotic culture for a long period of time, 
and be dead as a sensual being? The fact that 
his private journals were seized upon -as if 
they, too, should have been strictly scholarly 
and scientific in their contents -attests to the 
denial that the field operates in, its residents 
sublimat ed in the ubiquitous voyeuristic frenzy 
of uncovering someone else's secrets while 
affecting an emotional distance from their 
expenence. 
Defining Sex in the Field: 
What Is It, Anyway? 
This brings us to another problem, which 
involves the defining of sex in the field. The 
traditional stance in American culture holds 
that sex has occurred when penetration -
preferably leading to male orgasm-has hap­
pened. Do we, as anthropologists, want to 

100 KATE ALTORK 
restrict ourselves to that notion? If one 
becomes infatuated with someone in the field, 
or has a flirtatious fling with them that stops 
at deep kissing or intense longing, does that 
mean that sex didn't occur? Further, does that 
mean that it did? 
The analogy of sex in the 1950s and early 
1960s might be useful here. It is a well-known 
fact that in those years 'good girls' didn't go 
'all the way'. While it was commonly under­
stood that many 'good girls' were, in fact, 
'doing it', the etiquette of the day called for 
energetic denial. Thus, the 'good girls' who 
were 'doing it' were lying about it, which made 
them apparently morally and socially superior 
to the 'bad girls' who were both 'doing it' and 
telling the truth. The irony here is obvious. 
And for the girls who didn't go 'all the way', 
but went 'almost all the way', one could argue 
that by privileging such a small part of the sex 
act (penetration), we bypass the obvious fact 
that the ones who went 'all the way' at least 
weren't pretending that they weren't 'doing 
anything'. 
An anthropologist I met once told me about 
a 'flirtation' she had with a male informant, 
hastening to add that 'We never actually had 
intercourse, but it certainly got intense there 
for a while!' When pressed, she admitted that 
the encounter was 'certainly sexual', but 
pointed out that she had later reminded the 
man of her role as an anthropologist and his 
as the 'informant', as if somehow by so doing 
she could erase what had transpired between 
them. Her inability to contextualize her own 
feelings resulted, I would contend, in a messy 
situation in which she attempted to justify her 
actions, while struggling to find a logical way 
out of a mess she hadn't yet been able to 
acknowledge to herself, a difficult state of 
affairs to unravel, to say the least. Pressed 
further, she confessed that the man had been 
both confused and angry with her, prompting 
her to blurt out, 'I guess I didn't know what I 
was doing, did I? I thought I was being a good 
professional by calling a halt to it.' 
This particular anthropologist was con­
cerned that if anyone were to find out she had 
developed a sexual interest in an informant, 
her work would be discredited. She felt forced 
to hide her experience in order to protect 
herself and, in so doing, became unable to analyze or to understand her own experience. 
An accomplished professional with a long list 
of publications to her credit, she will admit pri­
vately to 'involvements' with people in the 
field, while protecting herself publicly by 
claiming that her work is objective and 
unaffected by her personal feelings. 
What are we afraid of? Do we make the 
assumption that an anthropologist who 
becomes sensually or sexually involved in the 
field can no longer think straight? I would 
contend that all relationships and events with 
which we are involved in the field change us in 
subtle ways and affect the way we perceive, 
and write about, the field. Does the anthro­
pologist who plays at being 'objective' really 
create superior work to the one who immerses 
himself or herself in the field wholehearted ly? 
I am not advocating random and meaningless 
sexual encounters here, nor am I talking about 
situations where issues of colonialism and 
power imbalance enter into the discourse, 
which may be, in fact, most of the time. 
But anthropologists today increasingly work 
in field situations where they operate collabo­
ratively with so-called 'informants' (often 
called collaborators, in recent years) who are 
not inferior in terms of status or power. To 
hold on to the shield of 'neutral objectivity' in 
such situations, protecting oneself from being 
'touched' by the field, might be unnecessary in 
certain circumstances. The validity and sanc­
tioning of relationships which are not abusive 
and which are mutually desired need to be 
explored as possibilities, for what they might 
teach us about ourselves and our ethnographic 
endeavors. In order to engage in such a dia­
logue, as a discipline, it is critical that we step 
out from our hiding places and explore our 
feelings and beliefs. 
The point is not to encourage sensationalis­
tic, National Enquirer-type confessionals from 
the field, replete with descriptive close-ups and 
minute details about how a given anthropolo­
gist had sex in the field. But we might at least 
acknowledge that we 'did it' if we did (or that 
we wanted to 'do it', even if we didn't) and be 
open to the fertile possibilities for dialogue 
about the ways in which 'it' changed, 
enhanced, or detracted from what we felt, wit­
nessed, and interpreted in the field. In a disci­
pline where such encounters have taken place, 

THE EROTIC DIMENSION OF THE FIELDWORK EXPERIENCE 101 
and have been kept, for the most part, in the 
realm of 'underground' stories or anecdotes, it 
is striking to consider how long the consider­
ation of such relationships has been avoided 
and repressed by the discipline. 
It may be that the pose of objectivity in the 
field is no more than another version of the 
folk tale about the emperor with no clothes. 
As anthropologists, we would do well to 
remember that we are all naked at times in the 
field -if not physically , then certainly emo­
tionally. Therefore, despite our intellectual 
armor, we are inevitably somewhat open and 
vulnerable. And if it is true that the emperor 
really has no clothes on, then perhaps we 
should just stare openly at him, in the way of 
children, and see what he looks like. After all, 
it's just a body. And we might learn something. 
Sexy Business: Immersion 
in the Field 
The Warm Springs fire camp, an instant com­
munity constructed to meet the basic needs of 
1,100 firefighters and support personnel, 
existed for sixteen days in August of 1992. 
Operating smoothly through hot, dry days and 
cold, sometimes snowy nights, it moved to its 
own rhythms under glaring sun or dangling 
stars, wrapped in the smells of pine and smoke. 
Huge generators provided electricity for light 
and cooking fuel in the camp, while semi­
trucks housing portable showers gave weary 
firefighters a means to rid themselves of soot 
and sweat. Kitchens turned out hot, full-course 
meals three times a day and snack stations 
were located throughout the camp. The tele­
phone company was brought in to hook up 
telephones, enabling those on site to connect 
with the outside world -to phone home. 
Portable sinks stood near the showers, 
equipped with mirrors and toiletry stands. 
While there were only approximately thirty 
females in the camp (and they were given sep­
arate showering and sleeping facilities), male 
and female firefighters and support personnel 
mingled socially with one another, moving 
from the showers to the sinks where the men 
shaved and men and women alike combed hair 
and engaged in friendly banter. Under large, portable canopies, meals were 
taken and an ambience of warmth and cama­
raderie prevailed. At the long tables, it was not 
uncommon to see the sports pages handed 
from man to man 12 as each finished reading it, 
a gesture both friendly and surprisingly 
intimate, infusing the space with a quality of 
homelike domesticity. Throughout the camp, 
quonset huts provided sheltered stations for 
weather forecasting and map making, tool and 
equipment cleaning and dispersal, first aid 
assistance, strategy planning meetings, and the 
filing of disability insurance claims. A portable 
commissary dispensed razor blades and long 
johns, toothbrushes and shampoo, and T­
shirts which proclaimed, 'Warm Springs Fire 
Camp -1992'. At one end of the camp were 
the sleeping grounds, where large tents housed 
as many as twenty sleepers and small tents 
served those who preferred privacy. 13 Paths 
between tents were lit with ground lights, 
which gave the area a glowing, dreamlike 
quality at night. Men and women stood 
around smudge pots after dark when the tem­
peratures plunged, talking and warming their 
hands over an electrical, high-tech version of 
the traditional campfire. 
During the day, the sounds of heavy machin­
ery filled the air as helicopters, buses, trucks, 
and cars brought firefighters on and off the fire 
lines some fifteen miles away from camp. 
Competing with that of the generators for air­
space, the noise was intense and omnipresent. 
This was in sharp contrast to the late evenings 
when, after nightfall, people sat in groups 
telling stories and laughing, walked the paths 
in the sleeping areas, or slept noiselessly in 
their tents after long, grueling days on the 
line. 
My response to this environment was imme­
diate and clear. Intense and complex, it was 
one of the most engaging environments I had 
ever worked in and I couldn't get enough of it. 
My senses were hit with a constant onslaught 
of sounds and sights, smells and tastes. Sparks 
flew off shovels being sharpened for use on the 
line the next day. The smell of chicken and 
potatoes drifted from the cooking quarters. 
Machinery and voices, mixed with the rapid 
pace of motion in a place where the mission is 
the reason for its very existence -it was an 
intoxicating little world within the world, far 

102 KATE ALTORK 
from the realities of day-to-day life away from 
fires. 
Unlike Malinowski's, my more progressive 
training for the field allowed me to relish the 
life of the senses while there. My graduate 
training, as well as my readings and writings 
on the anthropolo gy of place, gave me a suit­
able context in which to house my own expe­
riences.14 Consequently, I was able to immerse 
myself sensually in this new environment, 
feeling my way into a growing understanding. 
In the Warm Springs fire camp, I found 
myself in a very sensual world where the body 
meets one of the most powerful natural ele­
ments known to humankind -fire. In attempt­
ing to analyze what it was about this particular 
place that made it so sensual and intriguing, 
despite the military-like uniforms and the 
ubiquitous heat and dust, I turned to some of 
the fire personnel for answers. Regarding the 
most direct displays of sexuality, one woma� 
had this to say: 
I'll tell you, after five days men get horny as 
hell and they will proposition anything they 
think they can bed. We call them fireline 
romances� You're very tight with people and 
shut off from the outside world. 
It was this woman's opinion that such encoun­
ters were to be expected in situations where 
people are working closely with one another 
and are far from home. This is not to say that 
sexual activity is either condoned or common­
place in the firecamp setting. Indeed, official 
US Forest Service policy dictates that firefight­
ers and support personnel refrain from engag­
ing in sexual activity with one another. 
Further , policies are set in place which are 
designed to deal with accusations of sexual 
harassment, and the people I spoke with 
seemed to feel that little, if any (depending 
upon whom one asked), outright sexual 
contact took place in the fire camps. 
As for the males, there were a number of 
men with whom I spoke who alluded to the 
fact that women 'came on' to them after days 
of working together. If men were 'coming on' 
to other men (or women propositioning other 
women) in that environment, such activities 
remained resolutely hidden in the recesses of 
an institution which reflects the military's 
strong homophobic predisposition. 15 What is critical here, however , is the fact 
that men and women were working together 
for long periods of time, engaged in activities 
which they found meaningful in a way that 
was defined by their collective goal -in this 
case, putting out fires -and that these kinds of 
human engagement are sexy by definition. I 
often saw small clusters of people laughing or 
talking together with a kind of intensity and 
mutual affection that is born out of such set­
tings, where life revolves around a clear 
purpose and people know that they are 
equipped to get the job done. 16 By their nature, 
then, these types of setting are erotically 
charged. The issue is not one of men and 
women, but one of human and human, 
working together in a setting where everyone 
matters and each action signifies. There are 
few activities engaged in by people in more 
ordinary environments which have the kind of 
stark coherence and clarity of mission that one 
witnesses in the fire camps. 
The similarities between people in a fire 
camp and anthropo logists, who develop bonds 
with the people they study when immersed in 
a community far from home, can be teased out 
here quite readily. Moreover , in the case of the 
fire camps one can add to the mix the element 
of danger. One officer put it succinctly when 
he said, 'It's hazardous country, they're haz­
ardous trees. It's hard to fight fire here. Fire 
fighters can get hurt. And, in the worst case 
scenario, they can die.' Therefore, these people 
work in an almost continual state of height­
ened physiolo gical arousal. One woman said: 
You're on a constant adrenaline high because 
you have something important to do and you 
have to do it right away and then you go back 
to the camp and you crash. But it's a nice 
crash, because it's all encompassing. When I 
get bored on my regular job, I tell my boss, 'I 
need a fire to go to I' 
Firefighters, who often refer to themselves 
proudly as 'fire bums' (in reference to their 
willingness to drop everything to 'go to a fire'), 
seem to thrive on an adrenaline-induced state 
of vigilance and energy that the fire situation 
fosters. This arousal state was palpable and I 
found myself responding to it by bringing a 
different quality of intensity to my own work 
in the camp. 

THE EROTIC DIMENSION OF THE FIEL DWORK EXPERIENCE 103 
There is also a quality of ownership regard­
ing the forest environment and the fire that is 
sexy in its expression. Firefighters often refer, 
almost possessively, to 'my fire', or 'my baby' 
(in reference to the fire itself), using a language 
of passionate attachment when they describe 
their commitment to the work they are doing. 
For me, this unremitting and focused attention 
to the task at hand had an extremely erotic 
quality to it, like a lover whose eyes remain 
fixed on my face during the act of lovemaking. 
And this attachment is not just a solitary con­
nection between an individual and the land. 
There is a collabor ative, interdependent 
quality about the firefighters' activities which 
is moving to witness. One man articulated it 
this way: 
There's only us to take care of us here. And 
so people, being the creatures we are, tend to 
stick together and while we can be extremely 
independent, we also need, I think, that other 
human contact . . . and that reassurance that 
there are other people there working toward 
the same thing. So we go to other people for 
support even though they are relative 
strangers. 
The vulnerability and need to connect with 
others expressed here add to the elements 
which come together to create a sense of place 
that is warm and inviting, yet crackling with 
excitement and potential danger. While there 
were occasions when I witnessed what 
appeared to be active flirting -three men 
laughingly throwing a cream pie on the shirt 
of a beautiful, blonde-ha ired woman (a cohort 
from the same management team), for 
instance, and her teasing, easy response 17 -
some of the most sensual behavior in the camp 
took place between the lines. One could 
witness it in the silent sharing of tasks, the 
looks of respect and admiration that passed 
from one person to another when progress was 
made, the way in which camp inhabitants 
shared small spaces in the easy manner of 
those who feel safe and familiar with their 
companions because they all know what 
they're doing and share the same goals. 
Nor is this dynamic confined to cross-gender 
interactions. The warmth and connectedness 
fostered by common purpose in a charged 
environment operated palpably between men, as well as between women. Back-patting, the 
tousling of hair, an arm thrown casually 
around a shoulder -these means of physical 
contact bespoke camaraderie, mutual respect, 
and friendliness in a setting where teamwork 
is the name of the game. Like the butt-slapping 
of football players in the NFL, these small 
physical acts which transpire between team 
mates signify 'insiderness' and connectedness 
in unique circumstances comprehended fully 
only by those on the 'inside' .18 
For an anthropologist to enter such an envi­
ronment and operate solely by asking ques­
tions and recording them on tape would be to 
miss the point. Some of my clearest insights 
into camp dynamics came while walking the 
paths in the sleeping areas at night, listening 
to the 'feel' of the place. Despite the codified 
and prescribed external structure of the US 
Forest Service fire system, there was a sense of 
expansiveness and softness that seemed to per­
meate the overall experience. In other words, 
the subtleties about what makes a given envi­
ronment tick often go on in the spaces between 
the work and the words. By opening to the 
senses, I was able to move closer to the 
nuances of the place, and to sense irs meaning 
to those who inhabited it. By immersing myself 
in the field, I began to understand this small 
subculture from the inside out, rather than 
from the outside (by way of the intellect) in, 
'feeling the field' with my body and heart, as 
well as with my brain. 
Perhaps it was in this frame of mind that 
anthropologist Paul Rabinow had one of his 
most sensual encounters during his early field­
work in Morocco. His account of making love 
to a woman from another village during a day 
off from fieldwork has been written about and 
scrutinized for years by other anthropolo­
gists.19 This account is fascinating to me, not 
for what it reveals about his sexual behavior, 
but for his description of what led up to the 
sexual event itself. For it is here in his account 
that he describes how he left his fieldsite for a 
couple of days, let his guard down, and began 
to respond openly to his surroundin gs with the 
sensibility of the synesthete. He wrote, 'It was 
a beautiful, cloudless day, and we drove joy­
ously away from Sefrou [the fieldwork site] 
into the mountain areas' (1977: 63). He goes 
on to say, 'As we left the highway, town, and 

104 KATE ALTORK 
society behind, I felt a mounting excitement, 
as if personal inhibitions and social conven­
tions were also being left behind.' He admit­
ted then: 'I had never before had this kind of 
sensual interaction in Morocco' (1977: 65). 
The heart of his problem as a self-defined 
objective 'scientist' is then revealed, as he con­
tinues: 'Although it was incredibly welcome it 
seemed too good to be true. Haunting super­
ego images of my anthropologist persona 
thickened my consciousness as the air became 
purer and the play freer ... I felt wondrously 
happy -it was the best single day I was to 
spend in Morocco'(1977: 65). This is a remark­
able statement, in the sense that it leads one to 
question how he was recording his notions 
about the people and place he studied before 
he opened to the fuller use of his own senses. 
Shut off from the deeper part of himself, 
restricted -as Malinowski perceived himself to 
be -to the role of voyeur and recorder, he 
deprived himself of aspects of his own sensual 
awareness as a potent data source. 
This is all the more interesting in the light 
of his confession that the sexual event itself 
was anticlimactic for him. What really moved 
him was his ability to let his guard down and 
open up to the sensuality of the weather and 
his female companions. 'Here we were, after 
an absolutely splendid romp through the 
mountains, sitting down next to some sulphur 
springs, and they were going swimming', he 
exults (1977: 67). Of the sex itself, he wrote 
somberly, 'Aside from the few pillows and 
charcoal burner for tea, there was only the 
bed. The warmth and non-verbal communica­
tion of the afternoon were fast disappearing. 
This woman was not impersonal, but she was 
not that affectionate or open either. The after­
noon had left a much deeper impression on 
me' (1977: 69). In other words, when the 
visual and sensual elements were altered, and 
he was face to face with a woman with whom 
he had no true emotional connection -in a 
meager environment far removed from the 
sensual joy he had experienced earlier that day 
-the act of lovemaking was internalized as a 
diminishing act by comparison. 
This statement is courageous, in my view, in 
that it not only breaks down the myth that 
sensual pleasure must culminate in sexual 
intercourse, but also highlights emphatically the idea that the anthropologists can make a 
conscious choice about how to conduct them­
selves if they understand their own sensual 
experiences and can put them in perspective. 
Perhaps Rabinow might not have chosen to 
make love with the woman if he had under­
stood the nature of his own intense experience 
that day. Having no way to contextualize his 
feelings and responses, he carried through to 
the logical -although perhaps unnecessary -
conclusion. Having sex while in the field is not 
something one can decide clearly upon if one 
is unaware of the sources of desire and alter­
native ways of handling those desires. 
Words Melting on the 
Page: Writing the Erotic 
into the Text 
My own fieldnotes from the firecamp days are 
peppered with sensual and sexual references: 
8/16/92 The sounds of helicopters and heavy 
machinery move in me in a rhythmic way. 
I wonder what it would be like to make love 
in a helicop ter. One man, one woman, and 
one engine ... an intriguing triangle. 
8/19/92 These people live in a world so ele­
mental -in the grip of fickle weather patterns, 
at the mercy of the wind. Everything is about 
basic needs here: food, water, 'sleeping place, 
work. They work on the edge, reduced to 
focusing on the moment at hand as they con­
front fire. It seems to give them a directness 
and rhe ability to listen cannily and acutely -
like forest animals -that is almost primitive. 
It's very seductive. 
8/22/92 No one here is distracted by furniture 
or decor, by superficial tasks or by social 
niceties. It's pared down and lean, a world 
where words and acts are measured and chan­
neled directly into the work. The quality of 
silence is intensely erotic, as if anything you 
say -any sound you might make -carries 
with it deep meaning. They listen with the 
rapt attention of the lover who doesn't want 
to miss anything, who is tuned to the nuanced. 
_ It's almost overwhelming at times. 
In attempting to translate the field experi­
ence onto the virginal, blank, white page, I am 

THE EROTIC DIMENSION OF THE FIELDWORK EXPERIENCE 105 
filled with ambivalence. What will my col­
leagues think if I put sexual fantasies in a 
chapter like this? I visualize myself reading a 
professional paper, standing in front of a large 
room full of anthropologists. Suddenly, 
someone shouts out, 'So, do you really think 
ies OK to have sex when you're working?' 
Another voice rings out aggressively, 'So, 
you're condoning sex in the field? How unpro­
fessional. How could you?' And the feminists 
... all this talk about men and erotic attrac­
tions. Where is the evidence of my twenty 
years of feminist self-identification here, 
hidden behind talk of macho machinery and 
locking eyes with male strangers? 
If I'm going to write about sex, I tell myself, 
perhaps I'd better at least protect myself with 
some scholarly armor. Maybe I should retreat 
behind the cool, gray wall of academic lan­
guage·, haul out some big words. I could throw 
in a few of the top-ten favorites of the earnest 
anthropologist, for instance -problematize 
... metacommunication ... de con struct ion. 
Margaret Mead (1972) once wrote of how 
troublesome Reo Fortune's ( 1963) passion­
ately written account of the Dobuans became 
over rime, fostering suspicion from many of his 
anthropological colleagues about the validity 
of his work. His immersion in the world of the 
sorcerer, and his choice of writing about it in 
a lively and subjective way, weren't considered 
appropriate by those who expected work pro­
duced solely from the precisely analytical part 
of his mind (Mead 1972: 184; cf. Cesara 1982: 
136). As Cesara accurately points out, 'He [the 
practtcmg anthropologist] cannot escape 
passion, and yet he is not able to claim it as 
central to his knowledge' (1982: 100). There­
fore, one is left with the impression that it's 
bad enough he had to feel it (passion, the heat 
of the field), but even worse that he couldn't 
keep it out of his writing (poor boundaries, 
bad judgment). 
But there are others in recent years who see 
it differently. Paul Stoller (1989), for instance, 
speaks movingly about his long-time commit­
ment to one particular place and its people, in 
one of his writings about the Songhay of Niger. 
'In 1969 my senses were tuned to otherness 
... my senses of taste, smell, hearing, and sight 
entered into Nigerian settings', he wrote. 'Now I let the sights, sounds, smells, and tastes of 
Niger flow into me' (1989: 5). By not restrict­
ing himself to the Western 'gaze', which he 
refers to as the 'privileged sense of the West' 
(1989: 5), he was able to produce a represen­
tation of a people and their lives that is vital, 
rich, and alive. 
Stoller calls on the anthropologist to move 
beyond the dry and impoverished language of 
traditional academic writing, in order to give 
the reader what he calls 'the taste of ethno­
graphic things'. This, he contends, can be done 
by writing ethnographies which attend to the 
sensual aspects of the field, ethnographies that 
'will render our accounts of others more faith­
ful to the realities of the field -accounts which 
will then be more, rather than less, scientific' 
(1989: 9). By allowing ourselves to be pene­
trated by the field, with all of the dissonance 
that may elicit, we might 'walk along our soli­
tary paths in the field, exposing our heans 
so full of excitement, fear, and doubt' ( 1989: 
54-5). 
It is important to note that Stoller is not sug­
gesting that we relinquish the 'objective' data 
at our disposal, nor that we lapse into experi­
mental forms of representation that render 
understanding difficult, if not impossible. 20 
Rather, he contends that the anthropologist 
can choose to work from a place of vulnera­
bility and acceptance of the emotional and 
intellectual dissonance which is part and parcel 
of the process of trying to come to 'know' a 
place and irs people. It was the understanding 
of this dissonance which allowed me to inte­
grate and to interpret my sexual fantasies and 
sensual reveries as a normal pan of the field­
work process, and therefore to set the limits 
that kept me from acting on them, particularly 
when tempted by the golden arms of a hand­
some firefighter . 
Working from this place of vulnerability and 
acceptance can give the reader 'the taste of 
ethnographic things', Stoller asserts, with 
'filmic or narrative images: the smells, the 
tastes, the sounds, the colors -lyrical and 
unsettling -of the land' (1989: 156). By so 
doing, we might enable the reader to sense 
what it is like to live in a certain place without 
having to pretend that we have mastered a 
culture intellectually while maintaining a 
detachment from it emotionally . 

106 KATE ALTORK 
Outside of the academy, it is a well-known 
fact that there are those who accuse academic 
writers of 'linguistic constipation'21 or of being 
'out of touch' with the 'real' world. The phrase 
'out of touch' is particularly apt here, as it 
reflects the sentiment that there are those who 
cannot 'feel' the writing of academics who stay 
hidden behind a language form that, by its 
nature, is inaccessible to many. 
This is a double-edged issue, it seems. We 
need to ask, first of all, whether we want to 
study a culture in a calculating, solely intellec­
tual way, and then -when we turn to the task 
of bringing the culture to others -whether 
those whom we study would want to be rep­
resented in that way. Finally, if I dared, I would 
ask: who would want to read such an account? 
How many papers and articles have anthro­
pologists read or listened to over the years 
from which every ounce of sensual and emo­
tional content had previously been bled in the 
name of credibility?22 Do we really have to 
avoid lyrical description, subjectivity, and the 
personal voice in order to hold our place in the 
line-up of respected social scientists ? Cesara, 
in a letter to a loved one, articulated her view 
clearly: 
Deep inside of me something tells me that art 
and science are one ... What happens to a 
man who sits outside his cage of rats and 
experiments on them? Does the interaction 
between these men and rats nor affect the 
scientist? I think it does. I think such a scien­
tist's view of the human condition becomes 
simplified� often deterministic: in some 
instances he loses all sense of the individual' s 
wholesomeness, freedom, responsibility, and 
djgnity. (1982: 193) 
When it's all said and done, it seems to come 
down to a question of whether we work and 
write from the head or from the heart. And it 
is here where the logical compromise emerges. 
Is it not possible to forge an amalgam of the 
two, in which we allow ourselves to be 
immersed as sensual beings in each phase of 
the ethnographic endeavor, from project plan­
ning to final textual representation, while 
simultaneously employing our capacities to 
analyze and to reason? I believe that this is not 
only realistic, but is a highly beneficial way to 
conduct the anthropological enterprise. By accepting ourselves as sensual -and yes, sexual 
-beings, we might harness all of our collective 
intellectu al and sensory capacities for use in 
both the work itself and the written product 
created from it. 
Erotics and the Field: 
Making Love to One's Self 
So, where does this leave us? Do we make love 
in the field or don't we? And, if we do, how 
far do we go? How can we untangle the web 
of moral and ethical issues involved and 
explore� as well, the dissonance between the 
unspoken rules of the academy and our own 
personal beliefs and actions? When I say, for 
instance, that some of the best lovemaking I 
have yet experienced with my husband took 
place on my return home between forays into 
the world of the firefighters, does that trivial­
ize or cheapen what we shared together? I 
would contend that the opening of my senses, 
in an environment which was passionately 
compelling, created a heightened level of 
awareness in me which served to bring me 
closer to myself. And it is that connection to 
self which allowed me to blend the images of 
smoke and helicopters, hard work and attach­
ment to others, and which I then brought most 
advantageously to the marital bed. 
Looking at field photos from that time, I 
notice that my face looks radiant, as women 
(and, sometimes, men) often look when they 
fall in love or become passionate about their 
work. My powerful attraction to the firefight­
ers and to the world they dwell in excited me 
in a way that seems to have attached me more 
firmly not only to them, but to myself. In the 
way that the act of masturbation is a self­
absorbed act which forms a dosed circle 
between the individual and her or his own 
body, so the field experience can function in 
similar fashion. When the anthropologist 
works with an open heart and mind, allowing 
the senses to operate freely, an erotic place is 
created between the anthropologist and the 
place she or he studies. Undisrupted by the 
complexities of the 'outside world', the anthro­
pologist has a rare opportunity to learn about 
the so-called 'Other' by learning to know more 

THE EROTiC-DIMENSION OF THE FIELDWORK EXPERIENCE 107 
about the self, with few expectations or dis­
tractions from the 'outside'. 
In the fire camp, my very presence as a soli­
tary female from the 'outside' was provocative, 
inducing specific sensual verbal and nonverbal 
responses from certain men. Golde ( 1986: 6) 
states that the very accessibility of the woman 
fieldworker can be considered provocative. In 
my particular situation, I came and went freely 
in the field, a fact that was widely registered 
by those whom I studied. Striding around the 
grounds, eating meals with the firefighters, I 
moved in and out of their living and sleeping 
environment in an obvious way. With so few 
women on site, I was a highly visible presence. 
As a result, I became more visible to myself -
as a female - over time. Having my gender 
reflected so consistently by those with whom I 
came in contact brought me ultimately to a 
point where I became more aware of myself as 
a gendered being. This may be one of the most 
distinct and unnoticed advantages of the field­
work endeavor: the opportunity to know the 
self better, particularly in terms of gender con­
siderations, by seeing oneself reflected in the 
eyes of others. 
Steeped in one's own senses, the boundary 
between self and other might slowly blur at 
times (see Geertz 1983 ). And while noticing 
difference, we might be able to feel-from the 
innermost part of ourselves -the power of sim­
ilarity. For while the use of the word 'other' 
serves to separate us from other people, it is 
also likely that it separates us, in subtle ways, 
from ourselves. If it is true that our senses 
work synesthetically, in what Hiss calls 'simul­
taneous perception' (1990: 4), is it not possi­
ble that we are more connected to those we 
study than we might sometimes like to admit? 
Perhaps, by repressing our sensual feelings or 
sexual urges, we maintain a distance that -in 
the end -does a disservice to the sensitive 
work we claim to do as cultural recorders and 
mterpreters. 
Perhaps by acknowledging our own feelings 
and desires, we might actually look at other 
people and places more objectively, by being 
able to ferret out our own biases and distor­
tions as we do our work. Hiss suggests that 
those who attempt to come to know a place 
should utilize simultaneous perception for just 
that reason. Bringing all of the senses to the task in this way 'helps us experience our sur­
roundings and our reactions to them, and not 
just our own thoughts and desires' ( 1990: 4 ). 
Unlike Malinowski, who was forced perhaps 
to dislike those whom he studied in a sturdy 
effort to propel himself away from his own 
overwhelming sensual feelings, we might then 
be open to interpreting from a more centered, 
stable vantage point. With the energy con­
served by not having to fight our hormones or 
our fantasies, we could perhaps better grasp an 
inhabited landscape in a sensual, but more 
fully accurate, way. 
To be permeated by a place - truly to feel its 
heart beat - is both a gift and the primary 
fringe benefit of the work that we do. To 
respond to that place and its inhabitants 
without holding back, and to represent them 
fully in the spirit of generosity and abundance, 
is the way we might return the favor. 
On the last day of the fire project, I stand 
under a large ponderosa pine with two fire­
fighters, protected from the direct glare of the 
midday sun. They express gratitude that I 
thought enough about what they do for a 
living to have given over a chunk of my own 
time to come and 'check it out'. Thanking 
them for their feedback, I ask if I might take a 
picture of the two of them under the tree. 'You 
know, end of fire -exhausted, but victorious 
firefighters prepare to return home', I intone in 
the voice of the television newscas ter. Laugh­
ing, one of the men amiably throws an arm 
over his companion' s shoulder , preparing to 
pose. But the other one objects, 'Hey, wait! I'm 
covered with soot, and my clothes are filthy. 
Wouldn't you rather get your shot after I clean 
up, so you can see how handsome I really am?' 
He sticks an elbow into his buddy's ribs for 
emphasis. 
But the other man shakes his head and, 
turning to his friend, says this: 'What do you 
mean? This is how we look out there, man! 
This is what it's all about-men and machines, 
sweat and grit. Why wash it off?' Turning to 
me, his face opening into the grin of the heart­
breaker , he adds, 'Hey, Katie, this is the way it 
really is, right? It's hot and heavy work. But, 
what the heck, it's kind of sexy, don't you 
think?' And then, looking me full in the face, 
he winked. And I winked back.
