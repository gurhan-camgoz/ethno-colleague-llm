.. When do you think you'll be back?" I asked 
Milagros six months later� handing him the 
letter I had written to Father Coriolano at the 
mission. In it I briefly notified him that I 
intended to stay for at least two more months 
with the Iticoteri. 1 asked him to inform my 
friends in Caracas; and most important of all, 
I begged him to send with Milagros as many 
writing pads and pencils as he could spare . 
.. When will you be back?" I asked again. 
.. ln two weeks or so," Milagros said casu­
ally, fitting the letter into his bamboo quiver. 
He must have detected the anxiousness in my 
face for he added, "There is no way to tell, but 
I'll be back." 
1 watched as he started down the path 
leading to the river . He adjusted the quiver on 
his back, then turned to me briefly, his move­
ments momentarily arrested as though there 
were something he wished to say. Instead he 
lifted his hand to wave good-bye. 
Slowly I headed back to the shabono, 
passing several men felling trees next to the gardens. Carefully I stepped around the logs 
cluttered all over the cleared patch, making 
sure not to cut my feet on the pieces of bark, 
chips, and slivers of wood buried amidst the 
dead leaves on the ground. 
"He'll be back as soon as the plantains are 
ripe," Etewa shouted, waving his hand the 
way Milagros had just done. "He won't miss 
the feast." 
Smiling, I waved back, wanting to ask when 
the feast would take place. I did not need to; 
he had already given me the answer: When the 
plantains were ripe. 
The brush and logs that were scattered each 
night in front of the main entrance of the 
shabono to keep out intruders had already 
been moved aside. It was still early, yet the huts 
facing the round, open clearing were mostly 
empty. Women and men were working in the 
nearby gardens or had gone into the forest to 
gather wild fruits, honey, and firewood. 
Armed with miniature bows and arrows, a 
group of little boys gathered around me. "See 
the lizard I killed," Sisiwe said, holding the 
dead animal by the tail.

A TRUE ADVENTU RE IN THE SOUTH AMERICAN JUNGLE 515 
"That's all he can do -shoot lizards," a boy 
in the group said mockingly , scratching his 
ankle with the toes of his other foot. ''And 
most of the time he misses." 
"I don't," Sisiwe shouted, his face turning 
red with rage. 
I caressed the stubbles on the crown of his 
head. In the sunlight his hair was not black but 
a reddish brown. Searching for the right words 
from my limited vocabulary, I hoped to assure 
him that one day he would be the best hunter 
in the settlement. 
Sisiwe, Ritimi's and Etewa 's son, was six, at 
the most seven, years old for he did not yet 
wear a pubic waist string. Ritimi, believing 
that the sooner a boy tied his penis against his 
abdomen the faster he would grow, had 
repeated ly forced the child to do so. But Sisiwe 
had refused, arguing that it hurt. Etewa had 
not insi�red. His son was growing healthy and 
strong. Soon, the father had argued, Sisiwe 
would realize that it was improper for a man 
to be seen without a waist string. Like most 
children, Sisiwe wore a piece of fragrant root 
tied around his neck, a charm against disease, 
and as soon as the designs on his body faded, 
he was painted anew with onoto. 
Smiling, his anger forgotten, Sisiwe held on 
to my hand and in one swift motion climbed 
up on me as if I were a tree. He wrapped his 
legs around my waist. He swung backward 
and, stretching his arms toward the sky, 
shouted, "Look how blue it is -the color of 
your eyes." 
From the middle of the clearing the sky 
seemed immense. There were no trees, lianas, 
or leaves to mar its splendor . The dense vegeta­
tion loomed outside the shabono, beyond the 
palisades of logs protecting the settlement. The 
trees appeared to bide their time, as if they knew 
they were only provisionally held in check. 
Tugging at my arm, the children pulled me 
together with Sisiwe to the ground. At first I 
had nor been able to associate them with any 
particular parent for they wandered in and out 
of the huts, eating and sleeping wherever it 
was convenient. I only knew where the babies 
belonged, for they were perennially hanging 
around their mother's bodies. Whether it 
was day or night, the infants never seemed 
disturbed, regardless of what activity their 
mothers were engaged in. I wondered how I would do without Mila­
gros. Each day he had spent several hours 
teaching me the language, customs, and beliefs 
of his people, which I eagerly recorded in my 
norepads. 
Learning who was who among the lticoteri 
proved to be most confusing. They never called 
each other by name, except when someone was 
to be insulted. Ritimi and Etewa were known 
as Mother and Father of Sisiwe and Texoma. 
{It was permissible to use children's names, but 
as soon as they reached puberty everyone 
refrained from it.) Matters were further com­
plicated in that males and females from a given 
lineage called each other brother and sister; 
males and females from another lineage were 
referred to as brother-in-law and sister-m-law. 
A male who married a woman from an eligi­
ble lineage called all the women of that lineage 
wives, bur did not have sexual contact with 
them. 
Milagros often pointed out that it was nor 
only I who had to adapt. The lticoreri were JUSt 
as baffled by my odd behavior; to them I was 
neither woman, man, or child, and as such 
they did nor quire know what to think of me 
or where they could fir me in. 
Old Hayama emerged from her hur. In a 
high-pitched vmce she told rhe children to 
leave me alone. "Her stomach is sri II empty," 
she said. Purring her arm around my waist, she 
led me to the hearth in her hut. 
Making sure not to step on or collide with 
any of rhe aluminum and enamel cooking pots 
(acquired through trade with other settle­
ments), the tortoise shells, gourds, and baskets 
scattered on rhe ground, I sat across from 
Hayama. I extended my legs fully, in the way 
of rhe Iricoreri women, and scratching the head 
of her pet parrot, I waited for the food. 
''Eat," she said, handing me a baked plan­
rain on a broken calabash. Attenrively the old 
woman watched as I chewed with my mouth 
open, smacking my lips repeatedly. She smiled, 
content that I was fully appreciating the soft 
sweet plantain. 
Hayama had been introduced to me by 
Milagros as Angelica's sister. Every time 1 
looked at her I tried to find some resemblance 
to the frail old woman 1 had lost in the forest. 
About five feet four, Hayama was tall for an 
Iticoteri woman. Not only was she physically 

516 FLORINDA DONNER 
different from Angelica, but she did not have 
her sister's lighmess of spirit. There was a 
harshness to Hayama's voice and manner that 
often made me feel uncomfortable. And her 
heavy, drooping eyelids gave her face a pecu­
liarly sinister expression. 
"You stay here with me until Milagros 
returns," the old woman said, serving me 
another baked plantain. 
I stuffed the hot fruit in my mouth so I 
would not have to answer. Milagros had intro­
duced me to his brother-in-law Arasuwe, who 
was the headman of the Iticoteri, as well as to 
the other members of the settlement. However , 
it was Ritimi who, by hanging my hammock 
in the hut she shared with Etewa and their two 
children, had made it known that I belonged 
to her. "The white girl sleeps here," she had 
said to Milagros, explaining that little Texoma 
and Sisiwe would have their hammocks 
hung around Tutemi's hearth in the adjoining 
hut. 
No one had interfered with Ritimi's scheme. 
Silently, a smile of gentle mockery on his face, 
Etewa had watched as Ritim.i rushed between 
their hut and Tutemi's, rearranging the ham­
mocks in the customary triangle around the 
fire. On a small loft built between the back 
poles supporting the dwelling, she placed my 
knapsack, amidst bark boxes, an assortment of 
baskets, an ax, and gourds with onoto, seeds, 
and roots. 
Ritimi's self-assuredness stemmed not only 
from the fact that she was the headman 
Arasuwe's oldest daughter -by his first wife, 
a daughter of old Hayama, now dead -and 
that she was Etewa's first and favorite wife, but 
also because Ritimi knew that in spite of her 
quick temper everyone in the shabono 
respected and liked her. 
"No more," I pleaded with Hayama as she 
took another plantain from the fire. "My belly 
is fulL" Pulling up my T-shirt, I pushed out my 
stomach so she could see how filled it looked. 
"You need to grow fat around your bones," 
the old woman said, mashing up the banana 
with her fingers. ''Your breasts are as small as 
a child's." Giggling, she pulled my T-shirt up 
further. "No man will ever want you-he'll be 
afraid to hurr himself on the bones." 
Opening my eyes wide in mock horror, I pre­
tended to gobble down the mush. "I'll surely get fat and beautiful eating your food," I said 
with my mouth full. 
Still wet from her river bath, Ritimi came 
into the hut combing her hair with a densely 
thistled pod. Sitting next to me, she put her 
arms around my neck and planted resounding 
kisses on my face. I had to restrain myself from 
laughing. The Iticoteri' s kisses tickled me. 
They kissed differently; each time they put 
their mouth against my cheek and neck they 
vibrated their lips while sonorously ejecting 
a1r. 
"You are not moving the whhe girl's 
hammock in here," Ritimi said, looking at her 
grandmother . The certainty of her tone was 
not matched by the inquiring softness of her 
dark eyes. 
Not wanting to be the cause of an argument, 
I made it clear that it did not make much dif­
ference where my hammock hung. Since there 
were no walls between the huts, we practically 
lived together. Hayama's hut stood on Tutemi's 
left, and on our right was Arasuwe the 
headman's, which he shared with his oldest 
wife and three of his smallest children. His 
other two wives and their respective offspring 
occupied adjacent huts. 
Ritimi fixed her gaze on me, a pleading 
expression in her eyes. "Milagros asked me to 
take care of you," she said, running the this­
tied pod through my hair, softly, so as not to 
scratch my scalp. 
After what seemed an interminable silence, 
Hayama finally said, "You can leave your 
hammock where it is, but you will eat here 
with me." 
It was a good arrangement, I thought. Etewa 
already had four mouths to feed. Hayama, on 
the other hand, was taken good care of by her 
youngest son. Judging by the amount of 
animal skulls and plantains hanging from the 
thatched palm roof, her son was a good hunter 
and cultivator. Other than the baked plantains 
eaten in the morning, there was only one meal, 
in the late afternoon, when families gathered 
together to eat. People snacked throughout the 
day on whatever was available - fruit, nuts, or 
such delicacies as roasted ants and grubs. 
Ritimi also seemed pleased with the eating 
arrangement. Smiling, she walked over to our 
hut, pulled down the basket she had given me, 
which was hanging above my hammock, then 

A TRUE ADVENTURE IN THE SOUTH AMERICAN JUNGLE 517 
took out my notepad and pencil. "Now let us 
work," she said in a commanding tone. 
In the days that followed Ritimi taught me 
about her people as Milagros had done for the 
past six months. He had set up a few hours each 
day for what I referred to as formal instruction. 
At first I had great difficulty in learning the 
language. Not only did I find it to be heavily 
nasal, but it was extremely difficult to under­
stand people when they talked with wads of 
tobacco in their mouths. I tried to devise some 
sort of a comparative grammar but give it up 
when I realized that not only did I not have 
the proper linguistic training, but the more I 
tried to be rational about learning their lan­
guage, the less I could speak. 
My best teachers were the children. 
Although they pointed things out to me and 
greatly' enjoyed giving. me words to repeat, 
they made no conscious effort to explain any­
thing. With them I was able to rattle on, totally 
uninhibited about making mistakes. After 
Milagros's departure, there was still much I did 
not comprehend, yet I was astonished by how 
well I managed to communi cate with others, 
reading correctly the inflection of their voices, 
the expression on their faces, and the eloquent 
movements of their hands and bodies. 
During those hours of formal instruction, 
Ritimi took me to visit the women in the dif­
ferent huts and I was allowed to ask questions 
to my heart's content. Baffled by my curiosity, 
the women talked freely, as if they were 
playing a game. They patiently explained again 
and again whatever I did not understand. 
I was grateful Milagros had set that prece­
dent. Not only was curiosity regarded as bad 
manners, but it went against their will to be 
questioned. Yet Milagros had lavishly indulged 
me in what he called my eccentric whim, 
stating that the more I knew about the lan­
guage and customs of the lticoteri, the quicker 
I would feel at home with them. 
It soon became apparent that I did not need 
to ask too many direct questions. Often the 
most casual remark on my part was recipro­
cated by a flow of information I would not 
have dreamed of eliciting. 
Each day, just before nightfall, aided by 
Ritimi and Tutemi, I would go over the data 
gathered during the day and try to order it under some kind of classificatory scheme such 
as social structure, cultural values, subsi stence 
techniques, and other universal categories of 
human social behavi or. 
However , to my great disappointment, there 
was one subject M.ilagros had not touched 
upon: shamanism. I had observed from my 
hammock two curing sessions, of which I had 
written detailed accounts. 
"Arasuwe is a great shapori, '' Milagros had 
said to me as I watched my first curing ritual. 
"Does he invoke the help of the spirits when 
he chants?" I asked as I watched Milagros's 
brother-in-law massage, suck, and rub the 
prostrate body of a child. 
Milagros had given me an outraged look. 
"There are things one doesn't talk about." He 
had gotten up abruptly and before walking out 
of the hut had added, "Don't ask about these 
things. If you do, you will run into serious 
trouble." 
I had not been surprised by his response, hut 
I had been unprepared for his outright anger. 
I wondered if his refusal to talk about the 
subject was because I was a woman or rather 
that shamanism was a taboo topic. l did not 
dare to find out at the time. Being a woman, 
white, and alone was precarious enough. 
I was aware that in most societies knowl­
edge regarding shamanistic and curing prac­
tices is never revealed except to the initiates. 
During Milagros's absence I did not mention 
the word shamanism once but spent hours 
deliberating over what would be the best war 
to learn about it without arousing any anger 
and suspicion. 
From my notes on the two sessions it 
became evident that the lticoteri belteved the 
shapori's body underwent a change when 
under the influence of the hallucinogenic snuff 
epena. That is, rhe shaman acted under the 
assumption that his human body transformed 
itself into a supernatural body. Thus he made 
contact with the spirits in the forest. My 
obvious approach would be to arrive at an 
understanding of shamanism via the body -
not as an object determined by psychochemi­
cal laws, holistic forces in nature, the environ­
ment, or the psyche itself, but through an 
understanding of the body as lived experience, 
the body as an expressive unity known 
through performance. 

518 FLORINDA DONNER 
Most studies on shamanism, including mine, 
have focused on the psychotherapeutic and 
social aspects of healing. I thought that my 
approach would not only provide a novel 
explanation but would furnish me with a way 
of learning about curing without becoming 
suspect. Questions concerning the body need 
not necessarily be associated with shamanism. 
I had no doubt that little by little I would 
retrieve the necessary data without the Irico­
teri ever being aware of what I was really after. 
Any pangs of conscience I felt regarding the 
dishonesty of my task were quickly stilled by 
repeating to myself that my work was impor­
tant for the understanding of non-Western 
healing practices. The strange, often bizarre 
customs of shamanism would become under­
standable in the light of a different interpreta­
tional context, thus furthering anthropological 
knowledge in general. 
"You haven't worked for two days," Ritimi 
said to me one afternoon. "You haven't asked 
about last night's songs and dances. Don't you 
know they are important? If we don't sing and 
dance the hunters will return without meat for 
the feast.,., Scowling, she threw the notepad 
into my lap. "You haven't even painted in your 
book.,., 
"I'm resting for a few days,,., I said, clutch­
ing the notepad against my breast as if it were 
the dearest thing I possessed. I had no inten­
tion of letting her know that every precious 
page was to be filled exclusively with data on 
shamanism. 
Ritimi took my hands in hers, examined 
them inrently, then, assuming a very serious 
expression, commented, "They look very tired 
-they need rest." 
We burst out laughing. Ritimi had always 
been baffled that I consider ed decorating my 
book to be work. To her work meant digging 
weeds in the garden, collecting firewood, and 
repairing the roof of the shabono. 
"I liked the dances and songs very much," 
I said. "I recognized your voice -it was 
beautiful." 
Ritimi beamed at me. "I sing very well." 
There was a charming candor and assurance 
in her statement; she was not boasting but only 
stating a fact. "I'm sure the hunters will return with plenty of game to feed the guests at the 
feast." 
Nodding in agreement, I looked for a twig, 
then began to sketch a human figure on the 
soft dirt. "This is the body of a white person," 
I said as I sketched the main organs and bones. 
"I wonder how the body of an lticoteri looks?" 
''You must be very tired to ask such a stupid 
question," Ritimi said, staring at me as if I 
were dim-witted. She stood up and began to 
dance, chanting in a loud melodious voice: 
"This is my head, this is my arm, this is my 
breast, this is my stomach, this is my ... " 
In no time at all, attracted by Ritirni's antics, 
a group of women and men gathered around 
us. Squealing and laughing, they made obscene 
remarks about each other's bodies. Some of the 
adolescent boys were laughing so hard, they 
rolled on the ground, holding their penises. 
"Can anyone draw a body the way I drew 
mine?" I asked. 
Several responded to this challenge. Grab­
bing a piece of wood, a twig, or a broken bow, 
they began to draw on the dirt. Their draw­
ings differed markedly from each other's, not 
only because of the obvious sexual differences, 
which they made sure to emphasize, but 
because all the men's bodies were depicted 
with tiny figures inside the chest. 
I could hardly hide my delight. I thought 
these must be the spirits I had heard Arasuwe 
summon with his chant before he began 
the curing session. "What are these?" I asked 
casually. 
"The hekuras of the forest who live in a 
man's chest," one of the men said. 
"Are all men shapori?" 
"All men have hekuras in their chests,'' the 
man said. "But onJy a real shapori can make 
use of them. Only a great shapori can 
command his hekuras to aid the sick and coun­
teract the spells of enemy shapori." Studying 
my sketch, he asked, "Why does your picture 
have hekuras, even in the legs? Women don't 
have hekuras ." 
I explained that these were not spirits, but 
organs and bones, and they promptly added 
them to their own drawings. Content with 
what I had learned, I willingly accompanjed 
Ritimi to gather firewood in the forest -the 
women's most arduous and unwelcome task. 

A TRUE ADVENTURE IN THE SOUTH AMERICAN JUNGLE 519 
They could never get enough wood, for the 
fires were never allowed to die. 
That evening, as she had done every night 
since I arrived at the settlement, Ritimi exam­
ined my feet for thorns and splinters. Satisfied 
that there were none, she rubbed them clean 
with her hands. 
"I wonder if the bodies of the shapori go 
through some kind of transformation when 
they are under the influence of epena," I said. 
It was important to have it confirmed in their 
own words, since the original premise of my 
theoretical scheme was that the shaman oper­
ated under certain assumptions concerning the 
body. I needed to know if these assumptions 
were shared by the group and if they were of 
a conscious or unconscious nature. 
"Did you see Iramamowe yesterday?" 
Ritimi asked. "Did you see him walk? Hjs feet 
didn't touch the ground. He is a powerful 
shapori. He became the great jaguar." 
"He didn't cure anyone," I said glumly. It 
disappointed me that Arasuwe' s brother was 
considered a great shaman. I had seen him beat 
his wife on two occasions. 
No longer interested in pursuing the con­
versation, Ritimi turned away from me and 
began to get ready for our evening ritual. 
Lifting the basket that held my belongings from the small loft at the back of the hut, she 
placed it on the ground. One by one she took 
out each item and held it above her head ' waiting for me to identify it. As soon as I did 
she repeated the name in Spanish, then in 
English, starting a nocturnal chorus as the 
headman' s wives and several other women 
who each night gathered in our hut echoed the 
foreign words. 
I relaxed in my hammock as Tutemi's fingers 
parted my hair searching for imaginary lice; I 
was certain I did not have any - not yet. 
Tutemi appeared to be five or six years 
younger than Ritimi, whom I believed ro be 
twenty. She was taller and heavier, her stomach 
round with her first pregnancy. She was shy 
and retiring. Often I had discovered a sad, 
faraway look in her dark eyes, and at times she 
talked to herself as if she were thinking aloud. 
"Lice! Lice!" Tutemi shouted, interrupting 
the women's Spanish-English chant. 
"Let me see;" I said; convinced that she was 
joking. "Are lice white?" I asked, examining 
the tiny white bugs on her finger. I had always 
believed they were dark. 
"White girl, white lice," Tutemi said mis­
chievous ly. With gleeful delight she crunched 
them one by one between her teeth and swal­
lowed them ... All lice are white.''
