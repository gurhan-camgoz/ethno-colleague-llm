[A man can tolerate his own blood starving to death, but he won't tolerate his blood 
attacked by a stranger] (local proverb) 
'A Hundred Thousand Welcomes' (Board Failte, Irish Tourist Board) 
'Well, I am sorry to tell you, Nancy, but you 
are not welcome. No you are not. Have they 
let you a place to stay down in the village?' I 
was standing awkwardly in the once familiar 
doorway of 'Martin's' sturdy country house in 
a ruggedly beautiful mountain hamlet of An 
Clochan, a bachelor's outpost of some nine or 
ten vestigial farm households. Once, we had 
been good neighbors. During the summer of 
1974, Martin had warded off the suspicions 
and dire warnings of his wary older sisters 
and had befriended us so far as to feel out my 
political sympathies toward various activities 
of the local IRA in which he and his extended 
family were involved. 'Ah, I should have 
listened to Aine', Martin said. 
Over the-past quarter of a century, some 
memories in An Clochan were engraved in 
stone like the family names of the Moriartys 
and the O'Neills carved over the smallest 
village shops in West Kerry signifying that this 
public house, this name, this family are forever. 
And what was remembered in this instance 
was a slight (in village terms, a slander) com­
mitted by me against the good name of the 
communi ty. Ever the proud nationalist, Martin warned me to stay clear of village institutions: 
'You'll not be expecting any mail while you are 
here', he said rather ominously. 
Martin still cut a dashing, if compact, figure, 
now sporting a pair of gold wire-rimmed 
designer eye glasses and dressed on that after­
noon in an impeccably starched white shirt. A 
shiny new sedan was parked outside his door. 
Martin's bachelor household, shared on the 
odd weekend with an older sister who works 
in the city, had clearly prospered over the past 
2 decades. But all traces of active engagement 
with the land are gone. There was no sign of 
the haying that should have been going on 
during those precious few warm and sunny 
days in mid-June. No symmetrical mound of 
soft, boggy turf stood in front of the farm 
house. A quick side-long glance to the right 
showed the barn standing empty and swept 
clean. Above all, the neat row of newly laun­
dered clothing strung across the outdoor line 
included no work-a-day overalls or denim 
shirts. What was once an active and viable farm 
had become a gentlemanly country home, a far 
cry from the days of Martin's youth when his 
beloved 'Da', the patriarch of large household,

rose early on winter mornings and went down 
to the sea to gather crannach, dilisk, carageen 
and other native edible seaweeds, half-freezing 
in his shirt-tails and warming himself by 
beating his sturdy arms across his chest. This, 
mind you, accomplished before the real work 
day of the farm had begun. 
When Martin was still a very young man an 
older and more robust brother was sent off to 
America to make room for Marrin, one of the 
younger and more vulnerable sons, to take up 
the family farm. Although primogeniture was 
then still customar y, the father-p atriarch had 
the freedom to choose his primary heir among 
his sons, according to his perceptions of his 
sons' skills, personalities, aptitudes and needs, 
as well as his and his wife's needs as they grew 
older. And the Da had settled upon Martin. 
But during the man's life-time, farming ceased 
being.an enviable way of life and sibling jeal­
ousy had turned to sympathy toward those 
who were left behind to till the small 'rock 
farms' of An Clochan. And Martin's diasporic 
siblings had fared exceedingly well, numbering 
among them college teachers and clergy.1 
Aine, the older sister, scowling while drying 
a plate and peering over Martin's shoulder, 
came out of the back of the house to give me 
a scolding: �who made you such an authority? 
You weren't such a grand person when you 
and your family came to live in our bungalow. 
You could hardly control your own children. 
Why don't you go home and write about your 
own troubles. God knows, you've got plenty 
of them, with school children shooting each 
other and US planes bombing hospitals in 
Kosovo. Why pick on us?' 
Martin interjected: 'Admit it. You wrote a 
book to please yourself at our expense. You ran 
us down, girl, you ran us down. You call what 
you do a science?' And before I could deny that 
I did, he continued, 'A science, to be sure, the 
science of scandals. We warn our village 
children before they go off to the university in 
Cork or Dublin to beware books about Ireland 
written by strangers.' Seeing that his words had 
found their mark and tears were coursing freely 
down my cheeks, Martin softened his stance a 
bit, but not his sister who roundly rejected my 
apologies: 'You say you are sorry, but we don't 
believe it. Those are crocodile tears! You are 
just crying for yourself.' Breaking the mood, Martin turned to my 
adult son, Nate, who was busy trying to 
hide himself in a thick hedge near the barn. 
Martin's words were soft and courtly: 'You are 
a fine looking lad to be sure, Nate, and I'm 
sorry to be talking to your mother like this in 
your presence.' Then, he returned his gaze to 
me: 'Sure, nobody's perfect, nobody's a saint. 
We all have our weaknesses. But you never 
wrote about our strengths. You never said 
what a beautiful and a safe place our village 
is. You never wrote about the vast sweep of 
the eye that the village offers over the sea and 
up to Conor Pass. You said nothing about our 
fine musicians and poets, and our step dancers 
who move through the air with the grace of a 
silk thread. And we are not such a backwater 
today. There are many educated people among 
us. You wrote about our troubles, all right, 
but not about our strengths . What about the 
friendliness of neighbors? What about our love 
for Mother Ireland and our proud work of 
defending it?' When I protested that I could 
not have written about those radical activities 
for fear of reprisals from outside against the 
village, Martin replied: 'Ah, you were only 
protecting yourself.' 'Is there anything I can 
do?' I asked. 'You should have thought about 
that before. Look, girl, the fact is that ya just 
didn't give us credit.' 
Homecoming 
Twenty-five years had elapsed since a young 
and somewhat brash anthropologist and her 
off-beat, counter -cultural family -shaggy­
haired, gentle 'hippie' husband and their three 
rambunctious babies and toddlers -stumbled 
somewhat dazed and almost by default into 
the relatively isolated, rugged mountain com­
munity of 'Ballybran' just over the spectacu­
larly beautiful Conor Pass through the Slieve 
Mish mountains past the Maharees and 
nestled on the shores of Brandon Bay, a cui de 
sac on the eastern end of the Dingle Peninsula 
in West Kerry. 
It was late spring 1974 and we had reached 
the end of the line, figuratively and literally. 
We had spent several weeks in a rented car 
canvassing villages in West Kerry and West 
Cork in search of an Irish-speaking (though 

204 NANCY SCHEPER -HUGHES 
bilingual) community kind enough to accept 
our presence for a year of live-in fieldwork. We 
would begin our tentative inquiries about 
securing housing with the local post mistress 
or the resident curate or parish priest only to 
be told that people living in this or that com­
munity would not much fancy being observed 
by a live-in stranger. Ethnographic fieldwork 
was still a new and alien concept for a country 
people known both for their spectacular 
hospitality and for their fierce family loyalty 
and privacy . Tourists who came and went for 
the brief salmon-fishing season on the Dingle 
Peninsula were one thing, and bothersome 
enough in their own way, but a resident writer­
anthropologist was something else again. In 
a country dedicated both to the banning of 
books and to revering the written word, any 
writer learns to tread lightly and to have a 
quick exit plan. 
On arriving for the first time in 'Ballybran' 
I introduced myself and my family to the 
young curate of the spectacularly beautiful 
'half-parish' with some trepidation. My official 
documents failed to dazzle this down-to-earth 
curate. What did make a difference were letters 
from our local university chaplain vouching 
that Michael and I were 'good enough' 
Catholics, if perhaps a bit wayward in our 
post-Vatican II enthusiasms for the transfor­
mation of Mother Church, and an almost illeg­
ible note from an older friend and informal 
mentor, the late Canon Law scholar, David 
Daube, stating that we were trustworthy and 
decent people. And so, ironically , with the 
sponsorship and blessing of the same Irish 
Catholic Church that I would take to task in 
the pages of my book, we settled into Bally­
bran a few weeks before the feast of Corpus 
Christi in June 1974 and we stayed until late 
spring the following year. 
A Fine Touch of 
Irish Madness 
I arrived in Ballybran with a starting set of 
altogether alien and 'outsider' questions. Why 
did the Irish claim the highest rates of hospi­
talized mental illness in the world? Why was 
schizophrenia the primary diagnosis used in mental hospitals there? I believed that by 
studying 'madness' l could learn something 
about the nature of Irish society and culture as 
a whole. Deeply influenced by the early writ­
ings of Michel Foucault, I believed that a 
society revealed itself most in the phenomena 
it excludes, rejects and confines. Irish madness, 
I hypothesized, could be seen as a projection 
of specifically Irish conflicts and themes. 
What was going on in remote, supposedly 
bucolic, western Ireland that was over­
producing so many young psychiatric cases? 
Who were the likely candidates for mental 
hospital? What were the events that led up to a 
psychiatric crisis? Did the Irish actually have 
more mental illness than elsewhere, or were 
they simply more likely to label a village non­
conformist as mad? Was the straight and 
narrow of Irish country life so rigid that it led 
to a straitjacket for some? What was going on 
in Irish farm families, and in the public spaces 
of village life, schools, pubs and church? 
The book that emerged, Saints, Scholars 
and Schizophrenics : Mental Illness in Rural 
Ireland (1979), was a blend of old and new 
approaches: child rearing and adult personal­
ity, TAT tests, and reflexive/interpretive 
anthropology. Theoretically eclectic, it applied 
insights from Freud, Erikson, Durkheim, 
Gregory Bateson, R. D. Laing, and Michel 
Foucault to a tiny population of Irish­
speaking farmers, shepherds and� ·fishermen. 
Using the heterodox field methods of a quali­
tative and interpretive ethnograp her, I amassed 
a great deal of circumstanti al evidence sup­
porting the pathogenicity of certain aspects of 
rural Irish social relations, especially those 
between the sexes and between parents and 
children. Rural Ireland, I concluded, was a 
place where it was difficult to be 'sane' and 
where �normal' villagers could appear more 
'deviant' than those institutionalized in the 
County Kerry mental hospital. 
Madness was, I argued, a social script and 
there were appropriate and inappropriate ways 
of 'going' and 'being' mad in rural Ireland. 
Extreme eccentricity was allowable, even 
coddled, if it could pass as harmless 'foolery' 
or if it came wrapped in the mantle of Irish 
spiritualit y. 'Mihal, bless him, hasn't been quite 
right since the death of his mother, but what 

IRE IN IRELAND 205 
harm if he sits up all night in the barn singing 
to the cows?' Mihal would never see the walls 
of St Finian's madhouse. But there would be 
no excuses made for Seamus, the reluctant 44-
year-old bachelor who expressed his frustra­
tion at a parish dance by leaping to the stage 
and drunkenly exposing himself to a crowd of 
village girls. He, of course, was quite mad. 
Central to my thesis was the image of a 
dying and anomie rural Ireland resulting from 
the cumulative effects of British colonization, 
the Great Famine (1845-9}, and various 
20th-century development and 'moderniza­
tion' schemes that tied the economy of rural 
western Ireland to Great Britain and then, with 
Ireland's belated entry into the European 
Community in 1973, to western Europe, as a 
whole. Throughout the process, the final ves­
tiges of a subsistence-based peasant economy 
were destroyed to make way for capitalist 
modes and relations of production. The symp­
toms of malaise that I was observing in the 
mid-1970s were many: population decline in 
the coastal western vill�ges resulting from 
' out-migration and permanent celibacy; wide­
spread welfare dependency of young, displaced 
farmers, shepherds and fishermen; depression, 
alcoholism and episodes of madness pushing 
up the Irish psychiatric hospitalization rates 
into first place worldwide. 
Beneath the quaint thatched roofs and 
between the thick, clay walls of the rural farm 
households what was going on was an extra­
ordinary emotional drama of labeling and 
denial that allowed some Irish county children 
(especially daughters and first-born sons) to 
achieve fulJ adult status, education and even­
tual emancipation from the family, while con­
signing other children (especially latter-born 
sons) to the status of the 'leftover', worthless 
and pathetic 'aindeiseoir' of the family. Every 
rural family seemed to have its high-achieving 
first-born pet sons and its under-achieving, 
last-born backward and painfully shy bache­
lors and its hopeless and stigmatized black 
sheep. Parental aspirations for achievement 
and status rested with the first-born, and 
everything was sacrificed to improve his life 
chances. In the 'old days' when farming was 
still a valued and productive way of life, he 
would have inherited the farm. But with Ireland's entry into the European Economic 
Communi ty, the prized first-born was being 
reared for export, for emigration. 
The rural Irish parents were faced with a 
new problem: how to keep back at least one 
son for the farm and to care for them in their 
old age. The task involves a certain amount of 
psychological violence: a cutting down to size 
and a crippling of the aspirations of the desig­
nated farm heir. In collaboration with village 
teachers, shopkeepers and the parish priest, 
farm parents tended to create a 'sacrificial 
child', oddly enough not in the form of the dis­
inherited and dispossessed child, but in the 
more lethal and ambiguous form of the farm 
heir. From the time of his birth the heir is 
labeled 'the left over', 'the last of the litter', 
'the scraping of the pot', 'the runt', 'the old 
cow's calf', a child who could never survive 
beyond the tolerant and familial confines of 
the village. 'Blessed are the meek', it is written, 
'for they shall inherit the earth' ... and with it 
(I wanted to add} a life of involuntary celibacy, 
poverty, obedience and self-negating service to 
the old ones. 
Through shaming and ridicule the farm heir 
eventually grows to fit his reduced role and life 
chances, and he comes to think of himself as 
only good enough for the farm and for the 
village, places generally thought of as not very 
good at all. Often enough the boy is able to 
make the necessary accommodations to his 
role. I have always been struck, even early in 
my anthropological career, by the enormous 
resilience and elasticity of the human spirit 
despite the violence that culture and society so 
often visit upon it. And there were, at le.ast in 
the case of rural Ireland, some compensations 
and rewards: the boy who stays behind is 
praised as the dutiful, loyal, 'saint' of a son. 
Some farm heirs never adjusted to the 
demands made of them and they aged poorly, 
becoming angry, isolated, bitter individuals, 
cut off from the flow of human life. Some 
became the depressed and alcoholic bachelor 
farmers who populated the several pubs that 
cater to a population of just 400 and some 
villagers. Others became eccentric hermits, and 
still others who deviated too far from the 
straight and narrow of village life became 
psychiatric patients at St Finian's Mental 

206 NANCY SCHEPER- HUGHES 
Hospital in Killarney. Many of these men were 
preoccupied with paranoid fears of bodily 
encroachment or obsessed with unfulfiJled 
sexual and generative needs and fantasies. 
Why didn't they escape? Some would have 
if they could, but too often they conceded to 
the prevailing view of themselves as incom­
plete men, lacking something, a bit too soft. 
To his face I've heard it said of a dedicated 
stay-at-home son: 'Sure our Paddy is a big old 
slob of a man, soft and sentimental, full of 
dutcas' (i.e. referring to warm, almost mater­
nal, fellow feeling) while the man in question 
would nod his head in agreement. Hence, the 
rural Irish 'double bind' -two contradictory 
injunctions - on the one hand: 'You're worth­
less, you can't live beyond the farm; sure, if 
you had any guts you would have been out of 
here years ago', and, on the other: 'We need 
you-you're all we have; how could you even 
think of leaving your poor old Da? You're 
the last hope we have!' A third injunction 
prevented any escape from the horns of the 
dilemma: Stay, but you are forever a boy-o; 
leave, but you are guilty of filial disloyalty. A 
powerful ideology in the form of a puritanical 
and authoritarian version of Catholicism 
bolstered the symbolic violence contained in 
the exploitative social and family systems. 
I had reinterpreted Gregory Bateson's 
(Bateson et al., 1963) double-bind hypothesis 
of schizophrenia within a larger social context 
to show that not only individual families, but 
entire communities can participate in patterns 
of distorted communication that can harm the 
individual while rescuing the social system. 
Scapegoating, collusions, family myths, and 
'bad faith relations' are found not only in dis­
eased or 'weak' families but in vulnerable 
communities as well. Social and economic sit­
uations can be double-binding, so that hard 
pressed farm families are forced to engage in 
unfair tactics for self-preservation at the 
expense of the designated child, and the whole 
community can come to accept and reinforce 
such distorted 'family myths'. It was not my 
intention to 'blame' village parents, but rather 
to shed light on an aspect of the rural Irish col­
lective unconscious so that, once recognized, 
the emancipation and liberation of the gener­
ative scapego at-the 'good, stay-at-home' son 
-might be possible. The 'Native' Reaction: 
Ethnography on the Couch 
Ironically, no sooner was I notified in early 
1980 that I was to receive the Margaret Mead 
Award from the Society for Applied Anthro­
pology, honoring a book that 'communic ated 
anthropological ideas and concepts to a 
broadly concerned public', than Saints, Schol­
ars and Schizophrenics became embroiled in a 
large and lively trans-Atlantic controve rsy. The 
first critics of the book suggested that 'Bally­
bran' did not exist at all, and that it represents 
a 'composite', made up of bits and pieces of 
dozens of rural communities, both real and 
imagined. But in the fall of 1980 a columnist 
from the Irish Times, Michael Viney, headed 
out along the Dingle Peninsula, peddling his 10-
speed mountain bicycle, buffeted by awesome 
gale winds and pelting sheets of rain in search 
of what he later described in one of his columns 
as the 'mythical valley of Bally bran'. 
After a few false starts and cases of mistaken 
identity, Viney (1980) rejoiced on finally reach­
ing his desired goal as he slipped inside the 
snug materiality of Peg's Pub. 'Yes', said 
the publican identifying herself, 'I was one [in 
the book] who didn't believe in sociological 
statistics !' 'Mrs Scheper-Hughes had sat here 
often', Viney mused with a pint of Guinness in 
his hand, 'as I was doing now ,, with the rain 
hosing down from the mountains beyond the 
open door.' In a subsequent column (1983), 
Viney pictured himself as he thought the 
anthropologist might have seen him: 
Sometimes - cycling over the hill to the post 
office, past the rusty, crumpled bracken and 
the lichen-crusted walls -I look down at the 
little houses (which are for my writerly pur­
poses cro uched in Atlantic mist) and wonder 
what the anthropologist would make of our 
community (or indeed, of me, a squinting, 
unkempt figure in black oilskins and dripping 
cap, alienated, irretrievably from his own 
urban peer group, the epitome of anomie on 
wheels). Would she decide that our remote 
half-parish . . . have a whole new perspective 
on [its] right or ability to exist?' 
Both the scholarly and the popular Irish and 
Irish-American communities were up in arms. 

IRE IN IRELAND 207 
The approach I was developing - a form of 
cultural critique -was seen as 'biased' and 
ethnocentric. Admittedly, my approach devi­
ated from the usual anthropological manners 
which determined that we describe only what 
was 'good' and 'right' about a given society 
and culture. One was not to use anthropology 
in order to diagnose the ailing parts of the 
social body as a cultural pathologist of sons. 
Why, I was asked, did my description of 
unhappy and conflict-ridden rural life depart 
so radically from Conrad Arensberg's (1937) 
classic and almost loving portrajt of The Irish 
Countrym an? In part, perhaps, because my 
ethnography was told, not from the perspec­
tive of the old men seated comfo rtably at the 
pub and at the hub of Irish country life, but 
from the perspective of their thwarted middle­
aged sons. These were the 'young lads' and 
boy-os who would have to wait until their 50s, 
if lucky, to come of age and into their own, 
and even then they would have to wait, hand 
and foot, on the old ones who had retired to 
the 'west room' of the household and who, 
unlike their fathers before�them, would most 
likely never marry, given the demographic 
imbalance [village girls had long since begun 
to desert the village lured by the promise of rel­
ative freedom that out-migration represented] 
or have a family and therefore a power base 
of their own. 
Saints, Scholars and Schizophrenics offered 
a counter-hegemonic view of Irish country life, 
bur one that struck some sensibilities as 'anti­
Irish', 'anti-Catholic', or 'anti-clerical'.2 In her 
incisive review of my book for the progres­
sive Catholic journal, Commonweal, Sidney 
Callahan (1979: 311) charged me with reli­
gious bias suggesting that I was 'strangely 
insensitive to the religious idealism of the 
people' and that 'my hostility to the sexual 
repressiveness of Irish Jansenism, a hostility 
always to be encouraged [presumably by 
secular humanists such as myself], had made 
(me] tone deaf in [my] interpretation of reli­
gious phenomena.' Where I had seen needless 
self-sacrifice, Callahan questioned whether 
some 'repressions weren't worth the price' and 
she suggested that 'wit, learning, music, the 
work ethic, and altruistic sacrifice for family 
and high ideals' might also flourish in Ireland 
exactly because sex, aggression, and individu-alism were so severely curtailed. If the rural 
Irish values of self-discipline and mortification 
of the flesh contribute to the isolation, 
celibacy, depression, madness and alcoholism 
of bachelor farmers, they might also account 
for the extremely low incidence in the Repub­
lic of Ireland of physical assault, rape, adultery 
and divorce. 
Another Irish-American critic, Eileen Kane 
(1982), described Saints as 'unethical' in its 
violation of the 'privacy' of the community 
and its right to maintain its 'community 
secrets'. These refer to the 'best-kept and worst 
kept secrets' (Bourdieu, 1977: 173), the ones 
that everyone in the community must keep in 
order to ensure the complicity of all in the col­
lective forms of bad faith that make social life 
possible, such as, in this instance, the symbolic 
violence against the farm heir masquerading as 
concern and generosity toward the poor, inept 
last born sons of the village. In my various 
responses I denied that anthropologists had 
a responsibility to honor community secrets, 
especially those protecting what Sartre (1956) 
meant by 'bad faith' relations. 
In From Anxiety to Method, George 
Devereux (1977) observed that in the field, as 
on the couch, the dynamics of transference and 
counter-transference can shape the ethnogra­
pher's perceptions and the resulting analysis. 
Indeed, the field can loom as a large Rorschach 
test for the naive anthropologist. Lacking 
sufficient critical distance and reflexive insight, 
the result can be distortion in the form of 
glaring omissions, editing, ambiguous descrip­
tions and so forth. Ethnographers may use the 
field to work out their own neurotic conflicts 
and anxieties about attachment, power, 
authority, sanity, gender or sexuality. Here, 
confrontation and projection, rather than 
avoidance and denial, can lead to distortion in 
the form of a highly subjective interpretation 
that does violence to the natives' own under­
standing of the meaning of their culture and 
social relations. 
From time to time, Devereux cautioned, 
the ethnographer should pause to analyse the 
nature of the object relations in the field and 
at home throughout the process of data analy­
sis and writing. The goal of such ethnological 
self-analysis was to expose and to strip away 
the layers of subjectivity and bias that get 

208 NANCY SCHEPER-HUGHES 
in the way and distort the perception of an 
objective ethnographic reality. To the end 
Devereux remained an empiricist dedicated to 
a belief in the perfectibility of objective anthro­
pological facts, data and interpret ation. 
In the aftermath of the Irish controversy, I 
found Devereux's solution less than satisfying. 
For, as I saw it, the real dilemma and con­
tradiction was this: How can we know what 
we know other than by filtering experience 
through the highly subjective categories of 
thinking and feeling that represent our own 
particular ways of being - such as the Ameri­
can Catholic-school-tra ined, rebellious though 
still ambivalently Catholic, post-Freu dian, 
neo-Marxist, feminist woman I was in my 
initial encounter with the villagers of 
Bally bran. 
Both the danger and the value of anthro� 
pology lie in the clash and collision of cultures 
and interpretations as the anthropologist 
meets her subjects in a spirit of open engage-· 
ment, frankness and receptivity. There was, 
I concluded, no 'politically correct' way of 
doing anthropology. Anthropology is by 
nature intrusive and it entails a certain amount 
of symbolic and interpretive violence to the 
'native' peoples' own intuitive, though stil1 
partial, underst anding of their part of the 
world. The question then becomes an ethical 
one: What are the proper relations between the 
anthropologist and her subjects? To whom 
does she owe her loyalties, and how can these 
be met in the course of ethnographic fieldwork 
and writing, especially within the problematic 
domain of psychologica l and psychiatric 
anthropology where the focus on disease and 
distress, difference and marginality, over­
determine a critical view. 
Getting Over: Crediting 
An Clochan 
Over the past two decades, 'Ballybran' has 
been host to a small but steady stream of 
anthropologists and sociologists from Europe 
and North America -little red paperback of 
Saints, Scholars and Schizophrenics in hand -
searching among the dispersed mountain 
hamlets for some of the key protagonists of the book. And so, the drama of hide-and-seek 
played between villagers and their various 
defenders, unabashed curiosity seekers and 
global interlocutors continues to this day. 
Today, of course, neither 'Ballybran', 
anthropol ogy, nor the ethnographer are what 
they were in the mid-1970s. The Ballybran 
that I describe here is barely recognizable. The 
last of the real thatched farm houses have been 
razed and modern suburban ranch style homes 
have appeared in their place. The only 
'thatched cottage' in evidence is NeUie Brick's 
former tea-rashers-butter-and-bread shop now 
being renovated as a snug and romantic pub 
for the pleasure of tourists. The interior is 
rustic English countryside and the thatch has 
been imported from Poland. But the thatchers, 
at least, are from Killarney even if they learned 
their 'traditional' trade courtesy of a develop­
ment grant from the European Union. Still, the 
thatch smells as sweet and inviting as ever, and 
some kind soul had thought to stick a card­
board sign on a window sill indicating 'Nellie's 
window', the vantage point from which the 
wonderful old wag had once kept tabs on 
the village world. 
Still, were I to be writing the book for the 
first time and with hindsight, of course there 
are things I would do differently. I would be 
inclined to avoid the 'cute' and 'conventional' 
use of pseudonyms. Nor would I attempt to 
scramble certain identifying features of the 
individuals portrayed on the naive assumption 
that these masks and disguises could not be 
rather easily de-coded by villagers themselves. 
I have come to see that the time-honored prac­
tice of bestowing anonymity on 'our' commu­
nities and informants fools few and protects no 
one-save, perhaps, the anthropologist's own 
skin. And I fear that the practice makes rogues 
of us all -too free with our pens, with the 
government of our tongues, and with our loose 
translations and interpretations of village life. 
Anonymity makes us unmindful that we 
owe our anthropological subjects the same 
degree of courtesy, empathy and friendship in 
writing as we generally extend to them face to 
face in the field where they are not our 'sub­
jects' but our boon companions without whom 
we quite literally could not survive. Sacrificing 
anonymity means we may have to write less 

IRE IN IRELAND 209 
poignant, more circumspect ethnographies, a 
high price for any writer to pay. But our 
version of the Hippocratic oath - to do no 
harm, in so far as possible, to our informants 
-would seem to demand this. Additionally , a 
hermeneutics of (self-) doubt could temper our 
brutally frank sketches of other people's lives 
as we see them, close-up but always from 
the outside looking in and 'through a glass 
darkly'. 
As for the selectivity of my observations, 
what I had left out and what I might have said 
about An Clochan in the mid-1970s was that 
the village offered an extraordinary glimpse of 
a closed corporate rural community in which 
social hierarchy and social difference were suc­
cessfully curtailed, where 'putting on airs' was 
spumed in the interests of communi tas and 
where, despite the general rule of farm family 
patriarchy, girls were reared to be high achiev­
ers, women did not have to marry, and single 
women could raise sheep, drive cows, manage 
a .village pub, run a primary or secondary 
school, scold the local gom.been man, or boss 
· the local curate till he 'cried uncle' and gave in 
on a particular theological or political point. 
Rural women could choose to marry young or 
they could wait and marry late in life and then 
marry men much younger than themselves. 
Alternatively, especially in a family of daugh­
ters, they could refuse several marriage pro­
posals in order to remain at home and inherit 
their father's fields and his favorite pipe or 
their father's pub and his celebrated goat-skin 
drum, Moreover , married women kept their 
maiden names and their pre-marital social and 
self identities. 
Perhaps nowhere else in the world were 
women so free to walk country roads at night 
without fear of either physical assault or mali­
cious gossip. Nowhere else have I seen women 
and men banter with each other in public 
without every source of humor reduced to a 
double-entendre. And nowhere else were bach­
elors and spinsters accepted as normal and 
unremarkable members of society, able to lead 
autonomous, if lonely, lives. No eyebrows 
were raised at the bachelor who not only 
planted and harvested but also cooked his own 
spuds, who not only raised his own sheep but 
was quite capable of knitting his own socks and sweateL How distant this was from Ivan 
Illich's ( 1982: 67) description of the woeful 
state of bachelors in those parts of traditional 
Europe more characterized by gender 
'complementarity': 
You could recognize the bachelor from afar by 
his stench and gloomy looks .... Solitary men 
leh no sheets or shirts when they died .... A 
man without a wife, sister, mother, or daugh­
ter had no way to make, wash, and mend his 
clothes; it was impossible for him to keep 
chickens or to milk a goat. 
In An Clochan at the time of my study social 
life was not confined to couples. Dress for both 
sexes was casual and the sturdy figure ahead 
of you on the road wrapped in layers of 
trousers, woolen vests, long coat and shod in 
muddy green Wellington boots, and waving a 
stick, was just as likely to be that of a woman 
'driving' her small herd of cows. I may have 
misread important aspects of social life in a 
community where gender and sibling bonding 
was as or more important than the sexual 
or the erotic bond. If marital relations were 
problematic it was in part because marriage 
interrupted and intruded upon other compet­
ing and equally valued affections and loyalties. 
Surely any anthropologist practicing today 
would not wish to suggest a hierarchy of 
appropriate affections such that life-long 
friendships, brotherly and sisterly in nature, 
would somehow count for less than conjugal 
relations. 
If psychiatric hospitalization rates were 
high, rape and sexual assault were unknown 
at that same time. Theft was so rare that one 
definition of an eccentric was a person who 
was overly preoccupied about the safety of his 
property, while a case of 'paranoid schizo­
phrenia' could be diagnosed on the grounds of 
having accused one's neighbors of wanting to 
steal one's sheep or cows or having shifted the 
stone boundaries that mark off one field from 
another. And 'Brendan the rapist' who I inter­
viewed at the county mental hospital in 
Killarney had sinned only in his thoughts and 
was by his own account a virgin, unlucky in 
sex. So, as a young married woman in An 
Clochan, I could hail a ride on the back of 
Morris's motorbike without any hint of 

210 NANCY SCHEPER-HUGHES 
scandal, just as I could sit and talk with the 
local curate over a mid-morning cup of tea in 
his living room with the priest still in his 
paJamas. 
House-keeping, gardening and meal­
preparation were kept to a minimum, thus 
freeing both women and men for other volun­
tary activities and a good deal of leisure time 
that was spent in fostering friendship and con­
viviality ....: for men in one of several village pubs, 
at local sheep fares and regiona l markets, and 
for women in shops, church and school related 
activities, and for older women and widows in 
house caUs to friends and far-out kin. There was 
time out for story-telling and time out for play. 
There was time to gather around deaths, wakes 
and funerals -a ftill day was given over for the 
funerals of each of the 38 villagers who died 
during 1974-5. Everyone had radios and some 
owned televisions, but most people still pre­
ferred 'live entertainment' and they gathered. 
frequently, especially during the winter, at pubs, 
church halls and in each others' homes to enter­
tain themselves with their own music, singing, 
step-dancing, and poetry recitation. Both 
young and old, male and female, were encour­
aged to develop their own repertoire of songs, 
recitations, or 'steps' which they could be called 
on to perform at the drop of a hat. Though the 
shyness and modesty of bachelors could be 
heart-breaking, the institutionalized pattern of 
'coaxing' could bring even the most reluctant 
fisherman or shepherd to perform his 'party 
piece' and shine before his peers. 
The ethic of modesty and deference assured 
that no one singer ever stood out or sought 
undue attention. Meanwhile, the reciprocal 
call and response mode -'Sing us a song, 
Paddy'; 'Oh, I couldn't', etc. -allowed for the 
limited expression of praise and appreciation 
which could always destabilize into 'codding' 
-'Sure, he's the best singer in the village'. 
Together these promoted a strong sense of 
community solidarity at the expense of the 
individual, aimed as they were at suppressing 
any hint of unseemly arrogance or self­
importance. In other words, social equality 
was fostered through the very same witty 
games of 'codding', 'giving the mickey' and 
'having a crack' which I had described in 
Saints and Scholars as having a decidedly 
adverse effect on the more psychologi cally vulnerable individuals who were less able to 
evaluate and respond appropriately to the 
'double-binding' messages they carried. To 
wit: refuse the praise and you are putting a 
damper on the high spirits of your compan­
ions; accept the praise and you appear the fool 
for taking it seriously. 
Gregory Bateson, who had developed the 
'double bind' theory of schizophrenia that I 
used in my book, understood that human com­
munication patterns were extremely complex 
and that some double-binding injunctions 
were damaging to certain individuals while 
some were beneficial, even therapeutic to 
others. The verbal duels and interactional chal­
lenges so characteristic of rural Irish wit may 
have contributed to the cognitive dissonance 
suffered by Irish schizophrenics unable to dif­
ferentiate literal from metaphorical truth. But 
-just as surely these communication patterns 
contributed to the development of Ireland's 
long tradition of saints, poets and scholars as 
well. 
So, while I told the anecdote about the cruel 
codding in the pub of a shy bachelor who was 
teased unmercifully about his inability to 
speak to me without stammering, I failed to 
tell the anecdote about the day of our leave­
taking from the village when I saw out my 
front window the very same painfully shy man 
standing under a tree at the bottom of the little 
path that led up to our cottage . I wondered 
what he was doing there, 'loitering' for such a 
long time. I went about my packing and house­
cleaning, but each time I passed the window I 
saw him standing there, so still, hardly chang­
ing his posture. Finally, after a few hours, it 
occurred to me that perhaps he was waiting 
for me to come down the path on my way to 
the village after an errand. So, I packed up the 
babies into strollers and backpacks and we 
made our way down the path as if on our way 
to the village post office. As I came close to 
Paddy, I shyly lifted a finger and crooked my 
neck at him in the traditional, understated 
Kerryman greeting at which Paddy came 
forward and put out his hand which I clasped 
in both of mine as he said: 'You're leaving us. 
I just wished ... wanted ... well ... God bless 
you, Mum. And God bless Michael and the 
wee ones, too.' In all my many comings and 
goings as an anthropologist, there was no 

IRE IN IRELAND 211 
goodbye that I have held as dear over the many 
years as this one which had been wrested from 
the giver with so much difficulty. 
The supreme irony is that the anthropolo­
gist who has always been in search of a rela­
tively classless, genderless, egalitarian society, 
had stumbled on to one early in her career 
without ever recognizing it as such or singing 
its praises in this regard. This village egalitar­
ianism was expressed as well in the painful 
decisions that had to be made about inheri­
tance, the argument that was so central to my 
thesis. While these decisions never came easily 
to either generation, parents or children, in the 
end they were decided with a strong commit­
ment to fairness and with attention to correct­
ing the unwitting losses experienced by one 
sibling at the hands of the other. Unlike rural 
English patterns of primogeniture based on a 
'winner takes all' model, Irish farm families 
always strived to settle each of their 'disinher­
ited' sons and daughters with some kind of life 
security - whether through carefully sought 
after connections with po�ential patrons in 
commerce and the trades in the next town (see 
Arensberg, 1937) or through the Catholic 
Church and its extensive web of educational 
and social welfare institutions, or through 
helpful relatives and former neighbors abroad 
-so that virtually no 'disinherited' Irish child 
was sent out into the world to 'seek their 
fortune' alone as had so many generations of 
'disinherited' rural English children (see Bird­
well-Pheasant, 1998). Consequently , the 
'traveling' and diasporic Irish, including over 
the generations a great many from the little 
parish of An Clochan, have contributed, dis­
proportionately , to the culture and civilization 
of the larger English-speaking world (see 
Hout, 1989: chapter 5; Keneally, 1998). For all 
these reasons and for whatever it could possi­
bly matter now -all credit to An Clochan. 
Crediting Ethnography 
To begin with, I wanted that truth to life to 
possess a concrete reliability, and I rejoiced 
most when the poem seemed most direct, an 
up front representation of the world it stood 
in for or stood up for or stood its ground 
against. (Heaney, 1995:12) At the heart of the anthropological method 
is the practice of witnessing, which requires 
an engaged immersion over time in the lived 
worlds of our anthropological subjects. Like 
poetry, ethnography is an act of translation 
and the kind of 'truth' that it produces is 
necessarily deeply subjective, resulting from 
the collision between two worlds and two 
cultures. And so, the question often posed 
to anthropologist-ethnographers about the 
dangers of 'losing one's objectivity' in the field 
is really quite beside the point. Our task 
requires of us only a highly disciplined subjec­
tivity. There are scientific methods and models 
appropriate to other ways of doing anthropo­
logical research, but ethnography , as I under­
stand it, is not a science. 
Very much like the poet who decides to enter 
another oeuvre for the purpose of translation 
-Seamus Heaney, for example, describing his 
entering the poetry of Dante3 -the anthropol­
ogist sees something in another world that 
intrigues them. It can be as simple as 'Oh, I 
like that! Let me see if I can't understand how 
that particular mode of being and thinking and 
feeling and sensing the world works, the sense 
it makes, the logic and the illogic of it, the 
pragmatics and the poetics of that other way 
of life.' And so we think, 'Yes, I'll go there for 
a while and see if I can't come back with a nar­
rative, a natural history, a thick description -
call it what you will-that will enrich our ways 
of understanding the world'. Like any other 
form of 'translation' ethnography has a preda­
tory and writerly motive to it. It is not done 
'for nothing' in a totally disinterested way. It 
is for something, often it is to help us under­
stand something -whether it is about schizo­
phrenia as a projection of cultural themes or 
about ways of solving perennial human dilem­
mas around the reproduction of bodies and 
families and homes and farms. 
In referring to his own long-term project 
of translating the Beowulf, Seamus Heaney 
(1999} drew on a generative metaphor based 
on the Viking relationship between England 
and Ireland, distinguishing between the histor­
ical period known as the Viking raids and the 
period known as the settlement. The raid, he 
said, is a very good motive for poetic transla­
tion. The poet can raid Italian or German 
poetry and come back with a kind of 'booty' 

212 NANCY SCHEPER-HUGHES 
called 'imitations' of Homer or Virgil, for 
example. Or, alternatively -as Heaney did 
with the Beowulf translation -the poet can 
approach the translation through 'settlement', 
that is, entering the oeuvre, 'colonizing' it, 
taking it over for one's artistic purposes. In set­
tling in with the work, you stay with it a long 
time, identify with it in an imaginative way. 
You change it and it changes you. 
Similarly, there are 'raiding' and 'settlement' 
ways of doing the work of anthropological 
translation, although granted both these 
metaphors play on our discipline's worst night­
mares. Neither raiders nor settlers have much 
currency in the parts of the post-colonial world 
where most of us still work. In our vocabulary, 
'raiding' is what-Margaret Mead sometimes 
did -going in and after a culture in order to 
raid an idea, a practice that could be useful 
to young mothers in Boston or to adolescents 
in Los Angeles. Another form of raiding is_ 
the kind of 'quick and dirty' research we 
sometimes conduct with a specific goal, such 
as evaluating an AIDS prevention program in 
Botswana or a child survival program in 
Northeast Brazil for a governmental or inter­
national agency. Quick and dirty - a raid, if 
you will -but necessary at times and valuable 
in its own right. 
And, then, there is ethnography and partic­
ipant observation -the settlement metaphor 
par excellence. Here we enter, settle down, and 
try to stay for as long as people will tolerate 
our presence. As 'travelling people' we are at 
the mercy of those who agree to take us in as_ 
much as they are at our mercy in the ways we 
represent them after the living-in and living­
with is over. Anthropologists are a restless and 
nomadic tribe, hunters and gatherers of human 
values. Often we are motivated by our own 
sense of estrangement from the society and 
culture into which we were existentially 
thrown. I went to rural Ireland, in no small 
part, in search of better ways to live and I 
found these especially among some of the old 
ones with whom I spent the greater part of my 
days and long winter evenings in An Clochan 
and who, perhaps, biased me toward an overly 
critical view of village life in the mid-1970s. Rabbit Run: Taking Leave 
The fateful visit with Martin spelled the begin­
ning of the end of my return to An Clochan. 
By the next day I was beginning to feel the 
weight of social censure closing in, not so 
much on me personally, as on those in the 
village who had taken me in -in the village 
vernacular who had 'fed me and kept me' -or 
had taken me under their wing. When S., for 
example, arrived to meet me for breakfast the 
next morning, she was in a state of consider­
able agitation. She had not slept well the pre­
vious night. 'I was awakened', she said, 'by a 
terrible nightmare. Oh, it was an awful sensa­
tion, as if my house was being invaded by a 
dark force, an ill-wind, or an alien invader.' 
She looked hesitantly to me for a clue to her 
ominous dream. I replied only that houses 
were often symbols of the body and of the self 
and left it at that. 
But that night it was my turn to be awak­
ened by a ghostly visitation, a hooded creature 
who pointed a long skinny finger over and 
beyond my head and toward the sea. Like 
Scrooge, I was happy to find myself unchanged 
in the morning and I suppressed the urge to 
hug the wooden bedstead promising: 'I am not 
the woman I was, I am not the woman I was'. 
But I knew this to be untrue in certain funda­
mental ways. And I took out. my little note­
book -the one that would ultimately prove to 
be my undoing -and jotted down a few ragged 
thoughts. 
Shaken, I continued my daily rounds of the 
village, by now heavy of heart, and uncertain 
of step. I waved to a solitary hay-mak er, the 
first one I'd seen in several days. He did not 
recognize me and he stopped to take a break. 
Making small talk I asked why the man took 
such care in making several small little hay 
cocks rather than larger haystacks. 'Because 
the hay is much sweeter this way and it pleases 
the animals more', he replied, tipping his cap 
as I walked along. After the visit with Martin 
I began to walk the country roads with my 
head bowed, practicing a government of my 
eyes so as not to elicit an automatic greeting 
from those who might later regret it. And I 
took to announcing myself at the open door 
of older friends and acquaintances: 'It's Crom 

IRE IN IRELAND 213 
Dubh, the crooked one, come back to An 
Clochan.' Indeed, I was beginning to feel very 
much like Crom Dubh, the pagan force and 
alter-ego of the village who epitomized every­
thing dark, hidden, secret, and overgrown, 
tangled among the brambles of the old grave­
yard -everything that needed to be resisted. 
My presence was a daily reminder -'salt in the 
wound' said one villager-of everything they 
would like to hide, deny and secret away. 
In fact, however, most villagers did not 
avoid me. Many fell back into the old habit of 
telling me poignant stories and catching me up 
on people, events and changes in the parish. At 
times there seemed to be a pressure, even a 
hunger to speak. Kathleen shook her head one 
evening: 'You are like the village analyst and 
we are all on the couch. We can't seem to stop 
ourselves from talking.' It made no difference 
that I was not back looking for secrets, for 
there was simply no way of escaping them. 
Since I had no other reason for being in the 
viUage except to visit with people, my presence 
became something of an obstacle, even to 
myself. In this small world, words were as 
dangerous as hand grenades or bullets, as 
much for those who gave as for those who 
received them. 
An older couple took the risk of going about 
with me in public at considerable social risk to 
themselves. It was, they said, the Christian 
thing to do, and never mind what others 
thought or said. Aiden even appointed himself 
my colleague in arms and after an a&ernoon 
of making house calls together , he commented 
wearily: 'Ah, but this fieldwork is tiring'. But 
as the situation grew more prickly I asked the 
new priest of An Clochan to help me call a 
parish meeting so that I could apologize in 
general terms for any pain I caused the com­
munity and so that villagers who wished could 
collectively express their anger. Then, I hoped, 
naively perhaps, we could clear the air and 
move forward. I explained how difficult it was 
to try to do this work of repentance and expla­
nation door to door. The priest was unsure, 
however. 'WiH you be up for it?' he mused. 
'And will they be up for it? Is this drawing too 
much attention to an old hurt? Should you 
apologize? Would this be good thing?' The 
good priest promised to mull it over with a few 
confidants in the community and he promised to get back in touch with me. 'But come to 
Mass this Sunday', he urged. When, a few days 
later, I approached the Communion line, 
Father M. held the Host up high and looked 
about him reciting my name very loudly, 
indeed: 'Nancy, receive the body and blood of 
Christ'. But after Mass he said that a parish 
meeting would be too risky and that I should 
just continue as I was doing, making my 
rounds, door to door, the best I could. As I 
walked home alone from Mass I wondered 
how much longer I should stay. 
The 'drumming' out of the village, when it 
came, was swi&. There were warning signs a 
few days before that trouble was brewing. 
Conversation would suddenly stop when 1 
entered a pub, and I would smile weakly and 
turn on my heels. During an afternoon drive I 
was taken past a few sites that had been 
subject to local harassment) including car and 
house bombings. No one had ever been hurt 
in these attacks, but the damage to property 
was considerable and the message conveyed 
was clear. The parish was controlled, in part, 
by threats and intimidation by a small but 
active group of local cultural nationalis ts. 
Among the kinds of people 'unwanted' in the 
village were British landowners, suspected 
homosexuals, purported drug dealers, 
'gombeen men' (local petty capitalis ts who 
bought up old farms) and me, that new species 
of traitor and friend, the anthropolo gist. 
My local friends were shaken by the tide of 
rejection, and they were understandably con­
flicted by divided loyalties. On the last evening 
of my stay in An Clochan I returned to my 
B&B filled with stories to share. It had been a 
good day and I had managed to make contact 
with some dear old acquaintances. My flagging 
spirits were on the rebound. But as I popped 
my head into the kitchen to tell B. that I'd be 
down for tea in a few minutes, she turned from 
the stove with a face that was flushed by more 
than the gas burners. 'I have some terrible 
new', she blurted. 'Is something wrong at 
home?' I asked, clutching at my throat. 'Did 
something happen to Michael or one of the 
children?' 'No, no, not that. But, Nancy, you 
have to leave. Right now. This evening. You 
can't eat here. You can't sleep here anymore.' 
'Did I do something wrong?' I asked. 'Did I 
offend someone in the village today?' It was 

214 NANCY SCHEPER -HUGHES 
evening, I was dog-tired, and my feet were 
sore. I had no transportation. Was it even 
possible to call up a taxi from distant TraJee 
at this hour? 'Is there anyone else who can put 
you up tonight?', B. asked. 'Let me think', I 
said stupidly , 'while I go upstairs to pack.' In 
the little attic room I moved slowly as in a 
dream, folding my few things into the suitcase 
pulled out from under the bed. I hadn't eaten 
since morning and I had missed dinner the 
evening before. So I was hungry as well as 
tired. But where could I go? Who would 
be safe from whatever intimidation B. had 
gotten? And what was she told? 'Get that 
woman out of here immediately before 
someone gets hurt'? I sat on the edge of the 
narrow bed and jotted down a few thoughts 
to clear my head. But they were so scrambled 
I tore out the page, crumpled it into a small 
wad, and tossed it carelessly into the waste­
paper basket. 
Outside night was falling. The closest home 
where I thought I might be able to stay was a 
mile away and I walked there quickly. My 
reception was kind but wary, and my new 
friend let me know, at last, that indeed the 
community as a whole had closed down where 
I was concerned. 'It's not fair', he said, 'But I 
can't not tell you that it hasn't happened. It's 
really not very good right now for anyone to 
be seen with you.' Nonetheless, he kindly 
insisted that I spend the night, or even the 
week, if I wished. He refused, he said, to be 
intimidated. 'Well, I'll go back and get my 
bags, but I will only stay until morning. And_. 
I'm so sorry for putting you in this situation.' 
'It's only a book', he said. 'And people here 
will tell you on the side that it has made them 
rethink a thing or two, for example, about 
how to raise a�d treat one's children.' And he 
laughed. "The young mothers, here, they now 
go all out of the way to nurse their babies, and 
they are forever hugging them. Just to show 
you, I sometimes think.' 
By the time I walked back to my 'guest' 
house to pick up my bags, my older friend and 
village sponsor was already waiting for me in 
the parlor. 
'Where have you been? We've been worried. 
We've worked out a solution', he said glumly. 
'You can spend your last night here-I'll see 
to it that no one blames B. -and I'll be back to fetch you first thing in the morning. Be com­
pletely ready. I'll carry you as far as Limerick 
and from there you'll take the bus to Dublin. 
No, don't argue; I insist. We can at least see 
you off to the next county. And we can use the 
extra time to talk.' 
The next morning as I crept quietly down 
the creaking stairs I found a good strong bowl 
of tea and a plate of toast waiting for me in 
the 'guest room'. Ah, I thought, it's the Lonna 
Bais, the custom of the last meal that was left 
out just before an old one dies.4 The family of 
the house had gathered around the long table 
in the kitchen for a breakfast that was taken 
in almost monastic silence. I tried to be equally 
silent in the next room. In taking my leave 
finally from B. she confronted me with my 
crime: 'All that time you spent in your room 
upstairs. You weren't just reading -you were 
. writing! You left a trail in the wastepaper 
basket. People said you were writing. They 
saw you scribbling into your note book 
outside the pub in Brandon.' 'I won't deny it', 
I said. 'But was it such a grave sin? I needed 
to write my way through my own confusion 
and loneliness.' Then, B. gave me a quick hug 
and whispered in my ear, 'I'm so sorry for this. 
Ignore them. Keep up the good work.' 
Then, the Lon na Bais ritual continued as 
my village mentor took me on our final rounds 
together of the village, this time to feast my 
eyes for the last time. Like a lo�al funeral pro­
cession, he drove me slowly past all the sites 
that were dearest to me. 'Take a good look', 
he said. 'There's your Brandon Head. And 
there's your creamery, what's left of it. And 
here is your primary school. In a few hours the 
children will be lining up to march inside. And 
here's your Peg's pub, your Tailor Dean's 
house, and your old widow Bridge's cottage 
overgrown with brambles.' Then, as we turned 
the final curve past the abandoned little hamlet 
of Ballydubh, with the village almost out of 
sight, he forced me to tum around and take in 
the full sweep of the mountains and the sea. 
'And there', he said, 'is your An Clochan. You 
had best say good-bye, now.' 
In the end perhaps we deserve each other­
well matched and well met, tougher than nails, 
both of us. Proud and stubborn, too. Unrepen­
tant meets Unforgiving. So, in a way villagers 
were right to say 'We don't believe you are 

IRE IN IRELAND 215 
really sorry.' In their view this would mean 
nothing less than a renunciation of self and of 
my vexed profession, a move I could not take. 
Saints was written from a particular perspective 
at a particular moment in time and by a partic­

Part V 
Fieldwork Conflicts, Hazards 
and Dangers 
Jeffrey A. Sluka 
Fieldwork is not free of tensions, dilemmas, conflicts, hazards, dangers, and even 
lethal hostility. Awareness of such risks is of life-saving importance to students 
embarking on their first fieldwork experience, and research troubles, even failures, 
are a source of ethnographic knowledge in themselves. In this part of the reader, 
these concerns are exemplified and addressed in June Nash's account of her expe­
rience of living through a strike in a Bolivian mining communit y, where she was 
forced to take sides with the strikers against the government at considerable per­
sonal and professional risk; a chapter on "Human Hazards of Fieldwork" from 
Nancy Howell's study of occupational safety and health in anthropology; Carolyn 
Nordstrom's reflexive account of her research on "War on the Front Lines" in 
Mozambique; and Jeffrey Sluka's article on managing danger in fieldwork, based 
on his research on the conflict in Northern Ireland. The selections by Nordstrom 
and Sluka both come from Fieldwork Under Fire: Contempor ary Studies of Vio­
lence and Survival (Nordstrom & Robben 1995), a collection of essays that explore 
the dynamics of sociopolitical violence, written by anthropolo gists who have con­
ducted fieldwork with victims, perpetrators, and survivors in war zones and other 
sites of conflict. One of the main concerns the volume addresses is the distinct 
research problems and experiences of ethnographers who study situations of vio­
lence, and the theoretical issues that emerge from studying topics that involve per­
sonal danger (Nordstrom & Robben 1995:4}. 
June Nash's fieldwork in a Bolivian tin-mining community in the early 1970s led 
to the publication of her outstanding ethnography , We Eat the Mines and the Mines 
Eat Us: Dependency and Exploitation in Bolivian Tin Mines (1979). In "Ethnology 
in a Revolutionary Setting,'' she recounts some of the difficulties, suspicions, and 
dangers she experienced while conducting her fieldwork, during a time of industrial 
unrest and political disorder. Nash was one of the first modern anthropol ogists to 
seriously address the issue of neutralit y in fieldwork, and she concluded that "In 
Bolivia it was not possible to choose the role of an impartial observer and still work 
in the tin mining communi ty ... The polarization of the class struggle made it nec­
essary to take sides or to be cast by them on one side or the other. In a revolution­
ary situation, no neutrals are allowed" (1976:150). In her research, the support and 
approval she received from the mine management aroused suspicions among the 

218 PART V: FIELDWORK CONFLIC TS, HAZARDS, AND DANGERS 
workers; when a state security agent investigated her work, she began to worry 
about the danger her notes and tapes could bring to her informants; and she even. 
tually had to respond to their growing suspicions that she was a CIA agent. These 
difficulties threatened her ability to continue her research and her personal safety. 
In the end, she was able to maintain relations with the mine management, the union, 
the tin miners, and the political authorities all at the same time, and convince the 
community she was not a CIA agent or threat. She concludes that, in revolutionary 
or violent settings, the traditional scientific attitude of impersonal objectivity is 
inappropriate and that "We can no longer retreat to the deceptive pose of neutral· 
ity" (1976:164). 
Nancy Howell's Surviving Fieldwork was the first, and so far only, comprehen· 
sive study "about anthropologists, specifica lly, about the fieldwork of anthropol­
ogy, the risks that are taken, and the prices that are paid for doing fieldwork in the 
ways we do" (1990:1}. At Howell's instigation, in 1986 the Board of Directors of 
the American Anthropological Association established an Advisory Panel on Health 
and Safety, and invited Howell to head it and produce a report on occupational 
safety and health in the discipline. This report showed that anthropolo gy can be 
dangerous and that hundreds of anthropologists have failed to protect themselv es 
from dangers and been victims of fieldwork. Field accidents and illnesses are a 
serious component of professional work in anthropol ogy. From snakebites and truck 
crashes to severe sunburn and diarrhea, fieldwork is regularly interrupted by crises 
and problems. Few fieldworkers escape harm entirely. Many are hospitalized, lose 
fieldwork time, or suffer long-term or permanent disabilities. At least sixty people 
died from fieldwork mishaps during the 1980s alone. Howell's study details the 
kinds of threats to health and safety experienced by anthropologists in the field, 
with frequencies estimated from an anonymous random sample, and illustrated by 
accounts from named volunteers who tell of their own problems. 
Surviving Fieldwork was intended to help fieldworkers anticipate the dangers they 
will face and prepare for preventing and responding to them, and includes chapters 
on various hazards, including those presented by humans and animals, exposure, 
injury, accidents, parasitic, infectious, and degenerative diseases, mental health and 
illness, families in the field, practicing medicine in the field, and making fieldwork 
safer. In the chapter "Human Hazards of Fieldwork," selected for this reader, 
Howell observes that "many anthropologists suffer interpersonal attacks during the 
course of their fieldwork" and provides descriptions and discussion of the "hazards 
of human hostility and conflict" ( 1990:89), including physical violence; rape and 
attempted rape; murder, suicide, and other mysterious deaths; political hazards, such 
as arrest and suspicion of spying; and political turmoil, such as military attack, fac­
tional conflict, hostage-taking, and assassination. 
Carolyn Nordstrom is one of the leading anthropolo gists of war and armed con­
flict. In "War on the Front Lines," based on her fieldwork in the 1980s on the front 
lines of the war in Mozambique, she explores three interrelated themes of chaos, 
the "crisis of reason," and creativity, and is particularly struck by how creative 
people are in surviving and adapting to contexts of "dirty war" where civilian pop­
ulations are targeted for terror tactics; "what may be the most powerful aspect of 
studying war is not merely the deconstructive violence that attends to it but the cre­
ativity the people on the frontlines employ to reconstruct their shattered worlds" 
(1995:131). 

INTRODUGION 219 
Nordstrom was interested in the war and Mozambicans' experience of it, and she 
argues that this research question required different field techniques than those nor­
mally associated with ethnographic studies set in specific locales or communities. 
She developed her own approach which she terms "ethnography of a war zone," 
in which the theme of war, rather than a specific locality, situates the study, and a 
focus on process and people supplants place as an ethnographic site. Rather than 
living and conducting research in one locale or communit y, she traveled the country 
extensively, visiting villages, towns, and provincial capitals, and following the war 
from urban centers to rural outposts -from "the plush offices of powerbrokers to 
the crumbling embers of villages in the far reaches of the country" (1995:144). In 
particula r, she visited locations on the front lines of the war to interview local people 
about their experiences, and she depended primarily on air travel to get there. She 
became a master of catching rides, mainly on cargo planes taking emergency sup­
plies to war-devastated areas, and dubbed this "runway anthropology" (1995:140). 
In the last two decades or so, an increasing amount of research has been carried 
out by anthropologists working in war zones and sites of sociopolitical unrest and 
violence. Nordstrom's article exempljfies some of the difficulties, hazards, and 
dangers of fieldwork in such contexts. 
In 1990, the same year Howell's Surviving Fieldwork was published, I was the 
first anthropologist to publish an article specifically on managing danger in field­
work as a methodological and subjective issue (Sluka 1990). (More recently, soci­
ologists have begun to write about danger in fieldwork; see Lee 1995, Lee-Treweek 
and Linkogle 2000.) The selection here is an updated and elaborated version of that 
1990 original article, incorporating subsequent fieldwork I conducted on the con­
flict in Northern Ireland. I begin by observing that "anthropological fieldwork is 
more dangerous today than it was in the past" and "few anthropolo gists will be 
able to avoid conflict situations and instances of sociopolitical violence in the course 
of their professional lives" (1995:276). I argue that while special ethnographic, 
methodological, theoretical, and ethical sensitivities are required when working on 
and in sites of sociopolitical conflict and violence, these dangers can be mediated 
through foresight and planning. I present a reflexive account of my fieldwork with 
Irish nationalist militants, and make practical recommendations on how to enhance 
personal safety when conducting ethnographic research in dangerous or violent 
social contexts. These recommendations are intended as "a starting point from 
which others considering fieldwork in dangerous contexts can map out their own 
strategies for conducting fieldwork safely" (1995:290). 
One of the most important conclusions is that one of the main sources of danger 
for anthropologists in the field is the nearly universal suspicion that they may be 
spies. This is an old concern in the discipline that goes back at least as far as the 
Franz Boas "Scientists as Spies" controversy in 1919. I note that: 
Because the most common suspicion that research participants have about anthropol­
ogists is that they are spies, and it is difficult to find an anthropologist who has done 
fieldwork who has not encountered this suspicion, this danger deserves special mention. 
Being defined as a spy [let alone actually being one, since death is the usual wartime 
penalty for spies] is inherently dangerous, and the link between anthropol ogy and war­
related research has exacerbated this danger. Anthropolo gists have been involved in 
war-related, particularly counterins urgency, research, others have had their research 
used or "applied" by governments, militaries, and intelligence agencies to help plan 

220 PART V: FIELDWORK CONFLiffi, HAZARDS, AND DANGERS 
military operations, and spies or intelligence agents of various sorts have used the cover 
that they were anthropologists. As a result, people in many parts of the world have 
come increasingly to believe that anthropologists, even those engaged in "'innocent, 
(or in Boas' terms "'honest,) research, are actually or potentially dangerous to them. 
Many nations and peoples are therefore justifiably suspicious of anthropologists and 
will not allow them to do research, and fieldwork has become more dangerous today 
than it was in the past. (1995�283) 
In her article on "Human Hazards of Fieldwork," Howell also highlights the danger 
that being suspected of being a spy has represented for many anthropologists, and 
in her article Nash describes how she faced and overcame a serious threat of just 
this sort. 
This issue is of particular contemporary relevance, because in 2005 the already 
considerable danger represented by anthropologists being suspected of being spies 
was exacerbated by the establishment of a new CIA scheme to sponsor trainee spies 
through American university courses. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 
terrorist attacks on the United States, the Pat Roberts Intelligence Scholars Program 
was launched to improve US intelligence-gathering capabilities. Armed with $4 
million in scholarships, it pays anthropology students, whose names are not dis­
closed, up to $50,000 a year to use their postgraduate training and fieldwork to 
gather political and cultural details on. other countries, and, after graduation, they 
are expected to go on to work directly for the CIA (Price 2005). This developm ent 
was met with anger and concern among American and British anthropologists, and, 
in particular, John Gledhill, president of Britain's Association of Social Anthropol­
ogists, called the scholarships ethically dangerous and divisive, and warned that they 
could foster suspicion within universities worldwide and cause problems in the field 
(BBC 2005). 
In 1919, Franz Boas, who for two decades had dominated American anthropol­
ogy, was formally censured by the American Anthropological Association (AAA) 
for publishing a letter in The Nation condemning anthropologists who used their 
profession as a cover for spying during World War 1: 
Sir: In his war address to congress, President Wilson dwelt at great length on the theory 
that only autocracies maintain spies; that these are not needed in democracies. At the 
time that the President made this statement, the Government of the United States had 
in its employ spies of unknown number ... The point against which I wish to enter a 
vigorous protest is that a number of men who follow science as their profession, men 
whom I refuse to designate any longer as scientists, have prostituted science by using 
it as a cover for their activities as spies. 
A soldier whose business is murder as a fine art, a diplomat whose calling is based 
on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises 
with his conscience, a business man whose aim is personal profit within the limits 
allowed by a lenient law -such may be excused if they set patriotic devotion above 
common everyday decency and perform services as spies. They merely accept the code 
of morality to whlch modern society still conforms. Not so the scientist. The very 
essence of his life is the service of truth ... [Any person] who uses science as a cover 
for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an 
investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under 
this cloak, hls political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and 
forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist. 

INTRODUCTION 221 
By accident incontrovertible proof has come to my hands that at least four men who 
carry on anthropological work, while employed as government agents, introduced 
themselves to foreign governments as representatives of scientific institutions in the 
United States, and as sent out for the purpose of carrying on scientific researches. They 
have not only shaken the belief in the truthfulness of science, but they have also done 
the greatest possible disservice to scientific inquiry. In consequence of their acts every 
nation will look with distrust upon the visiting foreign investigator who wants to do 
honest work, suspecting sinister designs. Such action has raised a new barrier against 
the development of international friendly cooperation. (1973:51-2) 
It is ironic that in 2005, at the same moment in history when the AAA membership 
was voting overwhelmingly in favor of a resolution to rescind Boas' censure in 
1919 for condemning anthropolo gists who served as spies, the largest ever 
government-sponsored program of recruiting anthropologists as spies emerged. This 
disturbing development promises to exacerbate the already considerable difficulties 
and dangers all fieldworkers face of being suspected of being spies, particularly CIA 
agents. This represents a serious threat both to anthropologists' ability to gain access 
to fieldwork sites, because it undermines our ability to gain the trust, rapport, and 
consent of research participants, and to the "occupational safety" of anthropolo­
gists in the field.
