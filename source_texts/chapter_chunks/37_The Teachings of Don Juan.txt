The Teachings of Don Juan: A 
Yaqui Way of Knowle dge 
Carlos Castaneda 
Introduction 
In the summer of 1960, while I was an anthro­
pology student at the University of California, 
Los Angeles, I made several trips to the South­
west to collect information on the medicinal 
plants used by the Indians of the area. The 
events I describe here began during one of my 
trips. I was waiting in a border town for a 
Greyhound bus, talking with a friend who had 
been my guide and helper in the survey. Sud­
denly he leaned toward me and whispered that 
the man, a white-haired old Indian, who was 
sitting in front of the window was very learned 
about plants, especially peyote. I asked my 
friend to introduce me to this man. 
My friend greeted him, then went O\'er and 
shook his hand. After they had talked for a 
while, my friend signaled me to join them, but 
immediately left me alone with the old man, 
not even bothering to introduce us. He was not 
in the least embarrassed. I told him my name 
and he said that he was called Juan and that 
he was at my service. He used the Spanish 
polite form of address. We shook hands at my 
initiative and then remained silent for some 
time. It was not a strained silence, but a quiet­
ness, natural and relaxed on both sides. 
Though his dark face and neck were wrinkled, 
showing his age, it struck me that his body was 
agile and muscular. I then told him that I was interested in 
obtaining information about medicinal plants. 
Although in truth I was almost totally ignorant 
about peyote, I found myself pretending that I 
knew a great deal, and even suggesting that it 
might be to his advantage to talk with me. As 
I rattled on, he nodded slowly and looked at 
me, but said nothing. I avoided his eyes and 
we finished by standing, the two of us, in dead 
silence. Finally, after what seemed a very long 
time, don Juan got up and looked out of the 
window. His bus had come. He said goodbye 
and left the station. 
I was annoyed at having talked nonsense 
to him, and at being seen through by those 
remarkable eyes. When my friend returned he 
tried to console me for my failure to learn any­
thing from don Juan. He explained that the old 
man was often silent or noncommittal, but the 
disturbing effect of this first encounter was not 
so easily dispelled. 
I made a point of finding out where don 
Juan lived, and later visited him several times. 
On each visit I tried to lead him to discuss 
peyote, but without success. We became, 
nonetheless, very good friends, and my scien­
tific investigation was forgotten or was at least 
redirected into channels that were worlds 
apart from my original intention. 
The friend who had introduced me to don 
Juan explained later that the old man was not

a native of Arizona, where we met, but was a 
Yaqui Indian from Sonora, Mexico. 
At first I saw don juan simply as a rather 
peculiar man who knew a great deal about 
peyote and who spoke Spanish remarkably 
well. But the people with whom he lived 
believed that he had some sort of "'secret 
knowledge," that he was a "brujo." The 
Spanish word bruio means, in English, medi­
cine man, curer, witch, sorcerer. It connotes 
essentially a person who has extraordina ry, 
and usually evil, powers. 
I had known don Juan for a whole year 
before he took me into his confidence. One 
day he explained that he possessed a certain 
knowledge that he had learned from a 
teacher, a "benefactor" as he called him, 
who had directed him in a kind of apprentice­
ship. Don juan had, in turn, chosen me to 
serve as his appr entice, but he warned me 
that I would have to make a very deep 
commitment and that the training was long 
and arduous. 
In describing his teacher, don Juan used the 
word "diablero." Later I learned that diablero 
is a term used only by the Sonoran Indians. It 
refers to an evil person who practices black 
sorcery and is capable of transforming himself 
into an animal -bird, a dog, a coyote, or any 
other creature. On one of my visits to Sonora 
I had a peculiar experience that illustrated the 
Indians' feeling about diableros. I was driving 
at night in the company of two Indian friends 
when I saw an animal that seemed to be a dog 
crossing the highway. One of my companions 
said it was not a dog, but a huge coyote. f 
slowed down and pulled to the side of the road 
to get a good look at the animal. It stayed 
within range of the headlights a few seconds 
longer and then ran into the chaparral. It was 
unmistakably a coyote, but it was twice the 
ordinary size. Talking excitedly , my friends 
agreed that it was a very unusual animal, and 
one of them suggested that it might be a dia­
blero. I decided to use an account of the ex­
perience to question the Indians of that area 
about their beliefs in the existence of diableros. 
I talked with many people, telling them the 
story and asking them questions. The three 
conversations that follow indicate what they 
felt. "Do you think it was a coyote, Choy?" I 
asked a young man after he had heard the 
story. 
"Who knows? A dog, no doubt. Too large 
for a coyote." 
"Do you think it may have been a 
diablero?" 
"That's a lot of bull. There are no such 
things." 
''Why do you say that, Choy?" 
"People imagine things. I bet if you had 
caught that animal you would have seen that 
it was a dog. Once I had some business in 
another town and got up before daybreak and 
saddled up a horse. As I was leaving I came 
upon a dark shadow on the road which looked 
like a huge animal. My horse reared, throwing 
me off the saddle. I was pretty scared too, but 
it turned out that the shadow was a woman 
who was walking to town." 
"Do you mean, Choy, that you don't believe 
there are diableros ?" 
"Diableros! Wha t's a diablero? Tell me what 
a diablero is!" 
"I don't know, Choy. Manuel, who was 
riding with me that night, said the coyote 
could have been a diablero. Maybe you could 
tell me what a diablero is?" 
"A diablero, they say, is a brujo who 
changes into any form he wants to adopt. But 
everybody knows that is pure bull. The old 
people here are full of stories about diableros. 
You won't find that among us younger 
people." 
"What kind of animal do you think it was, 
dona Luz?" I asked a middle-aged woman. 
"Only God knows for sure, but I think it 
was not a coyote. There are things that appear 
to be coyotes, but are not. Was the coyote 
runnjng, or was it eating?" 
"It was standing most of the time, but when 
I first saw it, I think it was eating something." 
•• Are you sure it was not carrying something 
in its mouth?" 
"Perhaps it was. But tell me, would that 
make any difference?" 
"Yes, it would. If it was carrying something 
in its mouth it was not a coyote." 
"What was it then?" 
"It was a man or a woman." 

THE TEACHINGS OF DON JUAN 509 
"What do you call such people, dona Luz?" 
She did not answer. I questioned her for a 
while longer, but without success. Finally she 
said she did not kn ow. I asked her if such 
people were called diableros, and she answered 
that "diablero" was one of the names given to 
them. 
"Do you know any diableros?" I asked. 
"I knew one woman/' she replied. "She was 
killed. It happened when I was a little girl. The 
woman, they said, used to turn into a female 
dog. And one night a dog went into the house 
of a white man to steal cheese. The white man 
killed the dog with a shotgun, and at the very 
moment the dog died in the house of the white 
man the woman died in her own hut. Her kin 
got together and went to the white man and 
demanded payment. The white man paid good 
money for having killed her." 
"H6w could they demand payment if it was 
only a dog he killed?" 
"They said that the white man knew it was 
not a dog, because other people were with him, 
and they all saw the dog stood up on its legs 
like a man and reached for the cheese, which 
was on a tray hanging from the roof. The men 
were waiting for the thief because the white 
man's cheese was being stolen every night. So 
the man killed the thief knowing it was not a 
dog." 
"Are there any diableros nowadays, dona 
Luz?" 
"Such things are very secret. They say there 
are no more diableros, but I doubt it, because 
one member of a diablero's family has to learn 
what the diablero knows. Diableros have their 
own laws, and one of them is that a diablero 
has to teach his secret to one of his kin.'' 
"What do you think the animal was, 
Genaro?" I asked a very old man. 
"A dog from one of the ranches of that area. 
What else?'' 
"It could have been a diablero!" 
"A diablero? You are crazy! There are no 
diableros." ' 
"Do you mean that there are none today, or 
that there never were any?" 
"At one time there were, yes. It is common 
knowledge. Everybody knows that. But the 
people were very afraid of them and had them 
all killed." "Who killed them, Genaro?" 
"All the people of the tribe. The last diablero 
I knew about was 5-. He killed dozens ' 
maybe even hundreds, of people with his 
sorcery. We couldn't put up with that and the 
people got together and took him by surprise 
one night and burned him alive." 
"How long ago was that, Gen�uo?'' 
"In nineteen forty-two." 
"Did you see it yourself?" 
"No, but people still talk about it. They 
say that there were no ashes left, even 
though the stake was made of fresh wood. All 
that was left at the end was a huge pool of 
grease." 
Although don Juan categorized his benefacror 
as a diablero, he never mentioned the pla�e 
where he had acquired his knowledge, nor did 
he identify his teacher. In fact, don Juan 
disclosed very little about hts personal life. All 
he said was that he had been born in the 
Southwest in 1891; that he had spent nearly 
all his life in Mexico; that in 1900 his family 
was exiled by the Mexi�an government to 
central Mexi�o along with thousands of other 
Sonoran Indians; and that he had lived in 
central and southern Mexico until 1940. Thus, 
as don Juan had traveled a grcar deal, his 
knowledge may have been the product of 
many influences. And although he regarded 
himself as an Indian from Sonora, I was not 
sure whether to place the context of his knowl­
edge totally in the culture of the Sonoran 
Indians. But it is not my intention here to 
determine his precise cultural milieu. 
I began to serve my apprenticeship to don 
Juan in June, 1961. Prior to that time I had 
seen him on various occasions, but always in 
the capacity of an anthropological observer . 
During these early conversations I took notes 
in a covert manner. Later, relying on my 
memory, I reconstructed the entire conversa­
tion. When I began to participate as an appren­
tice, however, that method of taking notes 
became very difficult, because our conversa­
tions touched on many different topics. Then 
don Juan allowed me -under strong protest, 
however - to record openly anything that 
was said. I would also have liked to take 
photographs and make tape recordings, but he 
would not permit me to do so. 

510 CARLOS CASTANEDA 
I carried out the apprenticeship first in 
Arizona and then in Sonora, because don Juan 
moved to Mexico during the course of my 
training. The procedure I employed was to see 
him for a few days every so often. My visits 
became more frequent and lasted longer 
during the summer months of 1961, 1962, 
1963, and 1964. In retrospect, I believe this 
method of conducting the apprenticeship pre­
vented the -training from being successful, 
because it retarded the advent of the full com­
mitment I needed to become a sorcerer. Yet 
the method was beneficial from my personal 
standpoint in that it allowed me a modicum 
of detachment, and that in turn fostered a 
sense of critical examination which would 
have been impossible to attain had I partici­
pated continuously, without interruption. ln 
September, 1965, I voluntarily discontinued 
the apprenticeship. 
Several months after my withdrawal, I consid­
ered for the first time the idea of arranging my 
field notes in a systematic way. As the data 
I had colle cted were quite voluminous, and 
included much miscellaneous information, I 
began by trying to establish a classification 
system. I divided the data into areas of related 
concepts and procedures and arranged the 
areas hierarchically according to subjective 
importance -that is, in terms of the impact 
that each of them had had on me. In that way 
I arrived at the following classification: uses of 
haJlucinogenic plants; procedures and formu­
las used in sorcery; acquisition and manipula­
tion of power objects; uses of medicinal plants; 
songs and legends. 
Reflecting upon the phenomena I had ex­
perienced, I realized that my attempt at clas­
sification had produced nothing more than an 
inventory of categories; any attempt to refine 
my scheme would therefore yield only a more 
complex inventory. That was not what I 
wanted. During the months following my 
withdrawal from the apprenticeship, I needed 
to understand what I had experienced, and 
what I had experien ced was the teaching of a 
coherent system of beliefs by means of a prag­
matic and experimental method. It had been 
evident to me from the very first session in 
which I had partici pated that don Juan' s teach­
ings possessed an internal cohesion. Once he had definitely decided to commun icate his 
knowledge to me, he proceeded to present his 
explanations in orderly steps. To discover that 
order and to understand it proved to be a most 
difficult task for me. 
My inability to arrive at an understanding 
seems to have been traceable to the fact that, 
after four years of apprenticeship, I was still a 
beginner . It was clear that don Juan's knowl­
edge and his method of conveying it were those 
of his benefactor; thus my difficulties in under­
standing his teachings must have been analo­
gous to those he himself had encountered. Don 
Juan alluded to our similarity as beginners 
through incidental comments about his in­
capacity to understand his teacher during his 
own apprenticeship. Such remarks led me to 
believe that to any beginner , Indian or non­
Indian, the knowledge of sorcery was rendered 
incomprehensible by the outlandish char acter­
istics of the phenomena he experienced. Per­
sonally, as a Western man, I found these 
characteristics so bizarre that it was virtually 
impossible to explain them in terms of my own 
everyday life, and I was forced to the conclu­
sion that any attempt to classify my field data 
in my own terms would be futile. 
Thus it became obvious to me that don 
Juan's knowledge had to be examined in terms 
of how he himself understood it; only in such 
terms could it be made evident and convinc­
ing. In trying to reconcile my own views with 
don Juan's, however, I realized that whenever 
he tried to explain his knowledge to me, he 
used concepts that would render it "intelligi­
ble" to him. As those concepts were alien to 
me, trying to understand his knowledge in the 
way he did placed me in another untenable 
position. Therefore, my first task was to deter­
mine his order of conceptualization. While 
working in that direction, I saw that don Juan 
himself had placed particular emphasis on a 
certain area of his teachings -specifical ly, the 
uses of hallucinogenic plants. On the basis of 
this realization, I revised my own scheme of 
categories. 
Don Juan used, separately and on different 
occasions, three hallucinogenic plants: peyote 
(Lophophora williamsii), Jimson weed 
(Datura inoxia syn. D. meteloides ), and a 
mushroom (possibly Psilocybe mexican.a). 
Since before their contact with Europeans, 

THE TEACH INGS OF DON JUAN 511 
American Indians have known the hallucino­
genic properties of these three plants. Because 
of their properties, the plants have been widely 
employed for pleasure, for curing, for witch­
craft, and for attaining a state of ecstasy. In 
the specific context of his teachings, don Juan 
related the use of Datura inoxia and Psilocybe 
mexicana to the acquisition of power, a power 
he called an "ally." He related the use of 
Lophophora wi/liamsii to the acquisition of 
wisdom, or the knowledge of the right way to 
live. 
The importance of the plants was, for don 
Juan, their capacity to produce stages of pecu­
liar perception in a human being. Thus he 
guided me into experiencing a sequence of 
these stages for the purpose of unfolding and 
validating his knowledge. I have called them 
"states of nonordinary reality," meaning 
unusual reality as opposed to the ordinary 
reality of everyday life. The distinction is based 
on the inherent meaning of the states of 
nonordinary reality. In the context of don 
Juan's knowledge they were considered as real, 
although their reality was differentiated from 
ordinary reality. 
Don Juan believed the states of nonordinary 
reality to be the only form of pragmatic learn­
ing and the only means of acquiring power. He 
conveyed the impression that other parts of his 
teachings were incidental to the acquisition 
of power. This point of view permeated don 
Juan's attitude toward everything not directly 
connected with the states of nonordinary 
reality. Throughout my field notes there are 
scattered references to the way don Juan felt. 
For example, in one conversation he suggested 
that some objects have a certain amount of 
power in themselves. Although he himself had 
no respect for power objects, he said they were 
frequently used as aids by lesser brujos. I often 
asked him about such objects, but he seemed 
totally uninterested in discussing them. When 
the topic was raised again on another occa­
sion, however, he reluctantly consented to talk 
about them. 
"There are certain objects that are perme­
ated with power,'' he said. "There are scores 
of such objects which are fostered by power­
ful men with the aid of friendly spirits. These 
objects are tools -not ordinary tools, but tools of death. Yet they are only instruments; they 
have no power to teach. Properly speaking, 
they are in the realm of war objects designed 
for strife; they are made to kill, to be hurled." 
"What kind of objects are they, don Juan?" 
"They are not really objects; rather, they are 
types of power." 
"How can one get those types of power, don 
Juan?" 
"That depends on the kind of object you 
want." 
"How many kinds are there?" 
•• As I have already said, there are scores of 
them. Anything can be a power object." 
"Well, which are the most powerful, then?" 
"The power of an object depends on its 
owner, on the kind of man he is. A power 
object fostered by a lesser brujo is almost a 
joke; on the other hand, a strong, powerful 
brujo gives his strength to his tools . ., 
"Which power objects are most common, 
then? Which ones do most brujos prefer?'' 
"There are no preferences. They are all pow­
erful objects, all just the same." 
"Do you have any yourself , don juan?" 
He did not answer; he just looked at me and 
laughed. He remained quiet for a long time, and 
I thought my questions were annoying him. 
"There are limitations on those types of 
powers," he went on ... But such a point is, I 
am sure, incomprehensible to you. It has taken 
me nearly a lifetime to understand that, by 
itself, an ally can reveal all the secrets of these 
lesser powers, rendering them rather childish. 
I had tools like that at one time, when I was 
very young." 
"What power objects did you have?" 
'' Maiz-pmto, crystals, and feathers." 
"What is mafz-pinro, don Juan?" 
"'It is a small kernel of corn which has a 
streak of red color in its middle." 
"Is it a single kernel?'' 
"No. A brujo owns forty-eight kernels.'' 
"What do the kernels do, don Juan?" 
"Each one of them can kill a man by enter-
ing into his body., 
"How does a kernel enter into a human 
body?" 
"It is a power object and its power consists, 
among other things, in entering into the body." 
.. What does it do when it enters into rhe 
body?" 

512 CARLOS CASTANEDA 
"It immerses itself in the body; it settles on 
the chest, or on the intestines. The man 
becomes ill, and unless the brujo who is 
tending him is stronger than the bewitcher, he 
will die within three months from the moment 
the kernel entered into h_is body." 
"Is there any way of curing him?" 
"The only way is to suck the kernel out, but 
very few brujos would dare to do that. A brujo 
may succeed in sucking the kernel out, but 
unless he is powerful enough to repel it, it will 
get inside him and will kill him instead.'' 
"But how does a kernel manage to enter into 
someone's body?" 
"To explain that I must tell you about corn 
witchcraft, which is one of the most powerful 
witchcrafts I know. The witchcraft is done by 
two kernels. One of them is put inside a fresh 
bud of a yellow flower. The flower is then set 
on a spot where it will come into contact with 
the victim: the road on which he walks every 
day, or any place where he is habitually 
present. As soon as the victim steps on the 
kernel, or touches it in any way, the witchcraft 
is done. The kernel immerses itself in the 
body." 
"What happens to the kernel after the man 
has touched it?" 
"All its power goes inside the man, and the 
kernel is free. It becomes just another kernel. 
It may be left at the site of the witchcra ft, or 
it may be swept away; it does not matter. It is 
better to sweep it away into the underbrush, 
where a bird will eat it." 
"Can a bird eat it before the man touches 
it?" 
"'No. No bird is that stupid, I assure you. 
The birds stay away from it." 
Don Juan then described a very complex 
procedure by which such power kernels can be 
obtained. 
"You must bear in mind that maiz-pinto is 
merely an instrument, not an ally," he said. 
"Once you make that distinction you will have 
no problem. But if you consider such tools to 
be supreme, you will be a fool." 
"Are the power objects as powerful as an 
ally?" I asked. 
Don Juan laughed scornfully before answer­
ing. It seemed that he was trying hard to be 
patient with me. "Maiz-pinto, crystals, and feathers are mere 
toys in comparison with an ally," he said. 
"These power objects are necessary only when 
a man does not have an ally. It is a waste of 
time to pursue them, especially for you. You 
should be trying to get an ally; when you 
succeed, you will understand what I am telling 
you now. Power objects are like a game for 
children." 
"Don't get me wrong, don Juan," I 
protested. "I want to have an ally, but I also 
want to know everything I can. You yourself 
have said that knowledge is power." 
"No!,, he said emphatically . "Power rests on 
the kind of knowledge one holds. What is the 
sense of knowing things that are useless?" 
In don Juan's system of beliefs, the acquisition 
of an ally meant exclusively the exploitation of 
the states of nonordinary reality he produced 
in me through the use of hallucinogenic plants. 
He believed that by focusing on these states 
and omitting other aspects of the knowledge 
he taught I would arrive at a coherent view of 
the phenomena I had experienced. 
I have therefore divided this book into two 
parts. In the first part I present selections from 
my field notes dealing with the states of nonor­
dinary reality I underwent during my appren­
ticeship. As I have arranged my notes to fit the 
continuity of the narrative, they are not always 
in proper chronological sequence. I never 
wrote my description of a state of nonordinary 
reality until several days after I had experi­
enced it, waiting until I was able to treat it 
calmly and objectively . My conversations with 
don Juan, however, were taken down as they 
occurred, immediately after each state of 
nonordinary reality. My reports of these con­
versations, therefore, sometimes antedate the 
full description of an experience. 
My field notes disclose the subjective version 
of what I perceived while undergoing the expe­
rience. That version is presented here just as I 
narrated it to don Juan, who demanded a com­
plete and faithful recollection of every detail 
and a full recounting of each experience. At the 
time of recording these experiences, I added 
incidental details in an attempt to recapture 
the total sett_ing of each state of nonordinary 
reality. I wanted to describe the emotional 

THE TEACHINGS OF DON JUAN 513 
impact I had experienced as completely as 
possible. 
My field nores also reveal the content of don 
Juan's system of beliefs. I have condensed long 
papers of questions and answers between don 
Juan and myself in order to avoid reproducing 
the repetitiveness of conversation. But as I also 
want to reflect accurately the overall mood of 
our exchanges, I have deleted only dialogue 
that contribut ed nothing to my understanding 
of his way of knowledge. The information 
don juan gave me about his way of knowledge 
was always sporadic, and for every spurt on 
his part there were hours of probing on mine. Nevertheless, there were innumerable 
occasions on which he freely expounded his 
knowledge. 
In the second pan of this book I present a 
structural analysis drawn exclusively from the 
data reported in the first part. Through my 
analysis I seek to support the following con­
tentions: (1) don Juan presented his teachings 
as a system of logical thought; (2) the system 
made sense only if examined in the light of its 
structural units; and (3) the system was devised 
to guide an apprentice to a level of conceptu­
alization which explained the order of the phe­
nomena he had experienced.
