Being There ... and There ... 
and There! Reflections on 
Multi-Site Ethnography 
Ulf Hannerz 
In 1950, Professor Edward Evans-Pritchard, 
not yet 'Sir' but certainly a central figure in 
mid-century anthropol ogy, gave a radio lecture 
on the BBC Third Programme where he out­
lined what an Oxford man (no doubt here 
about gender) would properly do to become 
an accomplished fieldworker in social anthro­
pology. Having prepared himself meticulously 
for a couple of years, and if fortunate enough 
to get a research grant, the anthropologist­
to-be would proceed to his chosen primitive 
society to spend there usually two years, 
preferably divided into two expeditjons with a 
few months in between, if possible in a uni­
versity department where he could think about 
his materials. In the field, Evans-Prit chard's 
anthropologist would throughout be in close 
contact with the people among whom he was 
working, he must communicate with them 
solely through their own language, and he 
must study their 'entire culture and social life'. 
For one thing, the long period in the field 
would allow observations to be made at every 
season of the year. Having returned home, it 
would take the anthropologist at least another 
five years to publish the results of his research, 
so the study of a single society could be reck­
oned to require 10 years. And then, Evans-Pritchard concluded, a study of a second 
society was desirable -lest the anthropologist 
would think for the rest of his life in terms of 
a particular type of society (Evans-Pritchard, 
1951: 64ff). 
The idea of such a thorough, formative, 
exclusive engagement with a single field is of 
course at the base of the enduring power in 
anthropology of the prospect, or experience, 
or memory, or simply collectively both cele­
brated and mystified notion, of 'being there'.1 
Something much like Evans-Pritchard' s pre­
scription has very long remained more or less 
the only fully publicly acknowl edged model 
for fieldwork, and for becoming and being a 
real anthropologist. Perhaps, it works with full 
force especially in the continued instruction of 
newcomers in the discipline -in many ways I 
conformed to it myself in my first field study, 
in an African American neighborhood in 
Washington, DC, although that was something 
quite different from Evans-Pritchard' s classic 
'primitive society'. Yet the hegemony of the 
model seems remarkable since it is fairly clear 
that a great many anthropolo gists, especially 
those no longer in the first phase of their 
careers, have long, but perhaps a bit more dis­
creetly, been engaging in a greater variety of

spatial and temporal practices as they have 
gone about their research. It may have been 
onJy Gupta and Ferguson's Anthropological 
Locations (1997) that really brought this 
variety entirely into the open. (I realize, cer­
tainly, that the power of the model has not 
been as strong among the ethnographically 
inclined in other disciplines, not so fully 
exposed to it, and obviously working under 
other conditions.) 
So it may be, then, that when the concep­
tion of multi-site fieldwork -being there ... 
and there ... and there! -propagated most 
consistently by George Marcus (e.g. 1986, 
1995), first gained wider recognition in 
anthropology in the later years of the 20th 
century, it was not really so entirely innova­
tive. For one thing, in studies of migration, it 
was already becoming an established ideal to 
'be there' at both points of departure and 
points of arrival (see e.g. Watson, 1977), thus 
working at least bilocally. Nor should we dis­
regard the fact that the real pioneer of inten­
sive anthropological fieldwork, Malinowskj, 
was already going multilocal when he followed 
the Trobrianders along the Kula ring. Yet the 
very fact that this style of doing ethnography 
was given a label, and prominently advocated, 
and exemplified (if in large part by borrowing 
a case from journalism), and that trus occurred 
much at the same time as ideas of place and 
the local were coming under increasing 
scrutiny in and out of anthropol ogy, no doubt 
helped accelerate its recent spread, as a prac­
tice or as a topic of argument. 
Whether due to convergent interests or 
mutual inspiration, a number of my colleagues 
in Stockholm and I were among those who 
fairly quickly saw possibilities in configuring 
our projects along multilocal lines. One of us 
studied the organizational culture of Apple 
Computer in Silicon Valley, at the European 
headquarters in Paris, and at the Stockholm 
regional office; another studied the occupa­
tional world of ballet dancers in New York, 
London, Frankfurt and Stockholm; a third 
connected to the Armenian diaspora across 
several continents; a fourth explored the emer­
gent profession of interculturalists, what I have 
elsewhere a little facetiously referred to as the 
•culture shock prevention industry'; and so on. We debated the characteristics of multilocal 
field studies fairly intensely among ourselves 
and with other colleagues, and a book some 
10 of us put together on our projects and expe­
riences, particularly for teaching purposes, 
may have been the first more extended treat­
ment of the topic (Hannerz, 2001a). As far as 
I am concerned myself, perhaps lagging a little 
behind my more quickly-moving colleagues 
and graduate students, my involvement with 
multi-site work has been primarily through a 
study of the work of news media foreign cor­
respondents which I will draw on here.2 
Among the Foreign 
Correspondents 
The general background was that some 20-25 
years ago I rather serendipitously drifted into 
the area which later came to be known as 
'globalization' through a local study of a West 
African town, and then spent some time in 
large part thinking about the anthropo logy of 
the global ecumene in more conceptual and 
programmatic terms. By the time my itch to 
return to fieldwork combined with an actual 
opportunity to do so, several of us in Stock­
holm were concerned with 'globalization at 
work' -that is, responding to the fact that a 
large proportion of existing or emergent 
transnational connections are set up in occu­
pational life. (This meant that we could also 
find food for thought in occupational ethnog­
raphy outside anthropolo gy, not least in the 
Chicago sociological tradition of Everett 
Hughes, Howard Becker and others.) More 
specifically , my own project could draw on the 
fact that I am a life-time news addict, and 
assumed as I began to think about it that if 
globalization was also a matter of becoming 
more aware of the world, and having more 
elaborated understandings of the world, 
'foreign news' would be a central source of 
such understandings. 3 Perhaps most con­
cretely, my curiosity fastened on some of the 
reporting I was habitually exposed to, for 
example when listening to the morning news 
program on the radio while having breakfast, 
and trying to wake up. There -this would 
have been in the mid-1990s- a familiar voice

would report on street riots in Karachi, or the 
latest triumph of the expanding Taliban ... 
and then sign off from Hong Kong. There are 
people, then, such as 'Asia correspondents', or 
'Africa correspondents'. These are also people, 
clearly, engaged in an occupational practice of 
'being there ... and there ... and there'-and 
sometimes possibly even appearing to be 
where they are not, if for example they can 
make a Karachi street scene come alive in their 
reporting even when they quite clearly are at a 
desk thousands of miles away from it. But just 
how do they do it? 
I should say that as I was becoming seriously 
attracted to the idea of doing something like 
an ethnography of the social world of foreign 
correspondents, I was still a bit ambivalent. I 
found that on my shelves I already had some 
number of the kind of autobiographies some 
correspondents do, usually probably as their 
careers begin approaching an end; and I had 
seen most of those movies which over the years 
have turned the foreign correspondent into a 
kind of popular culture hero. As the saying 
goes, 'anthropo logists value studying what 
they like and liking what they study' (Nader, 
1972:. 303)-and I wondered whether I would 
find foreign correspondents unapproachable, 
or perhaps arrogant prima donnas, or just pos­
sibly too suspicious of an academic who they 
might fear would always be inclined to carping 
criticisms of their work. 
As it turned out, I need not really have 
worried. I did a series of pilot interviews in 
New York during a period when I found 
myself there as the field spouse of another 
multi-site ethnographer , and the journalists I 
talked to there, having made first contacts 
through anthropologist mutual acquaintances, 
were very hospitable and encouraging. (The 
only thing I found a bit funny was that so 
many of them were Pulitzer Prize winners.) 
And that is how it continued to be. In the 
following years I engaged in a series of con­
versations with foreign correspondents and, 
sometimes, strictly speaking, excorrespon­
dents, mostly in Jerusalem, Johanne sburg and 
Tokyo, but also in some number of other 
places including New York and Los Angeles, 
where I seized on the opportunity which some 
other kind of trip provided, to add another handful of interviews. Altogether , I talked to 
some 70 correspondents, and a few foreign 
news editors offering the perspective from 
headquarters. 
As I see it, an ethnography of foreign news 
work of my kind can attempt to fill a note­
worthy gap between two sets of representa­
tions of international news. At least since the 
1970s, when a critical awareness grew of the 
communication imbalances in the world, it has 
been recurrently noted that the apparatus of 
global news flow is in large part controlled by 
what we have described as either 'the West' or 
'the North' -the obvious examples of such 
dominance have been major news agencies 
such as Reuters or the Associated Press, with 
CNN more recently added as another key 
symbol of the apparatus. The other set of rep­
resentations I have in mind consists of those 
memoirs by the newspeople themselves which 
I just referred to. These tend to be quite 
individual- centered, focusing on the authors as 
men and women of action, facing all kinds of 
dangers as they struggle to file their reports 
from the trouble spots of the world. 
The gap, then, is one between foreign cor­
respondents represented as puppets and as 
heroes. In the heavily macro-orie nted views of 
media imperialism, the individuals who would 
be its flesh-and-blood representatives at the 
outer reaches of the newshandling apparatus 
are hardly seen as anything other than anony­
mous, exchangeable tools. In the autobio­
graphical genre, in contrast, the individuals 
tend to the strong, the wider structure of news 
reporting not so noticeable. 
Certainly my study of the foreign corre­
spondents reflects the asymmetry in the global 
landscape of news. I deal mostly with Euro­
peans and Americans, reporting from parts of 
the world which do not send out a comparable 
number of correspondents of their own to 
report from other places. In large part, this 
obviously matches the classic asymmetry of 
anthropology; and my choice of Jerusalem, 
Johannesburg and Tokyo as main field sites 
also reflects an interest in the way foreign cor­
respondents, on a parallel track to ours, deal 
with issues of 'translating culture', of 'repre­
senting the other'. Apart from that, however, 
we face here once more the problem of strik-

362 ULF HANNERZ 
ing a balance between structure and agency. 
What I have attempted to do in my study is to 
portray the networks of relationships more 
immediately surrounding the foreign corre­
spondents, locally or translocally; the patterns 
of collaboration, competition and division of 
labor which organize their daily activities, for­
mally or informally; and not least their room 
for maneuver and personal preferences in 
reporting. I have been curious about the part­
nerships which evolve between correspondents 
who prefer each other as company when going 
on reporting trips, and about the relationships 
between correspondents and local 'fixers', 
reminding me of the multifaceted links between 
anthropo logists and their field assistants. 
I have explored, too, the often obscure pas­
sages of news in roundabout ways between 
news agencies, electronic media and print 
media, which sometimes offer convenient 
shortcuts in correspondent work but which 
also generate tensions and now and then back­
stage satirical comment about recycling and 
plagiarism. And not least have I been con­
cerned with the implications of career patterns 
and with the spatial organization of foreign 
correspondence. How might it matter to 
reporting that some correspondents spend 
most of a life time in a single posting, while 
others are rotated every three years or so, 
between countries and continents? When large 
parts of the world get only brief visits by cor­
respondents, described on such occasions as 
'parachutists' or 'firemen', and only when 
there is a crisis to cover, how does this shape 
their and our view of these lands? 
I am not going to devote my space here to 
any great extent, however, to discuss the 
specifics of my own project. I will rather try, 
against the background of this experience and 
that of some of my colleagues, to spell out a 
few of the issues which characteristically arise 
in multi-site ethnography , and ways in which 
it is likely to differ from the established model 
of anthropological field study, as I have let the 
latter be represented above by Evans-Pritchard 
and his half-century old formulation. For I 
believe that in arguments over the worth of 
multiJocal work, it is not always made entirely 
transparent how it relates to the assumptions 
based on classic understandings of 'being 
there'. Constituting the 
Multi-Site Field 
In a way, one might argue, the term 'multilo­
cal' is a little misleading, for what current mul­
tilocal projects have in common is that they 
draw on some problem, some formulation of 
a topic, which is significantly translocal, not to 
be confined within some single place. The sites 
are connected with one another in such ways 
that the relationships between them are as 
important for this formulation as the relation­
ships within them; the fields are not some mere 
collection of local units. One must establish 
the translocal linkages, and the intercon­
nections between those and what ever local 
bundles of relationships which are also part of 
the study. 4 In my foreign correspondent study, 
a major such linkage was obviously between 
the correspondents abroad and the editors at 
home. But then there was also the fact that the 
correspondents looked sideways, toward other 
news sites and postings, and sometimes moved 
on to these. They often knew colleagues in 
some number of other such sites, having been 
stationed in the same place some time earlier, 
or by meeting somewhere on one or more of 
those 'fireman' excursions which are a cele­
brated part of the public imagery of foreign 
correspondence, or by working for the same 
organization. In some loose sense, there is a 
world-wide 'community' of foreign correspon­
dents, connected through local and long­
distance ties. 
These linkages make the multi-site study 
something di fferent from a mere comparative 
study of localities (which in one classical mode 
of anthropological comparison was based pre­
cisely on the assumption that such linkages did 
not exist). Yet certainly comparisons are often 
built into multi-site research. My colleague 
Christina Gars ten ( 1994 ), in her study of three 
sites within the transnational organization of 
Apple, was interested in comparing center and 
periphery within the corporation, as well as 
the way company culture in the offices was 
influenced by national cultures. As Helena 
Wulff (1998) studied the transnational ballet 
world she was similarly interested in national 
dance styles, but also in the differences 
between those companies in large part sup-

ported by the state and those working more 
entirely in the market. In my own study I could 
note the differences in foreign correspondent 
work between Jerusalem, where close at hand 
there was an almost constant stream of events 
commanding world attention; Tokyo, where it 
was a certain problem for correspondents that 
much of the time nothing really newsworthy 
seemed to happen; and Johannesbur g, where 
designated 'Africa correspondents' based there 
would mostly travel to other parts of the con­
tinent when there was a war or a disaster to 
report on. 
If we could make use of the possibilities for 
comparison, however , neither I nor my col­
leagues could claim to have an ethnographic 
grasp of the entire 'fields' which our chosen 
research topics may have seemed to suggest ­
and this tends to be in the nature of multi-site 
ethnography. It may be that in a migration 
study where all the migrants leave the same 
village and then turn up in the same proletar­
ian neighborhood in a distant city, the poten­
tial and the actual combinations of sites are the 
same. On the other hand, a multinational cor­
poration has many branches, ballet companies 
exist in a great many cities, a diaspora like that 
of the Armenians is widely dispersed, and 
foreign correspondents are based in major 
clusters in some 20-25 places around the 
world (disregarding here those temporar y con­
centrations which result when the 'firemen' 
descend on a remote and otherwise mostly 
neglected locus of hard news). Consequent ly, 
multi-site ethnography almost always entails a 
selection of sites from among those many 
which could potentially be included. Evans­
Pritchard may not actually have been every­
where in Azandeland or Nuer country, but this 
would hardly be as immediately obvious as the 
selectiveness, or incompleteness, of the multi­
site study, where potential sites are clearly sep­
arate from one another. 
The actual combination of sites included in 
a study may certainly have much to do with a 
research design which focuses on particular 
problems, or which seeks out particular oppor­
tunities for comparison. When I chose the 
somewhat exotic sites of Jerusalem, Johannes­
burg and Tokyo, it was because I was inter­
ested in reporting over cultural distances -I 
would have been less attracted by reporting between, say, Brussels and Stockholm, or 
between London and New York. Yet I wonder 
if it is not a recurrent characteristic of multi­
site ethnography that site selections are to an 
extent made gradually and cumulat ively, as 
new insights develop, as opportunities come 
into sight, and to some extent by chance. I had 
originally had in mind including India in my 
study, but then the first time I was planning to 
go a national election was called there, and 
while that could have been an attractive field 
experience, I suspected it would be a time 
when correspondents would have little time 
for me. Then the second time an ailment of my 
own made the streets of Delhi seem a less 
appealing prospect. To begin with, I had not 
expected to include Tokyo in my study, 
although it turned out to be a very good 
choice. But in no small part I went there 
because I had an invitation to a research work­
shop in Japan at a time when I could also stay 
on for some research. 
Questions of Breadth and 
Relationships 
Evans-Pritchard' s anthropologist, again, 
would study the 'entire culture and social life' 
of the people assigned to him. Being around 
for at least a year, he could make observations 
during all seasons, and he would work in the 
local languag e (although it would probably be 
true that it was a language which in large part 
he had to learn during that year). And then, 
having spent, everything included, a decade of 
his life on that study, one could hope that there 
would also be time left for getting to know 
another people. 
This is the kind of image of 'real' fieldwork 
which tends to worry current practitioners of, 
and commentators on, multi-site studies in 
anthropolo gy. Compared to such standards, 
are these studies inevitably of dubious quality? 
lf you are involved with two, three or even 
more places in much the same time span that 
classical anthropology would allow for one, 
which for various practical reasons rna y now 
be the case, what can you actually do? I do not 
want to assert that no problems of depth and 
breadth arise, that no dilemmas are inevitably 
there to be faced. Yet it is important that we 

364 ULF HANNERZ 
realize how one site in a multi-site study now 
differs from the single site of that mid-20th 
century anthropologist. 
I was in Jerusalem and Johannesburg and 
Tokyo, and more marginally in several other 
places, but I was clearly not trying to study the 
'entire culture and social life' of these three 
cities. I was merely trying to get to know some 
number of the foreign newspeople stationed in 
them, and the local ecology of their activities. 
In fact, I was not trying hard to get to know 
these individuals particularly intimately either; 
what mattered to me about their childhood or 
family lives or personal interests was how these 
might affect their foreign correspondent work. 
Anthropologists often take a rather roman­
tic view of their fields and their relationships 
to people there. They find it difficult to 
describe their informants as informants 
because they would rather see them as friends, 
and they may be proud to announce that they 
have been adopted into families and kin 
groups -not only because it suggests some­
thing about their skills as fieldworkers, but 
also because it carries a moral value. They 
have surrendered to the field, and have been in 
a way absorbed by it. (Evans-Pritchard [1951: 
79] shared similar sentiments: 'An anthropol­
ogist has failed unless, when he says goodbye 
to the natives, there is on both sides the sorrow 
of parting'.) Perhaps it is for similar reasons 
that I much prefer describing my encounters 
with correspondents as conversations, suggest­
ing a more personal quality, rather than as 
interviews, although I certainly also want to 
convey the idea of only rather mildly struc­
tured exchanges, with room for spontaneous 
flow and unexpected turns. 
There is no doubt a time factor involved in 
how relationships evolve. Yet I believe most 
multi-site studies really also have built-in 
assumptions about segmented lives, where 
some aspect (work, ethniciry or something 
else) is most central to the line of inquiry, and 
other aspects are less so. The ethnographer 
may be interested in the embeddedness of a 
particular line of belief or activity in a wider 
set of circumstances, but this hardly amounts 
to some holistic ambition. It is a pleasure if one 
discovers a kindred soul, but one keeps hard­
nosedly in mind what more precisely one is 
after, and what sorts of relationships are char­
acteristic of the field itself, as one delineates it. To some extent personalizing encounters in 
the modern, muJti-site field comes not so much 
from deepening particular interactions as from 
the identification of common acquai ntances -
form placing the ethnographer in the translo­
cal network of relationships. Meeting with 
foreign correspondents, I have sensed that it is 
often appreciated when it turns out that I have 
also talked to friends and colleagues of theirs 
in some other part of the world; perhaps more 
recently than they have. Or even to their editor 
at home. As I have tried to include informants 
from the same news organization in different 
postings, to develop my understanding of its 
operations and as a kind of triangulation, such 
connections can be discovered fairly often and 
easily. It is a matter of establishing personal 
credentials. 
Site Temporalities 
Anthropology's classic image of fieldwork also 
includes an assumption about the durability of 
fields, and the involvement of 'natives' in them, 
relative to the length of the ethnographe r's 
field stay. At least implicitly there is the notion 
that the ethnograph er, alone a transient, has to 
develop in that year or two the understandin gs 
which match what the locals assemble during 
a life time. That year, moreover, covers the 
most predictable variation that one finds in 
local life: that of seasons. 
Obviously the people we are concerned with 
in present day field studies tend mostly to be 
less dependent on seasons and their cycles of 
activity -on planting and harvesting, or on 
moving herds to greener pastures. But in addi­
tion, these people themselves often have other 
kinds of relationships to the site than that of 
real 'natives'. In Evans-Pritchard's time, the 
Azande and the Nuer among whom he mostly 
worked were pedestrians -in a life-time they 
did not go all that far away. There may be some 
such people in Jerusalem, Johannesburg and 
Tokyo as well, but hardlY. among the foreign 
correspondents. And generally the people on 
whom we focus in multi-site field studies tend 
to be the more mobile ones, those who con­
tribute most to turning the combinations of 
sites into coherent fields, and who also make the 
sites themselves, at least for the purposes of the 
studies, more like 'translocalities' (Appadurai, 

REFLECTIONS ON MULTI-SITE ETHNOGRAPHY 365 
1996). Some of the sites may even in themselves 
be short-lived phenomena. My Stockholm 
colleague Tommy Dahlen ( 1997), studying the 
making of the new interculturalist profession, 
found international conferences, including 
ritual events, workshops, exhibits and parties, 
central to his ethnograp hy. And by the time his 
study was over, he had surely attended more of 
these conferences than most intercuhuralists. 
Such temporary sites -conferences, courses, 
festivals -are obviously important in much 
contemporary ethnograp hy. 
In some sites now, this goes to say, there are 
no real natives, or at any rate fewer of them, 
sharing a life-time's localized experience and 
collectivized understandings. There are more 
people who are, like the anthropologist, more 
like strangers. I find thought-provoking James 
Ferguson's (1999: 208) comment on what 
ethnography on the urban Zambian Copper­
belt was like toward the end of the 20th 
century: 
Here there is much to be understood, but none 
of the participants in the scene can claim to 
understand it all or even take it all in. Every­
one is a little confused (some more than 
others, to be sure), and everyone finds some 
things that seem clear and others that are 
unintelligible or only partially intelligible ... 
Anthropological understanding must take on 
a djfferent character when to understand 
things like the natives is to miss most of what 
IS gomg on. 
This can be as true in single-site as in multi­
site studies, but it problem atizes the relation­
ship between 'native' and ethnographer 
knowledge. Do things become easier for field­
workers if their informants also find the 
world opaque, or more difficult as they 
have to understand not only the structure of 
knowledge such as it is, but also the nature and 
social organization of ignorance and misun­
derstandings? In any case, we sense that we 
have moved away from the classic fieldwork 
model. 
Materials: Interviews, 
Observations, Etc. 
Again, in my foreign correspondent project, 
interviews, be they long, informal and loosely ordered, were a large part of my field materi­
als. I did sit in on a daily staff meeting of the 
foreign desk at one newspaper , and went on a 
reporting trip to the Palestinian West Bank 
with one correspondent. More materials of 
these and other kinds would no doubt have 
been of value, but for practical reasons I did 
not pursue some such possibilities, using the 
time at my disposal rather to ensure diversity 
through the interviews. (I tried to include 
different kinds of media, although with an 
emphasis on print correspondents, and I 
wanted to include a reasonably broad range of 
nationalities.) Also, as in Jerusalem, Johannes­
burg and Tokyo, and to a more limited extent 
in a couple of other places, I met with corre­
spondents as they were immersed in the activ­
ities of a particular beat, and the interviews 
could be detailed and concrete. 
Probably the time factor has a part in 
making many multi-site studies rather more 
dependent on interviews than single-site 
studies. If the researchers have to handle more 
places in the time classic fieldwork would 
devote to one, they may be more in a hurry. 
Language skills also probably play a part. In 
interviews, it is more likely that you can 
manage in one or two languages. My conver­
sations with foreign correspondents were in 
English, except for those with fellow Scandi­
navians. In those sites, for many of the corre­
spondents -particularly those who were 
expatriates, rotating between assignments -
English was their working language as well. 
George Marcus (1995: 101) concludes that 
most multi-sited field studies so far have been 
carried out in monolingual, mostly English­
speaking settings. 
This is surely not to say that multi-site 
ethnography must rely entirely on interviewing 
and informant work (in which case some 
might even feel that in the field phase, it is less 
than fully ethnographic -the ethnographic 
tendency may become more obvious in the 
style of writing); this still depends on the 
nature of research topics. Studying ballet com­
panies, Helena Wulff could view performances 
and sit in on endless rehearsals. Although she 
could not very well 'participate' in the public 
performances, her own dance background 
meant that she still had a particular empathetic 
insight into the more practical, bodily aspects 
of dancing lives. 

366 ULF HANNERZ 
But then if pure observation, or participant 
observation, has a more limited part in some 
multi-site studies than in the classic model of 
anthropological fieldwork, it may not have so 
much to do with sheer multi-sitedness as with 
the fact that they tend to involve settings of 
modernity. There are surely a great many 
activities where it is worthwhile to be imme­
diately present, even actively engaged, but also 
others which may be monotonous, isolated, 
and difficult to access. What do you do when 
'your people' spend hours alone at a desk, 
perhaps concentrating on a computer screen? 
At the same time, whatever you may now do 
along more classic ethnographic lines can be, 
often must be, combined with other kinds of 
sources and materials. Hugh Gusterson (1997: 
116), moving on personally from an ethnog­
raphy of one California nuclear weapons 
laboratory to a study of the entire American 
'nuclear weapons community', and looking 
intermittently at the counterpart Russian 
community as well, describes contemporary 
ethnography as a matter of 'polymorphous 
engagements' -interacting with informants 
across a number of dispersed sites, but also 
doing fieldwork by telephone and email, col­
lecting data eclectically in many different ways 
from a disparate array of sources, attending 
carefully to popular culture, and reading news­
papers and official documents. Skills of syn­
thesis may become more important than ever. 
Certainly it is in considerable part relation­
ships which are not, or at least not always, of 
a face-to-face nature which make the multi-site 
field cohere. Media, personal or impersonal, 
seem to leave their mark on most multi-site 
studies. Ulf Bjorklund {200 1: 100 ), my col­
league engaged in studying the Armenian 
diaspora, quotes an editor explaining that 
'wherever in the world there are two dozen 
Armenians, they publish some kind of paper'. 
Helena Wulff describes the varied ways in 
which dance videos are used in the transna­
tional dance communit y, including instruction 
as well as marketing. In my foreign corre­
spondent study, the correspondents' reporting 
itself naturally makes up a large part of my 
materials, interweaving with my interviews. In 
the end, too, this means that Evans-Pritchard's 
words about the 'sorrow of parting' seem just 
a little less to the point. Just as their reporting could allow me to know at least something 
about them before meeting them in the flesh, 
so I could also to a degree keep track of them 
thereafter by following their reporting, from 
the sites where I met them or from elsewhere 
in the world, as I was back in Stockholm. 
An Art of the Possible: 
Fitting Fieldwork 
into Lives 
The pilot interviews apart, I began field studies 
for my foreign correspondent project in late 
1996, and did the last interview in early 2000. 
In a way, then, I could seem to come close to 
Evans-Pritchard' s five-year norm for a project, 
but that did not really include my preparatory 
work, nor time for writing up. On the other 
hand, I was not at all working full time on the 
project. In between, I was back in Stockholm 
engaged in teaching and administration, and 
also had a couple of brief but gratifying 
research fellowships elsewhere. But all the 
time, of course, I was following the reporting 
of foreign news. 
Whether it is single-site or multi-site, I am 
convinced that much ethnographic work is 
now organized rather like that. Professional or 
domestic obligations make the possibility of 
simply taking off for a field for a continuous 
stretch of another year or two appear rather 
remote. For some that means never going to 
the field again, so there is no 'second society' 
experience of the kind which would suppos­
edly broaden your intellectual horizons. Bur 
then ethnography is an art of the possible, and 
it may be better to have some of it than none 
at all. And so we do it now and then, fitting ic 
into our lives when we have a chance. 
Often, no doubt, this will be a matter of 
being there -and again! and again! -return­
ing to a known although probably changing 
scene. Multi-site ethnography , howev er, may 
fit particularly well into. that more drawn-our, 
off-and-on kind of scheduling, as the latter 
does not only allow us to think during times 
in between about the materials we have, bur 
also about where to go next. It could just be 
rather impractical to move hurriedly directly 
from one field site to the next, according to a 

REFLECTIONS ON MULTI-SITE ETHNOGRAPHY 367 
plan allowing for little alteration along the 
way. 
Concludin g one of his contributions to a 
recent British volume on anthropological field­
work -Oxford-based, and thus also in a way 
updating the classic Evans-Pritchard model -
detailing his own enduring East African com­
mitment, David Parkin (2000: 1 07) notes that 
practical circumsta nces such as the growing 
number of anthropo logists, and governmental 
financial restrictions on purely academic 
research, are factors which probably matter more to changes in styles of doing research 
than does intellectual debate; and he suggests 
that if more ethnographers now actually 
spread their fieldwork over many shorter 
periods than do it in the classic way of larger 
blocks of time, that is one such change. That 
sounds very likely, for again, ethnography is an 
art of the possible. Yet this is not to say that 
intellectual argument over changes and varia­
tions in the conduct of ethnography is useless. 
Perhaps these notes on experiences of multi­
site fieldwork can contribute to such debate.
