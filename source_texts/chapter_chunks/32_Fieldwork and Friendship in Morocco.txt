Fieldwork and Friendship 
in Morocco 
P au/ Rabinow 
8 Friendship 
Driss ben Mohammed, a jovial, portly, and 
even-tempered young man, had consistently 
refused to work as an informant. Over the 
course of my stay we had come to know each 
other casually, as time permitted, almost acci­
dentally. Gradual ly, a certain trust had flow­
ered between us. At its root, 1 think, was an 
awareness of our differences and a mutual 
respect. 
Ben Mohammed was not afraid of me (as 
many other villagers were), nor did he have 
hesitations about associating with Europeans 
(although he had had almost no personal 
contact with them), nor did he seek to profit 
from my presence (he refused most gifts). 
Simply, he was my host and treated me with 
the respect which is supposed to be reserved 
for a guest, even one who stayed as long as I 
did. 
To be friends, according to Aristotle, two 
people "must be mutually recognized as 
bearing goodwill and wishing well to each 
other ... either because of utility, pleasure, or 
good ..... That type of friendship stemming 
from the good is best because ... that which is 
good without qualification is also pleasant, but 
such friendships require time and familiarity 
... a wish for friendship may arise quickly but 
friendship does not." 1 As time wore on and my friendship with ben 
Mohammed deepened, I was learning more 
and more from him. During the last months of 
fieldwork, when he was home from school and 
we could spend many of the hot hours 
together, the field experience, now nearing its 
completion, reached a new emotional and 
intellectual depth. Casually, without plan or 
schedule, just walkin g around the fields, ripe 
with grain or muddy from the irrigation water 
in the truck gardens, we had a meandering 
series of conversations. Ben Mohammed's 
initial refusal of informant status set up the 
possibility of another type of communication. 
But clearly our communication would not 
have been possible without those more regu­
larized and disciplined relationships I had had 
with others. Partly in reaction to the profes­
sional situation, we had slipped into a more 
unguarded and relaxed course over the 
months. 
Although we talked of many things, perhaps 
the most significant set of discussions turned 
on our relations to our separate traditions. It 
would have been almost impossible to have 
had such conversations with either AJi or 
Malik, enmeshed as they were in the web of 
their own local world. Nor, for that matter, 
would it have been possible with many of the 
Frenchified Moroccan intellectuals; half torn 
out of their own ill-understood traditions, and

afflicted with a heightened and unhappy self­
consciousness, they would be unable to bridge 
the gap either way. Ben Mohammed, in his 
own modest way, was also an intellectual, but 
he was one of those who still looked to Fez 
rather than Paris for his inspiration. This pro­
vided a crucial space between us. 
The fundamental tenet of Islam, for ben 
Mohammed, was that all believers are equal 
before Allah, even though pride, egoism, and 
ignorance obscure this fact. Very, very, few 
people, in his view, actually believe in Islam. 
Most take only a "narrow" view: they think 
that if they merely follow the basic prescrip­
tions then they are Muslims. Ben Mohammed 
emphatically disagreed. If belief in the equal­
ity among believers and in submission to Allah 
is not in your heart, and does not inform your 
actions, then prayer or even the pilgrimage to 
Mecca counts for nothing. Niya, or intention, 
is the key. You might be able to fool your 
neighbors by shallow adherence to externals; 
but you would not fool Allah. Today, for ben 
Mohammed, the true Muslim is mistrusted in 
the Islamic world. People interpret generosity 
and submission as weakness or foolishness. 
Boasting, hypocrisy, quarreling, and fighting 
prevail because people do not truly understand 
and accept the wisdom of Islam. 
He brought up the example of Sidi Lahcen. 
Most of the saint's descendants knew little if 
anything about his teachings or his "path." 
They are ignorant. Yet they feel superior to 
other Muslims because they are descended from 
a famous saint and can lay claim to his baraka, 
to his holiness. But if they would read the books 
which their patron saint wrote, they would see 
that Sidi Lahcen himself fought against such 
vanity. He had preached submission to Allah 
alone. The only true nobles in Islam were those 
who lived exemplary lives and followed Allah. 
Sidi Lahcen 's descendants, however, by relying 
on his spiritual strength, had lost their own. 
They think that their genealogical connections 
alone should command respect; Sidi Lahcen 
would have disagreed. 
Ben Mohammed was striving, he said, to 
follow the path of Sidi Lahcen. But it posed 
specific problems for him. His father, whom he 
respected, vehemently opposed his "reformist" 
interpretations. This would not change ben 
Mohammed's personal beliefs, but it was his duty to respect those of his father. Ben 
Mohammed knew that his father, an old man 
set in his ways, was not about to alter his 
views. Actually , Sidi Lahcen himself had taken 
a parallel stance in his own age: popular reli­
gion was to be combatted in its excesses but 
tolerated for its piety. 
For ben Mohammed the tensions of his 
world view turned on these two Moroccan 
alternatives. Morocco' s future was far from 
bright. He would have great difficulty in 
finding the kind of work and life he desired. 
His expectations were geared to those of his 
country. But he also knew that the symbols 
and guides for the future would have to be 
drawn from Morocco' s tradition. Moroccans 
could not ignore the West. This attitude 
required borrowing, integrating, and eliminat­
ing certain archaic and oppressive practices, 
but it did not mean merely imitating the West; 
and most important of all, it did not require 
the abandonment of Islam. 
With most informants, I would have 
stopped at this point of generality. But with 
ben Mohammed I felt I could proceed further. 
Throughout my stay in Morocco I had noticed 
that black was negatively valued in a variety 
of ways. In the broadest terms, white was gen­
erally equated with good and black with evil. 
Malik in particular seemed consistently con­
cerned about color distinctions and their sym­
bolism. Black was bad, according to his view, 
a color worthy of a dog. The lighter you are 
the better you are, the more you shone in the 
eyes of Allah. Malik was joking one day about 
a very poor villager. He said the man was so 
poor he would have to marry a black. Malik's 
new-born daughter, he pointed out innum er­
able times, was very white. When I showed 
him pictures of America he always made a 
point of saying that he could not tell if the 
blacks were men or women. He had been very 
upset when he found out that one of his 
favorite songs on the radio was by a black 
group. After that, he was careful to find out 
the color of a singer before offering any opin­
ions on the music. Malik was not at all timid 
about discussing this symbolism. He was quite 
sure of himself; his source of ultimate author­
ity was the Koran. 
Throughout my stay I had been the dutiful 
anthropo logist and noted down his comments, 

FIELDWORK AND FRIENDSHIP IN MOROCCO 449 
refraining from publicly reacting. But toward 
the end I let myself be affected by them more, 
and they really began to rankle. I am light in 
complexion with blue eyes and light brown 
hair. I was tempted many times to ask Malik, 
who has a dark skin tone, kinky hair, and large 
lips, if he thought this made me superior to 
him, but I never did. There was no point in 
confronting him. 
Ben Mohammed was a different story. When 
I finally approached him about my feelings on 
the matter, he was quite lucid. We were sitting 
on a hillside, under some fig trees, overlook­
ing the Brueghelesque field below, amiably 
passing a hot, cloudless summer afternoon. I 
cautiously began to unburden myself about 
Malik. Again ben Mohammed straddled the 
cultural divide rather artfully. He fully agreed 
that the downgrading of blacks was a bad 
thing. It was incumbent on Muslims to fight 
racism in all its forms. There was no ambigu­
ity on that point. But, such symbolism was 
indeed in the Koran. Most people rely on 
custom and not on their own intel ligence. 
Malik was a peasant and could not be 
expected to know any better. He had been 
raised with these aphorisms, and lived with 
them, and he was not going to easily rid 
himself of such a bias. 
He cautioned me, however , not to confuse 
Malik's views with the kind of racism he knew 
existed in America or Europe. Although Malik 
expressed anti-black sentiments, no Moroccan 
would ever keep someone out of a hotel or a 
job because of his skin color. Cultures were 
different, ben Mohammed was saying. Even 
when they say the same thing, an expression 
can mean something entirely different when it 
is played out in society. Be careful about your 
judgments. I agreed. 
Yet, there was one further question to ask: 
Are we all equal, ben Mohammed? Or are 
Muslims superior? He became flustered. Here 
there was no possibility of reformist interpre­
tation or compromise. The answer was no, we 
are not equal. All Muslims, even the most 
unworthy and reprehensible, and we named a 
few we both knew, are superior to all non­
Muslims. That was Allah's will. The division 
of the world into Muslim and non-Muslim 
was the fundamental cultural distinction, the 
Archimedean point from which all else turned. This was ultimately what separated us. But, 
as Aristotle points out, "in a friendship based 
on virtue, complaints do not arise, but the 
purpose of the doer is a sort of measure; for in 
purpose lies the essential element of virtue and 
character ... friendship asks a man to do what 
he can, not what is proportional to the merits 
of the case, since that can not always be 
d ,2 one .... 
The lessons of tolerance and self-acceptance 
which ben Mohammed had been teaching me 
during the past months held sway. I had a 
strong sense of being American. I knew it was 
time to leave Morocco. 
The "revolution" had occurred during my 
absence (1968-9). My friends from Chicago, 
many of them now living in New York, were 
fervently and unabashedly "political" when I 
returned. New York, where I had grown up, 
looked the same as when I had left it. But the, 
city and my friends were now more impene­
trable to me than ben Mohammed. The whole 
revery of future conummitas which had 
sustained me through months of lonel iness 
refused to actualize itself upon my return. I 
adopted a stance of passivity waiting for it to 
appear. Perhaps the most bizarre dimension of 
my return was the fact that my friends were 
now seemingly preoccupied with the Third 
World; at least the phrase had an obligatory 
place in their discourse. I had just been in the 
Third World with a vengeance. Yet this Third 
World which they so avidly portrayed bore no 
obvious relation to my experiences. Initially 
when I pointed this out, I was politely ignored. 
When I persisted it was suggested that I was 
perhaps a bit reactiona ry. The maze of slightly 
blurred nuance, that feeling of barely grasped 
meanings which had been my constant com­
panion in Morocco overtook me once again. 
But now I was home. 
Over the next several years other activities 
absorbed me, writing and teaching among 
them. Writing this book seems to have enabled 
me to go on to another type of fieldwork, to 
begin again on a different terrain. 
Trinh Van Du entered the room carrying a 
dozen roses for our hostess. He was perhaps 
five feet tall and drew attention to this imme­
diately by announcing that although he was 
thirty-three, Americans often mistook him for 

450 PAUL RABINOW 
fifteen. The first hour or so of introductory 
chat was a bit stilted� but Du managed to 
include six or seven references to Ho Chi Minh 
along with the fact that he had been in the 
United States almost twelve years, doing odd 
jobs and teaching, for a time, at the Monterey 
Army language school. Things warmed up 
enormously when we switched from politics 
and credentials to language and culture. Yes, 
he would love to teach us Vietnamese and 
introduce us to Vietnamese literature, particu­
larly poetry. The Hue dialect, his own, is the 
most poetic (as are its women), the Saigon 
dialect the most sing-song like Chinese, and 
the Hanoi the most precise and clear . But all 
Vietnamese read the same language and all 
love the Tale of Kieu. He would recite it for us 
in all three dialects and we would choose the 
one we liked best. Leaping up, filled with 
sparkle, yet almost solemn, he recited the first 
�· verses of the famous nineteenth-century poem, 
three times. 
Conclusion 
Culture is interpretation. The 'facts' of anthro­
pology, the material which the anthropologist 
has gone to the field to find, are already them­
selves interpreta tions. The baseline data is 
already culturally mediated by the people 
whose culture we, as anthropolo gists, have 
come to explore. Facts are made -the word 
comes from the Latin factum, "made" -and 
the facts we interpret are made and remade. 
Therefore they cannot be collected as if they 
were rocks, picked up and put into cartons and 
shipped home to be analyzed in the laboratory. 
Culture in all of its manifestations is overde­
termined. It does not present itself neutrally or 
with one voice. Every cultural fact can be 
interpreted in many ways, both by the anthro­
pologist and by his subjects. The scientific 
revolutions which established these parameters 
at the turn of the current century have been 
largely ignored in anthropol ogy. Frederic 
Jameson's reference to the paradigm shift in 
linguistics applies to anthropology as well. He 
notes "a movement from a substantive way of 
thinking to a relational one .... Difficulties 
arose from terms which tried to name sub­
stances or objects ... while linguistics was a science characterized by the absence of such 
substances .... There are first of all points of 
view ... with whose help you then subse­
quently create your objects. "3 
The fact that all cultural facts are interpre­
tations, and multivocal ones at that, is true 
both for the anthropologist and for his infor­
mant, the Other with whom he works. His 
informant -and the word is accurate -must 
interpret his own culture and that of the 
anthropologist. The same holds for the anthro­
pologist. Both live in rich, partially integrated , 
ongoing life worlds. They are, however, not the 
same. Nor is there any mechanical and easy 
means of translation from one set of experi­
ences to the other. That problem and the 
process of translation, therefore, become one 
of the central arts and crucial tasks of field­
work. It should be clear that the view of the 
"primitive" as a creature living by rigid rules, 
in total harmony with his environment, and 
essentially not cursed with a glimmer of self­
consciousness, is a set of complex cultural pro­
jections. There is no "primitive." There are 
other men, living other lives. 
Anthropology is an interpretive science. Its 
object of study, humanity encountered as 
Other, is on the same epistemological level as 
it is. Both the anthropologist and his infor­
mants live in a culturally mediated world, 
caught up in "webs of signification'' they 
themselves have spun. This is the ground of 
anthropo logy; there is no privileged position, 
no absolute perspective, and no valid way to 
eliminate consciousness from our activities or 
those of others. This central fact can be 
avoided by pretending it does not exist. Both 
sides can be frozen. We can pretend that we 
are neutral scientists collecting unambiguous 
data and that the people we are studying are 
living amid various unconscious systems of 
determining forces of which they have no clue 
and to which only we have the key. But it is 
only pretense. 
Anthropological facts are cross-cult ural, 
because they are made across cultural bound­
aries. They exist as lived experience, but they 
are made into facts during the process of ques­
tioning, observing, and experiencing -which 
both the anthropologist and the people with 
whom he lives engage in. This means that the 
informant must first learn to explicate his own 

FIELDWORK AND FRIENDSHIP IN MOROCCO 451 
culture, to become self-conscious about it and 
begin to objectify his own life-world. He must 
then learn to "present" it to the anthropolo­
gist, to an outsider who by definition does not 
understand even the most obvious things. This 
presentation by the informant is defined, there­
fore, by being in a mode of externalit y. The 
informant is asked in innumerable ways to 
think about particular aspects of his own 
world, and he must then learn to construct 
ways to present this newly focused-on object 
to someone who is outside his culture, who 
shares few of his assumptions, and whose 
purpose and procedures are opaque. Thus 
when a Moroccan describes his lineage struc­
ture to an anthropologist, he must do several 
things. He must first become self-reflective and 
self-conscious about certain aspects of his life 
which he had previously taken largely for 
granted. Once he arrives at some understand­
ing of what the anthropologist is driving at, 
thinks about that subject matter, and comes to 
a conclusion (all of which can occur in a 
matter of seconds, of course, and is not in itself 
a theoretical process), the informant must then 
figure out how to present this information to 
the anthropolo gist, an outsider who is by def­
inition external to his usual life-world. 
This creates the beginnings of a hybrid, 
cross-cultural object or product. During the 
period of fieldwork a system of shared sym­
bols must be developed if this process of object 
formation -through self-reflection, self-objec­
tification, presentation, and further explication 
-is to continue. Particularly in its early stages 
when there is little common experience, under­
standing, or language to fall back on, this is a 
very difficult and trying process; the ground is 
just not there. Things become more secure as 
this liminal world is mutually constructed but, 
by definition, it never really loses its quality of 
externality. This externali ty, however, is a 
moving ratio. It is external both for the anthro­
pologist (it is not his own lifeworld) and for 
the informants, who gradually learn to inform. 
The present somewhat nasty connotations of 
the word do apply at times, but so does its 
older root sense "to give form to, to be the for­
mative principle of, to animate.'' What is given 
form is this communication. The informant 
gives external form to his own experiences, by 
presenting them to meet the anthropolo gist's questions, to the extent that he can interpret 
them. 
This informing, however , goes on not in a 
laboratory but in interpersonal interaction. It 
is intersubjective, between subjects. At best, it 
is panial and thin. The depth and scope of the 
culture that has been constructed is often 
woefully inadequate when measured against 
people interacting and carrying on their daily 
rounds in the everyday world. Anthropolo gy 
is not a set of questionnair es which are handed 
over, filled out, and handed back. Most of the 
anthropologist's time is spent sitting around 
waiting for informants, doing errands, drink­
ing tea, taking genealogies, mediating fights, 
being pestered for rides, and vainly attempting 
small talk -all in someone else's culture. The 
inadequacy of one's comprehension ts mces­
santly brought to the surface and publicly 
displayed. 
Interruptions and eruptions mock the field­
worker and his inquiry; more accurately , they 
may be said to inform his inquiry, to be an 
essential part of it. The constant breakdown, 
it seems to me, is not just an annoying acci­
dent but a core aspect of this type of inquiry. 
Later I became increasingly aware that these 
ruptures of communication were highly reveal­
ing, and often proved to be turning points. At 
the time, however, they seemed only to repre­
sent our frustration. Etymology comes to the 
rescue again: e-ruption, a breaking out, and 
inter-ruption, a breaking in, of this liminal 
culture through which we were trying to 
commumcate. 
Whenever these breaks occurred -and I 
have described several of the most important 
ones earlier-the cycle began again. This cross­
cultural communication and interaction all 
took on a new content, often a new depth. The 
groundwork we had laid often seemed to fall 
away from under us and we scrambled some­
where else. More had been incorporated, more 
could be taken for granted, more could be 
shared. This is a moving ratio and one which 
never reaches identity, far from it. But there is 
movement, there is change, there is informing. 
Fieldwork, then, is a process of intersubjec­
tive construction of liminal modes of commu­
nication. Intersubjective means literally more 
than one subject, but being situated neither 
quite here nor quite there, the subjects 

452 PAUL RABINOW 
involved do not share a common set of 
assumptions, experiences, or traditions. Their 
construction is a public process. Most of this 
book has focused on these objects which my 
Moroccan friends and I constructed between 
us, over time, in order to commu nicate. That 
the communication was often painstaking and 
partial is a central theme. That it was not 
totally opaque is an equally important theme. 
It is the dialectic between these poles, ever 
repeated, never quite the same, which consti­
tutes fieldwork. 
Summing up, then, we can say the following. 
The first person with whom I had any sus­
tained contact was the Frenchman Maurice 
Richard. Staying at his hotel was an obligatory 
first step for Europeans entering into Sefrou 
(although recently the Moroccan government 
has opened a luxury hotel). Knowing that his 
clientele will not be with him long, Richard has 
developed a persona of cheerful good wiJl, 
which becomes less and less convincing as he 
becomes more isolated. The contact with 
Richard was immediate. There was no lan­
guage barrier. He was eager to talk. Being an 
outsider to all of the other Sefrou groups, he 
had interesting stereotypes of each, which he 
was more than willing to exchange for a recep­
tive smile. His very accessibility, however, was 
also revealing of his limitations. He provided 
entry only to the past, to the last days of colo­
nialism. He was located on the very edge of 
Sefrou society, its most external point. His 
corner was easily accessible, but it revealed 
only the fringes of Moroccan society. Although 
this subject provided ample material for an 
inquiry, and was in fact in the process of dis­
appearing forever, my project led me in other 
directions. 
Ibrahim was on the other side of the buffer 
zone between the French and the Moroccan 
societies. He had matured during the waning 
days of the Protectorate and made his career 
by artfully straddling the line between com­
munities without any confusion as to which 
side of the ljne he was on. His speciality was 
presenting goods and services for external con­
sumption. They were carefully packaged. He 
was a guide along the main thoroughf ares of 
Sefrou society. His tour was quite helpful for 
understanding the Ville Nouvelle, but his aid stopped at the waJls of the medina. Despite his 
caution, the first breakthroughs of Otherness 
occurred with Ibrahim. This professional of 
the external was, nonethel ess, a Moroccan. 
My guide through the medina of Sefrou and 
the transitional zones of Moroccan culture was 
AJi. My contact with him was the first major 
step toward a more intimate relationship with 
Sefrou. He was a floating figure within his own 
society, living a hand-to-mouth existence in the 
city. He was a patient, curious, highly imagi­
native, adventurous, sensuous, and relentlessly 
perceptive person. My orientation to Moroc­
can culture as immediacy, as lived experience, 
came from my friendship with Ali. He had 
rejected a certain way of life, but not other 
Moroccan alternatives. He was acerbic and 
direct in his criticisms of village ways, but they 
were insider's jibes. 
Ali was also limited by his strengths. 
Because of his demeanor and antagonism he 
had almost become an outcast in the village. 
The insights and orientations which he con­
tinued to provide for me throughout the field 
experience were invaluable. He knowingly and 
adroitly used the vilJagers' inhibitions and vul­
nerabilities against them. AJi was an insider's 
outsider� His unique vantage point and 
provocative attitude periodically rescued me 
from impasses and colJective resistance. Ali 
was, however, now outside village affairs, basi­
cally out of touch. He provided little help on 
the day-to-day level, but could be relied on for 
vital aid. 
So, just as Richard was situated between 
the two French commun ities, and Ibrahim 
between the French and local Moroccan Ville 
NouveJle groups, so Ali was situated between 
the floating population of the medina and his 
natal village of saint's descendants. AJI were 
marginal, all provided help in making transi­
tions from group to group, site to site. 
Within Sidi Lahcen itself, the situation 
became more tightly controlled. The commu­
nity tacitly (and in some cases explicitly) 
attempted to situate the anthropologist and 
thereby control him. The first two young men 
with whom I worked exemplif y this. Mekki, 
my first informant, literally pushed on me by 
the villagers, was from Ali's sub-lineage. Not 
being burdened with family or work obliga­
tions, he eagerly sought what to others was a 

FIELDWORK AND FRIENDSHIP IN MOROCCO 453 
mixed blessing. Unfortunately, he lacked both 
intelligence and the imaginative ability to 
objectify his own life-world and then present 
it to a foreigner. This was an insurmountable 
handicap. Rashid, my second informant, 
was everything that Mekki was not; that was 
his problem. He was imaginative, energetic, 
curious, intelligent, and was floating, like Ali, 
except that Rashid's experience was essentially 
limited to village life. He could have been and 
was (from time to time) an extremely im­
portant informant. But, again like Ali, he 
aroused strong community disapproval. 
Rashid's tongue was feared. Everyone, includ­
ing his father, sought to silence him. Unsure 
about my presence in the village, they wanted 
some control over the information I was 
receiving. Rashid knew a great deal and was 
eager to convey it. As the Moroccan proverb 
goes, Those who have no shame, do as they 
please. And so those with no internal sense of 
appropriate behavior must be controlled by 
force. Rashid, unlike Ali, had no power base, 
no alternative cards to play. In general, he was 
forced to accede to the communit y's injunc­
tions, yet he enjoyed violating them whenever 
the opportunity presented itself. 
Malik offered an excellent compromise, 
both for me and for the commun ity. I had 
forced my way into Sidi Lahcen, after all, and 
the villagers feared that ultimately I had come 
to subvert their religion. Therefore, it was 
appropriate that the man who became my 
central informant was situated on the edge of 
the most respected of the saintly sub-lineages. 
This group had a very high rate of endoga­
mous marriage. Malik's father, however, had 
married a woman not only from outside the 
sub-lineage but from outside the village. 
Consequently , as closely attached to this core 
group as he was emotional ly, he was struc­
turally somewhat on its edge, and he over­
compensated for it. 
He was the perfect representative of ortho­
doxy. He was proud of his tradition but he had 
failed to find a traditional role for himself. 
Impatient with the position of fqi, he was 
stymied in pursuing his own grandiose self­
image. A conservative, he lacked institutions to 
defend. He proved to be the perfect commu­
nity choice. The elders of his sub-lineage sanc­
tioned his involvement and so did Sergeant Larawi, the most powerful man in the village. 
They knew they could trust Malik. 
Malik, like Ibrahim, was self-contr olled, 
orderly, and reserved. But unlike Ibrahim, he 
had not made a career of external relations. 
Malik had remained within the rural world. 
Malik would have liked to be the internal 
counterpart of Ibrahim. But no such role 
existed. He had to improvise as he went along. 
His "impression management," however, was 
in constant tension with the inputs of Ali, 
Rashid, and others. Malik attempted to steer 
cautiously around sensitive areas. Once chal­
lenged, he would yield, but after the early 
going, he would rarely initiate. As we pro­
ceeded, Malik became more dependent on me 
than I was on him. This helps explain his lack 
of sustained resistance on sensitive areas; 
Ibrahim, no doubt, would not have backed 
down so readily. 
Many of the political dimensions of the 
informant relationship were obviated by Driss 
ben Mohammed's steadfast adherence to the 
role of host. This eventually established the 
grounds for a dialogue. Ben Mohammed was 
internal to the Moroccan tradition. He looked 
back to his forefather, the seventeenth-century 
saint, for guidance in the modern world. He 
maintained a belief in the ultimate and uncon­
ditional superiority of Islam. 
This absolute difference which separated us 
was openly acknowle dged only at the end of 
my stay. We had become friends, we had 
shown each other mutual respect and trust. 
The limits of the situation were not obscured 
for either of us. I was for him a rich member 
of a dominant civilization about which he had 
the profoundest reservations. To me, he was 
struggling to revive a cultural universe which 
I no longer inhabited and could not ultimately 
support. But our friendship tempered our dif­
ferences. Here we had come full circle. There 
were now two subjects facing each other. Each 
was the product of an historical tradition 
which situated and conditioned him. Each was 
aware of a profound crisis within that tradi­
tion but still looked back to it for renewal and 
solace. We were profoundly Other to each 
other. 
That I would journey to Morocco to con­
front Otherness and myself was typical of my 
culture (or the parts of it I could accept). That

ben Mohammed would enter into this sort of 
dialogue without self-denigration was impres­
sive. My restless and scientifically cloaked 
wanderings brought me to this mountain 
village in Morocco. Ben Mohammed sought 
the wisdom of the reformist saint, yet was 
willing, even eager , to tell me about him. 
Through mutual confrontation of our own sit­
uations we did establish contact. But this also 
highlighted our fundamental Otherness. What 
separated us was fundamentally our past. I 
could understand ben Mohammed only to the 
extent that he could understand me -that is 
to say, partialJy. He did not live in a crystalline world of immutable Otherness any more than 
I did. He grew up in an historical situation 
which provided him with meaningful but only 
partially satisfactory interpretations of his 
world, as did I. Our Otherness was not an 
ineffable essence, but rather the sum of differ­
ent historical experiences. Different webs of 
signification separated us, but these webs were 
now at least partially intertwined. But a dia­
logue was only possible when we recognize d 
our differences, when we remained critically 
loyal to the symbols which our traditions had 
given us. By so doing, we began a process of 
change.
