The Methods of Ethnology 
Franz Boas 
During the last ten years the methods of 
inquiry into the historical development of civ­
ilization have undergone remarkable changes. 
During the second half of the last century evo­
lutionary thought held almost complete sway 
and investigators like Spencer, Morgan, Tylor, 
Lubbock, to mention only a few, were under 
the spell of the idea of a general, uniform evo­
lution of culture in which all parts of mankind 
participated. The newer development goes 
back in part to the influence of Ratzel whose 
geographical training impressed him with the 
importance of diffusion and migration. The 
problem of diffusion was taken up in detail 
particularly in America� but was applied in a 
much wider sense by Foy and Graebner, and 
finally seized upon in a still wider application 
by EUiot Smith and Rivers, so that at the 
present time, at least among certain groups of 
investigators in England and also jn Germany, 
ethnological research is based on the concept 
of migration and dissemination rather than 
upon that of evolution. 
A critical study of these two directions of 
inquiry shows that each is founded on the 
application of one fundamental hypothesis. 
The evolutionary point of view presupposes 
that the course of historical changes in the cul­
tural life of mankind follows definite laws 
which are applicable everywhere, and which 
bring it about that cultural development is, in 
its main Jines, the same among all races and all peoples. This idea is clearly expressed by Tylor 
in the introductory pages of his classic work 
"Primitive Culture." As soon as we admit that 
the hypothesis of a uniform evolution has to 
be proved before it can be accepted, the whole 
structure loses its foundation. It is true that 
there are indications of parallelism of devel­
opment in different parts of the world, and 
that similar customs are found in the most 
diverse and widely separated parts of the 
globe. The occurrence of these similarities 
which are distributed so irregularly that they 
cannot readily be explained on the basis of dif­
fusion, is one of the foundations of the evolu­
tionary hypothesis, as it was the foundation of 
Bastian's psychologizing treatment of cultural 
phenomena. On the other hand, it may be 
recognized that the hypothesis implies the 
thought that our modern Western European 
civilization represents the highest cultural 
development towards which all other more 
primitive cultural types tend, and that, there­
fore, retrospectively, we construct an ortho­
genetic development towards our own modern 
civilization. It is clear that if we admit that 
there may be different ultimate and coexisting 
types of civilization, the hypothesis of one 
single general line of development cannot be 
maintained. 
Opposed to these assumptions is the modem 
tendency to deny the existence of a general 
evolutionary scheme which would represent 
Franz Boas, "The Methods of Ethnology," pp. 311-21 from American Anthropologist 22:4 (Oct.-Dec., 1920). 

THE METHODS OF ETHNOL OGY 41 
the history of the cultural development the 
world over. The hypothesis that there are inner 
causes which bring about similarities of devel­
opment in remote parts of the globe is rejected 
and in its place it is assumed that identity of 
development in two different parts of the globe 
must always be due to migration and diffusion. 
On this basis historical contact is demanded 
for enormously large areas. The theory 
demands a high degree of stability of cultural 
traits such as is apparently observed in many 
primitive tribes, and it is furthermore based on 
the supposed correlation between a number of 
diverse and mutually independent cultural 
traits which reappear in the same combina­
tions in distant parts of the world. In this 
sense, modern investigation takes up anew 
Gerland's theory of the persistence of a 
number of cultural traits which were devel­
oped in one center and carried by man in his 
migrations from continent to continent. 
It seems to me that if the hypothetical foun­
dations of these two extreme forms of ethno­
logical research are broadly stated as I have 
tried to do here, it is at once clear that the cor­
rectness of the assumptions has nor been 
demonstrated, but that arbitrarily the one or 
the other has been selected for the purpose of 
obtaining a consistent picture of cultural devel­
opment. These methods are essentially forms 
of classification of the static phenomena of 
culture according to two distinct principles, 
and interpretations of these classifications as of 
historical significance, without, however , any 
attempt to prove that this interpretation is jus­
tifiable. To give an example: It is observed that 
in most parts of the world there are resem­
blances between decorative forms that are rep­
resentative and others that are more or less 
geometrical. According to the evolutionary 
point of view, their development is explained 
in the following manner: the decorative forms 
are arranged in such order that the most rep­
resentative forms are placed at the beginning. 
The other forms are so placed that they show 
a gradual transition from representative forms 
to purely conventional geometric forms, and 
this order is then interpreted as meaning that 
geometric designs originated from representa­
tive designs which gradually degenerated. This 
method has been pursued, for instance, by 
Putnam, Stolpe, Balfour, and Haddon, and by Verworn and, in his earlier writings, by von 
den Steinen. While I do not mean to deny that 
this development may have occurred, it would 
be rash to generalize and to claim that in every 
case the classification which has been made 
according to a definite principle represents an 
historical development. The order might as 
well be reversed and we might begin with a 
simple geometric element which, by the addi­
tion of new traits, might be developed into a 
representative design, and we might claim that 
this order represents an historical sequence. 
Both of these possibilities were considered by 
Holmes as early as 1885. Neither the one nor 
the other theory can be established without 
actual historical proof. 
The opposite attitude, namely, ortgm 
through diffusion, is exhibited in Heinrich 
Schurtz's attempt to connect the decorative art 
of Northwest America with that of Melanesia. 
The simple fact that in these areas elements 
occur that may be interpreted as eyes, induced 
him to assume that both have a common 
origin, without allowing for the possibility 
that the pattern in the two areas -each of 
which shows highly distinctive characteristics 
-may have developed from independent 
sources. In this attempt Schurtz followed 
Ratzel who had already tried to establish con­
nections between Melanesia and Northwest 
America on the basis of other cultural features. 
While ethnographical research based on 
these two fundamental hypotheses seems to 
characterize the general tendency of European 
thought, a different method is at present 
pursued by the majority of American anthro­
pologists. The difference between the two 
directions of study may perhaps best be sum­
marized by the statement that American schol­
ars are primarily interested in the dynamic 
phenomena of cultural change, and try to elu­
cidate cultural history by the application of the 
results of their studies; and that they relegate 
the solution of the ultimate question of the 
relative importance of parallelism of cultural 
development in distant areas, as against world­
wide diffusion, and stability of cultural traits 
over long periods to a future time when the 
actual conditions of cultural change are better 
known. The American ethnological methods 
are analogous to those of European, particu­
larly of Scandinavian, archaeology, and of the 

42 FRANZ BOAS 
researches into the prehistoric period of the 
eastern Mediterranean area. 
It may seem to the distant observer that 
American students are engaged in a mass of 
detailed investigations without much bearing 
upon the solution of the ultimate problems of 
a philosophic history of human civilization. I 
think this interpreta tion of the American atti­
tude wo�d be unjust because the ultimate 
questions are as near to our hearts as they are 
to those of other scholars, only we do not hope 
to be able to solve an intricate historical 
problem by a formula. 
First of all, the whole problem of cultural 
history appears to us as a historical problem. 
In order to understand history it is necessary 
to know not only how things are, but how they 
have come to be. In the domain of ethnology , 
where, for most parts of the world, no histor­
ical facts are available except those that may 
be revealed by archaeological study, all evi-. 
dence of change can be inferred only by indi­
rect methods. Their character is represented in 
the researches of students of comparative 
philology. The method is based on the com­
parison of static phenomena combined with 
the study of their distribution . What can be 
done by this method is well illustrated by Dr 
Lowie's investigations of the military societies 
of the Plains Indians, or by the modern inves­
tigation of American mythology. It is, of 
course, true that we can never hope to obtain 
incontrovertible data relating to the chrono­
logical sequence of events, but certain general 
broad outlines can be ascertained with a high 
degree of probabili ty, even of certainty. 
As soon as these methods are applied, prim­
itive society loses the appearance of absolute 
stability which is conveyed to the student who 
sees a certain people only at a certain given 
time. All cultural forms rather appear in a con­
stant state of flux and subject to fundamental 
modifications. 
It is intelligible why in our studies the 
problem of dissemination should take a promi­
nent position. It is much easier to prove dis­
semination than to follow up developments 
due to inner forces, and the data for such a 
study are obtained with much greater diffi­
culty. They may, however, be observed in every 
phenomenon of acculturation in which foreign 
elements are remodeled according to the pat-terns prevalent in their new environment, and 
they may be found in the peculiar local devel­
opments of widely spread ideas and activities. 
The reason why the study of inner develop­
ment has not been taken up energetically, is 
not due to the fact that from a theoretical point 
of view it is unimportant, it is rather due to 
the inherent methodological difficulties. It may 
perhaps be recognized that in recent years 
attention is being drawn to this problem, as 
is manifested by the investigations on the 
processes of acculturation and of the inter­
dependence of cultural activities which are 
attracting the attention of many investigators. 
The further pursuit of these inquiries 
emphasizes the importance of a feature which 
is common to all historic phenomena. While in 
natural sciences we are accustomed to consider 
a given number of causes and to study their 
effects, in historical happenings we are com­
pelled to consider every phenomenon not only 
as effect but also as cause. This is true even in 
the particular application of the laws of phys­
ical nature, as, for instance, in the study of 
astronomy in which the position of certain 
heavenly bodies at a given moment may be 
considered as the effect of gravitation, while, 
at the same time, their particular arrangement 
in space determines future changes. This rela­
tion appears much more clearly in the history 
of human civilization. To give an example: a 
surplus of food supply is liable �o bring about 
an increase of population and an increase of 
leisure, which gives opportunity for occupa­
tions that are not absolutely necessary for the 
needs of every day life. In turn the increase of 
population and of leisure, which may be 
applied to new inventions, give rise to a greater 
food supply and to a further increase in the 
amount of leisure, so that a cumulative effect 
results. 
Similar considerations may be made in 
regard to the important problem of the rela­
tion of the individual to society, a problem that 
has to be considered whenever we study the 
dynamic conditions of change. The activities of 
the individual are determined to a great extent 
by his social environment, but in turn his own 
a<:!ivities influence the society in which he 
lives, and may bring about modifications in its 
form. Obviously, this problem is one of the 
most important ones to be taken up in a study 

-THE METHODS OF ETHNOLOGY 43 
of cultural changes. It is also beginning to 
attract the attention of students who are no 
longer satisfied with the systematic enumera­
tion of standardized beliefs and customs of a 
tribe, but who begin to be interested in the 
question of the way in which the individual 
reacts to his whole social environment, and to 
the differences of opinion and of mode of 
action that occur in primitive society and 
which are the causes of far-reaching changes. 
In short then, the method which we try to 
develop is based on a study of the dynamic 
changes in society that may be observed at the 
present time. We refrain from the attempt to 
solve the fundamental problem of the general 
development of civilization until we have been 
able to unravel the processes that are going on 
under our eyes. 
Certain general conclusions may be drawn 
from this study even now. First of all, the 
history of human civilization does not appear 
to us as determined entirely by psychological 
necessity that leads to a uniform evolution the 
world over. We rather see that each cultural 
group has its own unique history, dependent 
partly upon the peculiar inner development of 
the social group, and partly upon the foreign 
influences to which it has been subjected. 
There have been processes of gradual differen­
tiation as well as processes of leveling down 
differences between neighboring cultural 
centers, but it would be quite impossible to 
understand, on the basis of a single evolution­
ary scheme, what happened to any particular 
people. An example of the contrast between 
the two points of view is clearly indicated by 
a comparison of the treatment of Zuni civi­
lization by Frank Hamilton Cushing on the 
one hand, on the other by modern students, 
particularly by Elsie Clews Parsons, A. L. 
Kroeber and Leslie Spier. Cushing believed that 
it was possible to explain Zuni culture entirely 
on the basis of the reaction of the Zuni mind 
to its geographical environment, and that the 
whole of Zuni culture could be explained as 
the development which followed necessarily 
from the position in which the people were 
placed. Cushing's keen insight into the Indian 
mind and his thorough knowledge of the most 
intimate life of the people gave great plausi­
bility to his interpretations. On the other hand, 
Dr Parsons' studies prove conclusively the deep influence which Spanish ideas have had 
upon Zuni culture, and, together with Pro­
fessor Kroeber's investigations, give us one of 
the best examples of acculturation that have 
come to our notice. The psychological expla­
nation is entirely misleading, notwithstanding 
its plausibility , and the historical study shows 
us an entirely different picture, in which the 
unique combination of ancient traits (which in 
themselves are undoubtedly complex) and of 
European influences, have brought about the 
present condition. 
Studies of the dynamics of primitive life also 
show that an assumption of long continued 
stability such as is demanded by Elliot Smith 
is without any foundation in fact. Wherever 
primitive conditions have been studied in 
detail, they can be proved to be in a state of 
flux, and it would seem that there is a close 
parallelism between the history of language 
and the history of general cultural develop­
ment. Periods of stability are followed by 
periods of rapid change. It is exceedingly 
improbable that any customs of primitive 
people should be preserved unchanged for 
thousands of years. Furthermore, the phenom­
ena of acculturation prove that a transfer of 
customs from one region into another without 
concomitant changes due to acculturation, 
are very rare. It is, therefore, very unlikely 
that ancient Mediterranean customs could 
be found at the present time practically 
unchanged in different parts of the globe, as 
Elliot Smith's theory demands. 
While on the whole the unique historical 
character of cultural growth in each area 
stands out as a salient element in the history 
of cultural development, we may recognize at 
the same time that certain typical parallelisms 
do occur. We are, however , not so much 
inclined to look for these similarities in 
detailed customs but rather in certain dynamic 
conditions which are due to social or psycho­
logical causes that are liable to lead to similar 
results. The example of the relation between 
food supply and population to which I referred 
before may serve as an example. Another type 
of example is presented in those cases in which 
a certain problem confronting man may be 
solved by a limited number of methods only. 
When we find, for instance, marriage as a uni­
versal institution, it may be recognized that 

44 FRANZ BOAS 
marriage is possible only between a number of 
men and a number of women; a number of 
men and one woman; a number of women and 
one man; or one man and one woman. As a 
matter of fact, all these forms are found the 
world over and it is, therefore, not surprising 
that analogous forms should have been 
adopted quite independently in different parts 
of the world, and, considering both the general 
economic conditions of mankind and the char­
acter of sexual instinct in the higher animals, 
it also does not seem surprising that group 
marriage and polyandrous marriages should 
be comparatively speaking rare. Similar con­
siderations may also be made in regard to the 
philosophical views held by mankind. In short, 
if we look for laws, the laws relate to the 
effects of physiological, psychological, and 
social conditions, not to sequences of cultural 
achievement. 
In some cases a regular sequence of these 
may accompany the development of the psy­
chological or social status. This is illustrated 
by the sequence of industrial inventions in the 
Old World and in America, which I consider 
as independent. A period of food gathering 
and of the use of stone was followed by the 
invention of agriculture, of pottery and finally 
of the use of metals. Obviously, this order is 
based on the increased amount of time given 
by mankind to the use of natural products, of 
tools and utensils, and to the variations that 
developed with it. Although in this case paral­
lelism seems to exist on the two continents, it 
would be futile to try to follow out the order 
in detail. As a matter of fact, it does not apply 
to other inventions. The domestication of 
animals, which, in the Old World must have 
been an early achievement, was very late in the 
New World, where domesticated animals, 
except the dog, hardly existed at all at the time 
of discove ry. A slight beginning had been made 
in Peru with the domestication of the llama, 
and birds were kept in various parts of the 
continent. 
A similar consideration may be made in 
regard to the development of rationalism. It 
seems to be one of the fundamental character­
istics of the development of mankind that 
activities which have developed unconsciously 
are gradually made the subject of reasoning. 
We may observe this process everywhere. It appears, perhaps, most clearly in the history of 
science which has gradually extended the 
scope of its inquiry over an ever-widening field 
and which has raised into consciousness 
human activities that are automatically per­
formed in the life of the individual and of 
society. 
I have not heretofore referred to another 
aspect of modern ethnology which is con­
nected with the growth of psycho-analysis. 
Sigmund Freud has attempted to show that 
primitive thought is in many respects analo­
gous to those forms of individual psychic 
activity which he has explored by his psycho­
analytical methods. In many respects his 
attempts are similar to the interpretation of 
mythology by symbolists like Stucken. Rivers 
has taken hold of Freud's suggestion as well as 
of the interpretations of Graebner and Elliot 
Smith, and we find, therefore, in his new writ­
ings a peculiar disconnected application of a 
psychologizing attitude and the application of 
the theory of ancient transmission. 
While I believe some of the ideas underlying 
Freud's psycho-analytic studies may be fruit­
fully applied to ethnological problems, it does 
not seem to me that the one-sided exploitation 
of this method will advance our understanding 
of the development of human society. It is cer­
tainly true that the influence of impressions 
received during the first few years of life have 
been entirely underestimated and that the 
social behavior of man depends to a great 
extent upon the earliest habits which are estab­
lished before the time when connected memory 
begins, and that many so-called racial or 
hereditary traits are to be considered rather as 
a result of early exposure to a certain form of 
social conditions. Most of these habits do not 
rise into consciousness and are, therefore, 
broken with difficulty only. Much of the dif­
ference in the behavior of adult male and 
female may go back to this cause. If, however , 
we try to apply the whole theory of the influ­
ence of suppressed desires to the activities of 
man living under different social forms, I think 
we extend beyond their legitimate limits the 
inferences that may be drawn from the obser­
vation of normal and abnormal individual psy­
chology. Many other factors are of greater 
importance. To give an example: The phe­
nomena of language show clearly that condi-

-!HE METHODS OF ETHNOLOGY 45 
tions quite different from those to which 
psycho-analysts direct their attention deter­
mine the mental behavior of man. The general 
concepts underlying language are entirely 
unknown to most people. They do not rise into 
consciousness until the scientific study of 
grammar begins. Nevertheless, the categories 
of language compel us to see the world 
arranged in certain definite conceptual groups 
which, on account of our lack of knowledge 
of linguistic processes, are taken as objective 
categories and which, therefore, impose them­
selves upon the form of our thoughts. It is not 
known what the origin of these categories may 
be, but it seems quite certain that they have 
nothing to do with the phenomena which are 
the subject of psycho-analytic study. 
The applicability of the psycho-analytic 
theory of symbolism is also open to the great­
est doubt. We should remember that symbolic 
interpretation has occupied a prominent posi­
tion in the philosophy of all times. It is present 
not only in primitive life, but the history of 
philosophy and of theology abounds in exam-
. pies of a high development of symbolism, the 
type of which depends upon the general mental 
attitude of the philosopher who develops it. The theologians who interpreted the Bible on 
the basis of religious symbolism were no less 
certain of the correctness of their views, than 
the psycho-analysts are of their interpretations 
of thought and conduct based on sexual sym­
bolism. The results of a symbolic interpreta­
tion depend primarily upon the subjective 
attitude of the investigator who arranges phe­
nomena according to his leading concept. In 
order to prove the applicability of the symbol­
ism of psycho-analysis, it would be necessary 
to show that a symbolic interpretation from 
other entirely different points of view would 
not be equally plausible, and that explanations 
that leave out symbolic significance or reduce 
it to a minimum, would not be adequate. 
While, therefore, we may welcome the 
application of every advance in the method of 
psychological investigation, we cannot accept 
as an advance in ethnological method the 
crude transfer of a novel, one-sided method of 
psychological investigation of the individual to 
social phenomena the origin of which can be 
shown to be historically determined and to be 
subject to influences that are not at all com­
parable to those that control the psychology of 
the individual.
