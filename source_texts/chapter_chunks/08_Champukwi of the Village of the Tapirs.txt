Champukwi of the Village of 
the Tapirs 
Charles Wagley 
Champukwi was not the first person who came 
to mind when a contribution to this volume 
was considered. I thought of Gregorio Martin, 
a dignified and wise old Mayan Indian of 
Santiago Chimaltenango in Guatemala, who in 
1937 had taught me the way of life of his 
people. I thought of Carnirang, the dynamic 
young chieftain whonfl had known in 1941 in 
a village of Tenetehara Indians along the 
Pindare River in northeastern Brazil. I thought 
also of Nhunduca, a gifted and witty story­
teller from a small Amazon commun ity, who 
in 1948 introduced me to the rich folklore of 
the Amazon caboclo or peasant. But then, 
among all the people I had known in the 
various primitive and peasant cultures in 
which I have done ethnological research, I 
chose Champukwi, a man of no outstanding 
talent, yet talented all the same -a man of not 
the highest prestige in his society, yet admired 
by all. For the brief span of about a year he 
was my most intimate friend. 
I knew Champukwi some 20 years ago when 
I lived in his small village of about 175 Tapi­
rape Indians in central Brazil. I must have seen 
him at once, for presents were distributed to 
the whole population on the day of my arrival 
in late April of 1939. But I did not distinguish 
Champukwi as an individual, nor did he, at first, stand out in any way from the other men 
of his village. His name does not appear in the 
notes taken during my first month among the 
Tapirape. 
For me, and even more for Valentim Gomes, 
the Brazilian frontiersman who was my com­
panion and employee, the first weeks in the 
Village of the Tapirs, as the small settlement 
was known, were a period of grappling with a 
strange and often confusing world. The Tapi­
rape Indians lived between the Araguaia and 
Xingu Rivers, an area at that time almost 
entirely isolated from modem Brazil. They had 
been visited by only a few people from the 
"outside" -by one or two missionaries; by 
Herbert Baldus, a German-Brazilian anthro­
pologist; and by a few frontiersmen from the 
Araguaia River. The nearest Brazilian settle­
ment to the Village of the Tapirs was Furo de 
Pedra, a town of 400-500 persons that lay 
some 300 miles away on the Araguaia River. 
Three Tapirape youths had spent a few months 
at mission stations and thus spoke a rudimen­
tary form of Portuguese, using a vocabulary 
limited to a few basic nouns and verbs. At first 
our main problem was communication, but 
these youths were able to help us. Aside from 
them, the only individuals we knew by name 
during the first two weeks were the "'captains," 
the older men who were the heads of the six

large haypile-like houses arranged in a circu­
lar village pattern. These, we later learned, 
were each occupied by a matrilocal extended 
family. But even the personal names -such as 
Oprunxui, Wantanamu, Kamanare, Maria­
pawungo, Okane, and the like -were then 
hard to remember , let alone pronounce. 
During the first weeks in the Village of 
Tapirs, I began to study intensively the Tapi­
rape language, a language belonging to the 
widespread Tupf-Guarani stock. Until I could 
use this language at least passably, I was 
limited to observing and recording only those 
forms of Tapirape culture that the eye could 
see. Even these usually needed explaining. I 
visited the extensive Tapirape gardens in which 
manioc, beans, peanuts, cotton, and other 
native American crops were grown. I watched 
the women fabricate flour from both poison­
ous and "sweet" varieties of manioc, and make 
pots out of clay. I watched the men weave 
baskets out of palm fiber and manufacture -
their bows and arrows as they sat in ham­
mocks in the large palmthatched structure in 
the center of the village circle. This building 
was obviously the men's club, for no women 
ever entered. I rapidly became accustomed to 
nudity. The women wore nothing at all, and 
the men only a palm fiber band around the 
prepuce. But even nude women could be mod­
estly seated, and the men were careful never to 
remove thir palm band to expose the glans 
penis. Obvious also to the uninstructed eye 
was the fact that the Tapirape expressed their 
personal vanity in the elaborate designs care­
fuiiy painted on their bodies with rucu (red) 
and genipa (black). These and many other 
overt aspects of Tapirape culture could be 
recorded in notes and photographs while I 
studied their language. 
The Tapirape, a friendly and humorous 
people, seemed rather pleased with the curious 
strangers in their midst. They found our antics 
amusing; the gales of laughter that accompa­
nied the conversations that we could hear but 
not understand seemed evoked by tales of our 
strange behavior. (It is so easy to presume that 
oneself is the subject of conversation when lis­
tening to a strange language .) Then, of course, 
our presence was materially valuable - for the 
salt, knives, needles, beads, mirrors, and other 
presents we brought were greatly appreciated. However, within a very short time some of 
these people began to emerge as individuals. 
Awanchowa, a small boy of about 6, followed 
me about and literally haunted our little house, 
staring at our large bag of salt which he ate 
with the same relish children in other cultures 
eat sweets. Then there was Tanui, a woman of 
middle age (whose hair was cropped short 
indicating that a near relative had recently 
died} who often brought us presents of food. 
Gradually most of the villagers emerged as dis­
tinctive personalities and among them was 
Champukwi. I cannot remember when I first 
came to know him as an individual, but his 
name begins to appear regularly in field note­
books about one month after our arrival. 
Soon, he became my best informant, and after 
a time, an inseparable companion. 
In 1939 Champukwi must have been about 
_25 years of age. He was tall for a Tapirape 
male, measuring perhaps about 5 feet 6 inches, 
strongly built but lean, and weighing, I should 
judge, about 150 lbs. Like all Tapirape men he 
wore his hair in bangs across his forehead with 
a braided pigtail tied at the back of his neck. 
He was somewhat of a dandy, for his feet and 
the calves of his legs were painted bright red 
every evening with rucu. From time to time he 
painted an intricate design on his body, and he 
wore crocheted disc-like wrist ornaments of 
cotton string dyed red. He was obviously a 
man of some prestige among men of his age, 
for youths and younger men treated him with 
deference, always finding a seat for him on the 
bench that was built against one wall of our 
house. I soon learned that he, too, had spent 
a short period at a mission station several years 
earlier and that he knew a few words of 
Portuguese. He was married and had a daugh­
ter about 2 years of age. His wife, hardly 
attractive according to my American tastes, 
appeared to be somewhat older than he, and 
was pregnant when we first met. 
Champukwi seemed more patient than other 
Tapirape with my attempts to use his language 
and to seek information. He would repeat a 
word, a phrase, or a sentence several times so 
that I might write it down phonetically. He 
resorted to his meager Portuguese and even 
to mimicry to explain what was meant. His 
patience was of course requited by gifts of 
beads, hardware, and salt which I provided 

CHAMPUK WI OF THE VILLAGE OF THE TAPIRS 129 
judiciously from time to time. After a few days, 
I began noting questions to be asked of Cham­
pukwi in the late afternoon when he now 
habitually visited our house. But this was the 
time that others also liked to visit. At this 
hour of the day our house was often crowded 
with men, women, children, and even pets -
monkeys, parrots, and wild pigs - for which 
the Tapirape along with other Brazilian tribes 
have an especial fondness. Such social gather­
ings were hardly conducive to the ethnological 
interview or even to the systematic recording 
of vocabula ry. So I asked Champukwi if I 
might go with him to his garden. There, alter­
nating between helping him cut brush from his 
garden site and sitting in the shade, I was able 
to conduct a kind of haphazard interview. 
Often, while he worked, I formulated ques­
tions in my halting Tapirape and I was able by 
repetition to understand his answers. Although 
the Tapirape villagers began to joke of Cham­
pukwi's new garden site as belonging to the 
two of us, these days were very valuable for 
my research. 
Walking through the forest to and from 
Champukwi's garden, we often hunted for 
;acu, a large forest fowl rather like a chicken. 
I attemped to teach Champukwi how to use 
my .22 rifle, but he had difficulty understand­
ing the gunsights and missed continual ly. He 
attempted to show me how to "see" the ;acu 
hidden in the thick branches of the trees, but 
I seldom caught sight of the birds until they 
had flown. Thus, our complementary incapac­
ities combined to make our hunting in the 
tropical forest quite unproductive, and in 
disgust Champukwi often resorted to his bow 
and arrow. Only later in the year, after he had 
practiced a great deal by shooting at tin cans 
did Champukwi master the use of the rifle, and 
this new-found skill greatly added to his pres­
tige among the Tapirape. 
My abiding friendship with Champukwi 
perhaps really began when I came down with 
malaria about six weeks after our arrival. 
During the first days of my illness, I was obliv­
ious to my surroundings. I am told that while 
one panche, or medicine man, predicted my 
death, another tried to cure me by massage, by 
blowing tobacco smoke over my body, and by 
attempting to suck out the "object, that was 
causing the fever. Evidently his efforts -plus the atabrine tablets administered by Valentim 
Gomes -were successful, for my fever abated. 
I realized, however, that convalescence would 
be slow. Unable to leave the house for almost 
three weeks, I spent my days and evenings sus­
pended in a large Brazilian hammock. In this 
state of enervation, I must have been the very 
picture of the languid white man in the tropics. 
Each late afternoon our house became a 
gathering place for the Tapirape villagers, who 
came not only to visit with me (communica­
tion was still difficult) but also with each other, 
and to gaze upon the belongings of the tori 
(non-Indian). My illness proved to be a boon 
for ethnographic research. People were more 
patient with the sick anthropologist than with 
the well one. They told stories, not only for my 
benefit, but also to entertain each other. In 
attempting to explain to me about a mytho­
logical culture hero, a man would find himself 
telling a myth to the attending audience. Thus, 
I heard (and saw) Tapirape stories told as 
they should be - as dramatic forms spoken 
with vivacity and replete with mimicry of the 
animals that are so often characters in these 
folktales. With my still imperfect knowledge of 
Tapirape I inevitably lost the thread of the 
story and it had to be retold to me more 
slowly. 
Champukwi was a frequent visitor during 
these days of my convalescence. He came each 
morning on the way to his garden and he 
became accustomed to drinking morning 
coffee with us. And, each late afternoon after 
he had returned from his garden, he came "to 
talk" -often slowly retelling the stories and 
incidents that I had difficulty understanding 
the evening before. Several days during this 
period he did not work in his garden but sat 
for two or three hours talking. He learned 
when he should pause or repeat a phrase or 
sentence in order that I might take notes. He 
came to understand what writing meant, dis­
covering that what I wrote in my notebook I 
could repeat to him later. In time he appreci­
ated the fact that I was not so much interested 
in learning the Tapirape language as I was in 
comprehending the Tapirape way of life. As so 
often is the case when a person understands 
and speaks a foreign language poorly, one 
communicates best with but a single person 
who is accustomed to one's mistakes and one's 

130 CHARLES WAGLEY 
meager vocabulary. Thus, I could understand 
and make myself understood to Champukwi 
better than any other Tapirape. Moreover, 
because he spent long hours in our house, 
he was learning Portuguese from Valentim 
Gomes, and this was an aid in helping me 
translate newly learned words and phrases in 
Tapirape and even helped me understand 
his explanations of Tapirape culture patterns. 
Champukwi thus consciously became my 
teacher , and others came to realize that he was 
teaching me. During the next two months we 
had daily sessions, some very brief and others 
lasting two or more hours. 
In October of 1939, some six months after 
my arrival, I found it necessary to leave the 
Village of the Tapirs to go to Furo de Pedra for 
supplies and to collect mail that was held there 
for me. Valenrim Gomes and I had come up the 
Tapirape River, a tributary of the Araguaia, 
pulled by an outboard motor belonging to 
an anthropological colleague who had since 
returned to the United States. Now we had to 
paddle ourselves downstream. We could expect 
little help from the sluggish current and since 
the river was so low, it might be necessary to 
haul our canoe through shallows. Malaria 
had left me weak and I doubted that I was 
equal to this strenuous task. Several Tapirape 
men, including Champu kwi, were anxious to 
accompany us, but having Indians with us in 
Furo de Pedra was not advisable. First, they 
were susceptible to the common cold, which 
among relatively uncontaminated peoples such 
as these American aborigines often turns into 
a serious, and even fatal, disease. Second, unac­
customed to clothes, money, many foods, and 
other Brazilian customs and forms of etiquette, 
they would be totally dependent upon us 
during our .stay in this frontier community . 
Nevertheless, the temptation to have my best 
informant with me during the trip and during 
our stay in Furo de Pedra was great and so we 
agreed to take Champukwi. 
The trip was made slowly. Two good fron­
tiersmen in a light canoe could have made it in 
three days, but we took eight. Champukwi was 
of little help in the canoe; unlike the riverine 
tribes the Tapirape are a forest people who 
know little about the water, and few of them 
had ever traveled by canoe. Champukwi was 
unusual in that he could swim. Although he had more endurance than I, his efforts at pad­
dling endangered the equilibrium of our canoe. 
However, he could shoot fish with his bow and 
arrow. The dry season had driven game from 
the open savanna which borders the Tapirape 
River so that we were able to kill deer, mutum 
(another species of large forest fowl), and a 
wild goose to supplement the less palatable 
fare we had brought with us. Each night we 
camped on a beach from which we were able 
to collect the eggs of a small turtle, the tracaja, 
that had been buried in the sand. Only the 
mosquitoes which swarmed during sundown 
and early evening marred our trip. The expe­
rience remains one of the most memorable of 
my life, a feeling that was shared, I believe, by 
Valentim Gomes and by Champukwi . 
Champukwi adjusted to Furo de Pedra with 
amazing rapidity. His short visit as a youth to 
.the mission station undoubtedly contributed 
to his quick adaptation although, to be sure, 
there were minor problems and incidents. The 
Brazilians of Furo de Pedra were accustomed 
to Indians, for nearby there was a village of 
semi-civilized Caraja Indians who frequently 
visited and traded in the settlement. Yet, 
Champukwi was a bit of a curiosity -the 
townspeople had seen only one other Tapi­
rape. The local Brazilians invited him into their 
homes and offered him coffee and sweets. Both 
Valentim Gomes and I watched over his move­
ments with all the anxiety of overprotective 
parents for fear that he might be exposed to a 
respiratory infection (he did not contract any} 
or that the hospitality of the local Brazilians 
might persuade him to drink cacha� (sugar 
cane aguardiente}. Alcoholic beverages were 
unknown to the Tapirape who are unlike 
most South American groups in this respect . 
According to Champukwi's own report, he 
tried cachafa only once in Furo de Pedra and 
(quite normally) found it distasteful and 
unpleasant. Yet there were moments that were 
awkward at the time however humorous they 
seem in retrospect. One day when I bought 
several dozen oranges in the street, Cham­
pukwi calmly removed the trousers that had 
been provided for him and made a sack to 
carry home the oranges by tying up the legs. 
In Furo de Pedra, he often went nude in the 
house we had rented for our stay. Even the 
Brazilian woman who came to prepare our 

CHAMPUK WI OF THE VILLAGE OF THE TAPIRS 131 
meals became more or less accustomed to his 
nakedness, but sometimes he forgot to dress 
before saJlying forth into the street. The rural 
Brazilian diet, derived in large measure from 
native Indian foods, seemed to please Cham­
pukwi, but he could not be comfortable eating 
at the table. He preferred during meals to sit 
across the room on a low stool. 
Champukwi's reaction to this rural form of 
Brazilian civilization was not childlike in any 
way. He in turn became an ethnologist. He 
wanted to see gardens that provided the food 
for so many people (Furo de Pedra had hardly 
more than 400 people at that time). He was 
fascinated by the sewing machines with which 
he saw the women working. He attended the 
Catholic ceremonies held in the little chapel. 
He saw pairs of men and women dance face 
to face in semblance of an intimate embrace. 
About these and other strange customs he had 
many questions. But like the inquisitive 
anthropologist who had come to live in his 
village, his own curiosity sometimes became 
obtrusive. He peered into the homes of people 
·and sometimes entered uninvited. And he fol­
lowed the Brazilian women to their rather iso­
lated bathing spot in the Araguaia River to 
discover if there were any anatomical differ­
ences between these women and those in his 
village. He even made sexual advances to 
Brazilian women, actions which, if he had 
known, were very dangerous in view of the 
jealous zeal with which Brazilian males protect 
the honor of their wives and daughters. On the 
whole, however, Champukwi became quite a 
favorite of the local Brazilians during his two 
week visit to Furo de Pedra. His Portuguese 
improved while he visited in their homes, and 
he collected simple presents, such as fish 
hooks, bottles, tin cans, and the like, to take 
home with him. Even during this short period 
away from the village, my work with him con­
tinued. He told me of antagonisms, gossip, and 
schisms in the Tapirape village which he would 
have hesitated to relate on home grounds. He 
told me of adulterous affairs in process and of 
the growing determination among one group 
of kinsmen to assassinate Urukumu, the pow­
erful medicine man, because they suspected 
him of performing death-dealing sorcery. 
After two weeks in Furo de Pedra, I found 
that it would be necessary for Valentim Gomes and me to go to Rio de Janeiro. It was not pos­
sible for Champukwi to accompany us and so 
I arranged for two Brazilian frontiersmen to 
return him to a point on the Tapirape River 
from which he could easily hike to his village 
in a day. Valentim and I then began our slow 
trip up the Araguaia River to the motor road 
and thence to Rio de Janeiro. Two months 
later, rid of malaria and with a new stock of 
supplies, we returned to spend the long rainy 
months from November until the end of May 
in the Village of the Tapirs. Champukwi was 
there to welcome us, and he came each day to 
help repair and enlarge our house. We easily 
fell into our former friendly relationship, now 
strengthened by the experience in common of 
the trip to Furo de Pedra and by the feeling 
which many anthropologists have shared with 
the people of their communities -that anyone 
who returns is an "old friend." 
My return to the village that November 
marked, in a sense, the end of what might be 
called the first phase of my relationship with 
Champukwi as friend and as anthropological 
informant. During the course of at least 200 
hours of conversation (many of which may 
be methodologically dignified as interviews}, I 
had learned much about Champukwi as a 
person as well as about Tapirape culture. I 
knew that as a small boy he had come from 
Fish Village, where his parents had died, to live 
in the Village of the Tapirs. He had lived with 
his father's younger brother, Kamaira, who 
was the leader of a large household. He even 
confided to me his boyhood name; Tapirape 
change their names several times during their 
lifetimes and mention of a person's first child­
hood name, generally that of a fish, an animal, 
or simply descriptive of some personal charac­
teristic, causes laughter among the audience 
and considerable embarrassment to the indi­
vidual. I knew that Champukwi had been 
married before he took his current wife, and 
that his first wife had died in childbirth. He 
revealed that her kinsmen had gossiped that 
her death was caused by his lack of respect for 
the food taboos imposed upon an expectant 
father. This same set of taboos now bothered 
him again. A series of foods, mainly meats and 
particularly venison, is prohibited to fathers of 
infants and to husbands of pregnant women. 

132 CHARLES WAGLEY 
On two excursions to the savanna (which 
abounds with deer) Champukwi had eaten 
venison. Moreover, since the Tapirape identi­
fied cattle with deer, and thus beef with 
venison, he had broken the taboo several addi­
tional rimes by partaking also of this forbid­
den meat. The rather scrawny condition of his 
2-year-old daughter, he feared, resulted from 
his faults. Just after our return to the village in 
early Novemb er, his wife gave birth to a 
second daughter. She had a difficult delivery, 
and he remembered his transgre ssions. Several 
village gossips, without knowing anything 
about his misdeeds, had nevertheless accused 
him of this breach of taboo. 
Champu.kwi's home life was not a happy 
one. He was frequently in conflict with his 
second wife, who had, indeed, considerable 
basis for complaint. She could not claim that 
he was a poor provider, for Champukwi was 
a good hunter and a diligent gardener . But 
he confided to me that he did not find her 
attractive, or at least not. as attractive as other 
women in the village. Champukwi had a lusty 
sense of humor and enjoyed joking with Valen­
tim and me. In this mood he told of his many 
extramarital affairs, which were in truth but 
slightly concealed. I would in any event have 
heard of these liaisons; he gave his paramours 
beads which everyone in the village knew I had 
given him as presents. This practice caused 
trouble for the women because their husbands 
could readily identify the source of the gifts. It 
also created trouble for Champukwi at home. 
His wife complained of his affairs and on 
one occasion, according to Champukwi, she 
attacked him, grabbing him by his pigtail and 
squeezing his exposed testicles until he fell 
helpless into a hammock. On other occasions, 
she retaliate.d in a manner more usual for a 
Tapirape woman -she simply refused to carry 
drinking water from the creek, to cook food 
for him, and to allow him to sleep in the 
hammock which she and Champukwi shared. 
For a Tapirape man to carry drinking water, to 
cook, or to sleep on a mat is considered ridicu­
lously funny. In other circumstances, Cham­
pukwi would have had to seek recourse with 
a female relative. However, to do so would be 
tantamount to a public announcement of his 
marital difficulties; the whole village would 
have known, to their considerable merriment and jest. But having tori friends in the village, 
Champukwi could come quietly to us at night 
to drink water, to ask for something to eat, and 
even to sleep in an extra hammock we had for 
visitors. His affairs were evidently extensive, 
for he once divided all of the adult women of 
the village into two categories -those "I know 
how to talk with" (i.e., to seduce) and those 
"I do not know how to talk with." There were 
many with whom he "could talk." 
Unfortunately, by late November of 1939, I 
knew too much about Champukwi's affairs 
either for his comfort or for mine. His wife 
sometimes came to my house to ask if I knew 
where he had gone (I could generally guess), 
and once an irate husband even came to 
inquire of his whereabouts. His Don Juan 
activities had evidently increased. His friend­
ship with me caused him trouble with other 
Tapirape who were envious of the presents he 
received. The story was circulated that he had 
stolen a pair of scissors which, in fact, I had 
given to him. Moreover, several people caught 
colds, and he was accused of bringing the 
infection from Furo de Pedra (actually it was 
probably transmitted by the frontiersman who 
had helped transport us to the village in 
November). Champukwi sought revenge by 
cutting down one of the main supports of the 
men's house, which promptly caved in. No one 
died or was seriously injured and the destruc­
tion of the men's house was soon forgotten 
since it is normally rebuilt each year. However, 
people continued to criticize Champukwi, 
much of their criticism revolving around his 
relationship with me. There are no realms of 
esoteric secrets in Tapirape culture (as there 
are in many cultures } that must not be revealed 
to an outsider; there is only the "secret" of 
the men from the women that the masked 
dancers are not supernatural beings but merely 
masquerading men, but I had been fully and 
openly brought into the "secret." I was, more­
over, exceedingly careful in conversation never 
to refer to any bit of personal information that 
some informant, Champukwi or another, had 
told me. But rumors were rife in the small 
village-that I was angry and would soon leave 
(I was by then a valuable asset), that Cham­
pukwi told me lies about others, that I refused 
to give a bushknife to a household leader 
because Champukwi had urged me not to do 

CHAMPUKWJ OF THE VILLAGE OF THE TAPIRS 133 
so {I refused because I had already given him 
one bushknife), and the like. 
Champukwi reacted moodily, often vio­
lently, to this situation. I could no longer count 
on his visits nor on our research interviews. He 
now visited us with a glum look on his face, 
and when he was not at once offered coffee, 
he left offended. But the very next day he 
might return, gay and joking, yet without his 
former patience for teaching or explaining 
Tapirape culture. Once he returned tired from 
a hunting trip, and, irritated by his wife, he 
beat her with the flat side of his bushknife and 
marched off in anger, thoughtfully taking the 
family hammock and a basket of manioc flour, 
to sleep four nights in the forest near his 
garden. Soon afterwards, he left his wife to 
take the wife of a younger man. This did not 
become a major scandal in the village. After 
some tense yet calm words between the two 
men, it seemed clear that the young woman 
preferred Champukwi and the abandoned 
husband peacefully moved into the men's 
house. Champukwi' s former wife and their 
two young daughters ' continued to live with 
her relatives as is the Tapirape rule. But the 
switch of spouses caused tension between 
Champukwi and his former wife's kinsmen, 
and between Champukwi and the abandoned 
husband's kinsmen; and, to multiply his woes, 
he now had a new set of in-laws to satisfy. For 
about a month thereafter I rarely saw Cham­
pukwi; he obviously avoided our house. When 
we met in the village or in the men's house, he 
simply said that he was busy repairing his 
house or hunting. 
Discussing emotions with someone from a 
culture as widely different as Tapirape is from 
my own was difficult, and the language barrier 
was still a real one. Although my Tapirape 
vocabulary was increasing, it was hardly 
adequate to probe deeply into emotional 
responses; nor was Champukwi given to intro­
spection. I shall probably never fully under­
stand Champukwi's temporary rejection of 
me, but the cause was probably both socio­
logical and psychological. First, his apparent 
influence with me and our close friendship had 
created antagonism on the part of other vil­
lagers. By rejectiflg the outsider, he now hoped 
to reinstate himself in his own society. A 
secon� deeper and more personal reason, contributed to his rejection of me; he had told 
me too much about himself , and feared that 
he had lost face in the process. Also, it was 
obvious that I was growing less dependent 
upon him for knowledge as my facility with 
the language improved and my information 
about the culture grew. Finally, the rejection 
was not one-sided. Now additional informants 
were desirable for my research. Also, if I 
remember correctly (it is not stated in my note­
books), I was annoyed by Champukwi's 
neglect and disappointed by his lack of loyalty. 
When the heavy rains of late December and 
January set in, we were all more or less con­
fined to the viHage as the rivers and streams 
rose to flood the savanna. What had been 
brooks in the tropical forest became wide 
streams, difficult, and sometimes dangerous, to 
ford. It rained many hours each day. The Tapi­
ra pe women and children spent most of the 
time in their dwellings, and the men and older 
boys lounged in the men's house. Our house 
again became a meeting place. And as this was 
of course an opportune time for interviewing, 
I joined the men in their club or entertained 
visitors at home. I began to see more of Cham­
pukwi - first, in the men's house and then as 
he again became a regular visitor at our house. 
Now, he brought his new (and younger) wife 
with him. He liked to sit up with us late at 
night after the other Tapirape visitors had 
retired to their dwellings or to the men's house 
for the night-long sings that are customary 
during the season of heavy rains. Under the 
light of our gasoline lamp, we again took up 
our study of Tapirape culture. Not once did he 
mention his period of antagonism except to 
complain that the Tapirape gossip too much. 
Sometime late in January there began what 
might be considered the second phase of my 
relationship with Champukwi. Our friendship 
was no less intimate than before, but our con­
versations and more formal interviews were 
not now as frequent. During the next months, 
Champukwi became almost my assistant, an 
entrepreneur of Tapirape culture. He contin­
ued to provide invaluable information, but 
when I became interested in a subject of which 
he knew little, he would recommend that I talk 
to someone else. Though he directed me to 
Urukumn on the subject of medicine men or 
shamans, Charnpukwi himself related dreams 

134 CHARLES WAGLEY 
he had heard other shamans tell. He explained 
that he did not want to become a shaman 
himself, for he had seen grieved relatives beat 
out the brains of Tapirape shamans whom 
they suspected of causing a death by sorcery. 
He was not certain, he said, whether such 
shamans had actually performed sorcery; but 
he reasoned that any shaman might come to 
such an end. Champukwi did have the fre­
quent dreams that are indicative of one's 
powers to become a shaman and, in some of 
this dreams, he saw anchunga, the ghosts and 
supematurals who are the aids of shamans. He 
had told only one or two of his kinsmen about 
this, and he did not want it to be known 
throughout the village lest there be pressure on 
him to train for shamanism. 
Champukwi sketched for me the stories of 
Petura, the Tapirape ancestral hero who stole 
fire from the King Vulture, daylight from the 
night owl, genipa (used for dye) from the 
monkeys, and other items for the Tapirape. 
However, he persuaded Maeurni, an elder 
famous for his knowledge of mythology, to 
relate the details although he himself helped 
considerably to clarify for me the meaning of 
native phrases and to make the stories told by 
Maeumi more fully understandable. Cham­
pukwi also forewarned me of events that I 
might want to witness, events that without his 
warning I might have missed. Such were the 
wrestling matches which took place upon the 
return of a hunting party between those men 
who went on the hunt and those who remained 
at home. He told me of a particularly hand­
some basket a man had made, which I might 
want to add to my collection for the Brazilian 
National Museum. He came to tell me that a 
young woman in a neighboring house was in 
labor, thus enabling me to get a photograph of 
the newborn infant being washed in the 
stream, and he urged the men to celebrate 
for my benefit a ceremony which might easily 
have been omitted. Champukwi was no longer 
merely an informant. He became a participant 
in ethnographic research although, of course, 
he never thought of it in these terms. He 
seemed somehow to understand the anthro­
pologist's task in studying his culture, and in 
the process he gained considerable objectivity 
about his own way of life. 
Yet it must be said that Champukwi did not 
seem to discredit the norms, institutions, and beliefs of his own people. Although he saw 
Valentim and me walk safely down the path 
through the forest late at night, he steadfastly 
refused to do the same; for the path was a 
favorite haunt of the lonely ghosts of deceased 
Tapirape who might harm the living. He rea­
soned that the tori were probably immune to 
this danger. When he was ill, he took the pills 
we urged upon him but he also called in the 
shaman. His curiosity about airplanes, auto­
mobiles, and "gigantic canoes" (passenger 
boats) which he saw pictured in the magazines 
we had brought with us, was great; but he 
boasted that the Tapirape could walk farther 
and faster than any tori or even the Caraja 
(who are a canoe people). In fact, his interest 
in, and enthusiasm for, certain Tapirape activ­
ities seemed to be heightened by our presence. 
Almost all Tapirape ceremonials involve 
choral singing and Champukwi was a singing 
leader of one of the sections of the men's soci­
eties. He was always pleased when we came to 
listen, particularly if we made the motions of 
joining in. He was an excellent wrestler in 
Tapirape style, in which each opponent takes 
a firm grip on the pigtail of the other and 
attempts to throw him to the ground by trip­
ping. Our wrestling match was brief although 
I was much taller than he; and his match with 
Valentim Gomes, who outweighed him by 
more than forty pounds, was a draw. Unlike 
so many who get a glimpse a� ·'a seemingly 
"superior" cultural world, Champukwi never 
became dissatisfied with his own way of life. 
In June of 1940, my period of residence 
among the Tapirape Indians ended. The waters 
on the savanna which had to be crossed afoot 
to get to the Tapirape River where our canoe 
was moored had not completely receded. 
Many Tapirape friends, among them Cham­
pukwi, offered to carry our baggage, made 
lighter after a final distribution of gifts, down 
to the river. The night before our departure a 
festival with the usual songfest was held to 
celebrate the final phase of a ceremony during 
which a youth, this time the nephew of 
Kamiraho, became a man. Some Brazilian 
tribes make this occasion an ordeal by such 
means as applying a frame of stinging wasps 
to the body of the novice, but it is character­
istic of the Tapirape that the "ordeal" consists 
only of decorating the youth with a headdress 
of magnificent red macaw feathers, painting 

CHAMPUK WI OF THE VIllAGE OF THE TAPIRS 135 
his body elaborately, and making him the 
center of dancing and singing -although the 
youth must himself dance continuously for a 
day and a night. Champukwi led the singing 
most of the night, but at dawn he came to our 
house to supervise the packing of our belong­
ings into the basket-like cases made of palm 
which are used for carrying loads of any kind. 
He divided the baggage among the younger 
men. Even some of the older household leaders 
decided to accompany us but they, of course, 
did not carry anything. Our trip was slow 
because everyone was tired after the all-night 
festival and because of the water through 
which we had to wade. At one point, rafts had 
to be made to transport our baggage across a 
still-swollen stream. Since the Tapirape do not 
swim -or, like Champukwi, they swim but 
poorly- it was the job of the tori to swim and 
push the rafts. I had the honor of swimming 
across the stream, pushing the respected chief­
tain, Kamiraho. (How he got back, I shall 
never know.) After a day and a half, we 
. reached the landing on the Tapirape River, and 
the next morning we embarked downriv er. My 
last memory of Champukwi was of him stand­
ing on the bank waving in tori style until our 
boat made the curve of the river. 
I did not return to visit the Tapirape until 
1953, but news of them came to me at inter­
vals. Valentim Gomes returned to the region 
in 1941 as an officer of the Brazilian Indian 
Service, and his post was charged with the pro­
tection of the Tapirape Indians. In his first year 
in this capacity, he wrote me: "I report that I 
was in the viUage of the Tapirape on the 26th 
of July [1941]. They were in good health and 
there were plenty of garden products such as 
manioc, yams, peanuts, and the like. There 
were plenty of bananas. But I am sorry to say 
that after we left them, twenty-nine adults and 
a few children have died. Fifteen women and 
fourteen men died. Among those who died was 
Champukwi, the best informant in the village, 
and our best friend., Several slow exchanges 
of letters brought further details from Valen­
tim. In some manner, perhaps through a visit 
from a Brazilian frontiersman, several Tapi­
rape had contracted common colds. Its fatal­
ness to them is indicated by the name they give 
it-6-6 (6 is the augmentative which might be 
translated as "big, big"). Since they have no knowledge of the process of contagion and 
have not acquired immunity to the common 
cold, the disease spread rapidly throughout the 
village. The Tapirape realized, I knew, that 
colds and other diseases such as measles which 
they had suffered before, were derived from 
visitors. Yet they also believed that death 
resulted from evil magic or sorcery. Why do 
some people who are very sick from colds get 
well, they asked, while others who are no more 
ill, soon die? It is only because those who die 
are the victims of sorcery, they had explained 
to me. So, following many deaths, including 
that of a young man like Champukwi, who 
enjoyed prestige and had many kinsmen, I was 
not surprised to learn from Valentim Gomes 
that the powerful shaman, Urukumu, had been 
assassinated. As Champukwi had told me, sus­
picion of Urukumu had already been growing 
even during my residence in the village. After 
the death of Champukwi, one of his many 
"brothers" (actually a cousin but called by the 
same term as brother in Tapirape) had entered 
Urukumu's house late at night and clubbed 
him to death. To the Tapirape, grief and anger 
are closely related emotions and there is one 
word, iw1-lterahu, that describes either or both 
states of mind. Thus in both word and deed 
grief can be quickly transformed into vengeful 
anger. 
In 1953, when I returned to the Araguaia 
River, I found only fifty persons, the remnants 
of the Tapirape tribe, settled under the protec­
tion of the Brazilian Indian Service in a small 
village near the mouth of the Tapirape River. 
My old companion, Valentim Gomes, was 
the Indian officer in charge. The history of the 
intervening years had been a tragic story; the 
Tapirape had suffered steady depopulation 
from imported diseases and they had been 
attacked by the warlike and hostile Kayapo 
tribe, who had burned their village and carried 
off several younger women. They had been 
forced to leave their own territory to seek the 
protection of the Indian Service, and then 
cattle ranchers encroached upon the Tapirape 
savannas, once rich with game. Champukwi 
was but one of the many victims of this disin­
tegration of Tapirape society. Upon my arrival 
several of Champukwi's surviving relatives met 
me with the traditional "welcome of tears"; to 
the Tapirape, such a return mixes emotions of 
joy at seeing an old friend with the sadness of 

136 CHARLES WAGLEY 
the memory of those who have died during 
the interim. Both the sadness and the joy are 
expressed almost ritually by crying. People 
spoke sympathetically to me of the loss of my 
friend and they brought a young man, who 
had been but a small boy in 1940, but who 
was now known as Champukwi. This boy had 
visited for many months, and had even studied 
a little, with the Dominican missionaries on 
the lower Araguaia River; he therefore spoke 
Portuguese well. He remembered my friend­
ship with his namesake and perhaps felt, as I 
did, some strange bond between us. So again 
for a few days the name of Champukwi was 
entered into my notebook as my source of 
information on Tapirape culture. 
ln the security of our studies and in the class­
room, we claim that anthropology is a social 
science in which regularities of human behav­
ior and of social systems are studied. But, at . 
its source, in the midst of the people with 
whom the anthropologist lives and works, 
field research involves the practice of an art in 
which emotions, subjective attitudes and reac­
tions, and undoubtedly subconscious motiva­
tions participate. Of course, the well-trained 
anthropologist takes all possible precautions 
to be objective and to maintain a detached attitude. He gathers information from a "cross 
section" of the population -from a variety of 
informants selected for their different status 
positions in their society. He interviews, as far 
as is possible, men and women, young and old, 
rich and poor, individuals of high and low 
status, so that his picture of the culture may 
not be distorted. The anthropologist might (he 
seldom has done so) go so far as to keep a 
record of his subjective reactions in an attempt 
to achieve greater objectivity. Yet he is never 
the entirely detached observer he may fancy 
himself to be -nor am I sure that this should 
be so. Anthropological field research is a 
profoundly human endeavor. Faced over a 
long period by a number of individuals, some 
intelligent and some slow, some gay and 
some dour, some placid and some irritable, the 
anthropologist almost inevitably is involved 
.in a complex set of human relations among 
another people just as he is by virtue of his 
membership in his own society. And each 
anthropologist is a distinctive personality and 
each undoubtedly handles in his own way his 
dual role as a sympathetic friend to key infor­
mants and as a scientific observer of a society 
and culture which is not his own. To me, 
Champukwi was, above all, a friend whom I 
shall remember always with warm affection.
