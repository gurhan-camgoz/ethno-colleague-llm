The Taste of 
Ethnographic Things 
Paul Stoller and Cheryl Olkes 
All meats that can endure it I like rare, and I like them high, even to the point of smelling 
bad in many cases. 1 
Like other peoples in Sahelian West Africa, the 
Songhay take great pride in their hospitality. 
"A guest is God in your house,,, goes the 
Songhay adage, and so when strangers are 
accepted as guests in most Songhay com­
pounds they receive the best of what their 
hosts can afford to offer. The host displaces his 
own kin from one of his houses and gives it 
to the guest. He removes the mattress from 
his bed and gives it to the guest. And then he 
orders the kinswoman who prepares the family 
meals to make her best sauces for the guest. 
In 1984 Paul Stoller, an anthropologist, and 
Cheryl Olkes, a sociologist, traveled to Niger 
to conduct a study of the medicinal properties 
of plants used in Songhay ethnomedicine. 
Since both Stoller and Olkes were seasoned 
fieldworkers among the Songhay , they had 
experienced the pleasures of Songhay hospi­
tality. And so when they came to the com­
pound of Adamu Jerutongo, in Tillaberi, they 
were not surprised when Moussa, one of 
Adamu Jenitongo's sons, insisted that they stay 
in his mudbrick house. They were not sur-Montaigne 
prised when Adamu Jenitongo, an old healer 
whom Stoller had known for fifteen years, 
gave them his best straw mattresses. "You will 
sleep well on these," he told them. They were 
not surprised when the old healer told Djebo, 
the wife of his younger son, Moru, to prepare 
fine sauces for them. 
Stoller and Olkes had come to Tillaberi to 
discuss the medicinal properties of plants with 
Adamu Jenitongo, perhaps the most knowl­
edgeable healer in all of western Niger. They 
planned to stay in Tillaberi for two weeks and 
then move on to Mehanna and Wanzerbe, two 
villages in which Stoller had won the confi­
dence of healers. During the two weeks in Till­
aberi, Stoller and Olkes ate a variety of foods 
and sauces. Some days they ate rice with black 
sauce (hoy bi) for lunch and rice with a 
tomato-based sauce flavored with red pepper 
and sorrel for dinner. Some days they ate rice 
cooked in a tomato sauce (suruundu) for lunch 
and millet paste with peanut sauce for dinner. 
All of these sauces contained meat, a rare 
ingredient in most Songhay meals. When

THE TASTE OF ETHNOGRAPHIC THINGS 405 
Songhay entertain Europeans -Stoller and 
Olkes, for example -the staples of the diet do 
not change, but the quality of the sauces does. 
Europeans are guests in Songhay compounds; 
people do not prepare tasteless sauces for 
them! 
People in the neighborhood had the same 
perception: "They have come to visit Adamu 
Jenitongo again. There will be good food in 
the compound." In good times a host spares 
no expense. In bad times Stoller and 0 lkes 
quietly slipped Adamu Jenitongo money so he 
could fulfill his ideal behavior. 
The arrival of Stoller and Olkes in Tillaberi 
that year, in fact, was a bright beacon that 
attracted swarms of the "uninvited" in search 
of savory sauces. At lunch and dinner time vis­
itors would arrive and linger, knowing full well 
that the head of a Songhay household is 
obliged to feed people who happen to show up 
at meal times. 
The "men who came to dinner" were so 
many that poor Djebo had to double the 
amount of food she normally prepared. Djebo 
was a mediocre cook, but the uninvited guests 
didn't seem to mind as they stuffed their 
mouths with rice, meat, and sauce. 
There was one particular guest, whom 
everyone called Gao Boro (literally "the man 
from Gao"), who unabashedly came to break­
fast, lunch, and dinner every day of Stoller and 
Olkes' visit. This man, a refugee (or was it a 
fugitive?) from Gao, in the Republic of Mali, 
had been living hand-to-mouth in Tillaberi for 
four months. He had perfected a terrific rent 
scam to cut his expenses. In Tillaberi, land­
lords will let their properties to anyone who 
promises to pay the rent money at the end of 
the month. Paying at the end of the first month 
is a matter of Songhay honor. At the time of 
our visit, Gao Bora was on his third house. 
When a landlord would come for his money, 
Gao Boro would say he was broke. The owner 
would throw him out, and Gao Boro would 
find another unsuspecting landlord. Stoller 
and Olkes soon realized the direct relationship 
between Gao Bora's neighborliness -he lived 
50 meters from Adamu Jenit ongo's compound 
-and his ability to stretch his food budget. 
Most people in the compound were reasonably 
happy with the food in 1984. Adamu Jeni-tongo's wives -Jemma and Hadjo -did com­
plain about the toughness of the meat. So did 
Adamu Jenitongo. The problem, of course, 
was that Djebo refused to tenderize the meat 
-which had come from local stock - before 
cooking it in the sauce. Olkes suggested that 
Djebo marinate the meat. Djebo smiled at 
Olkes and ignored her advice. The toughness 
of the meat notwithstanding, everyone ate 
Djebo's sauces -until the last day of Stoller 
and Olkes' visit, when Djebo served bad sauce. 
The last day in Tillaberi had been exhaust­
ing. Stoller had had two long sessions with 
Adamu Jenitongo during which they discussed 
the medicinal properties of plants and the 
Songhay philosophy of healing. Olkes had 
seen people in town and at the market. She 
had walked a good eight kilometers under the 
relentless Sahelian sun. At dusk, they each 
washed in the bath house: a three-foot-high 
square mudbrick enclosure equipped with a 
stool, a five-liter bucket, soap, and a plastic 
mug. Refreshed, they sat on one of their straw 
mattresses and waited for Djebo. Smiling, she 
brought them a large casserole of rice and a 
small one of sauce, set them at their feet, and 
gave them two spoons. When Stoller opened 
the small casserole, a sour odor overwhelmed 
them. Stoller saw the nightly procession of 
uninvited guests sauntering into the com­
pound. Olkes wrinkled her nose. 
"What is it?" 
"It's fukko hoy [a sauce made by boiling the 
leaves of the fukko plant]," Stoller said. 
'' Fukko hoy?" 
Stoller stirred the sauce with his spoon; it 
was meatless. "Shine your flashlight on the 
sauce, will you?" Stoller asked Olkes. 
Olkes' flashlight revealed a viscous green 
liquid. ''You can take the first taste," Olkes 
told Stoller. 
"Wait a minute." Stoller picked up the small 
casserole and poured some of the fukko hoy 
over the rice. He put a spoonful of the rice and 
sauce into his mouth. "It's the worst damn 
sauce I've ever eaten," he told Olkes. '"Straight 
fukko hoy seasoned with salt and nothing 
else!" 
Olkes tasted the nee and sauce. "It's 
absolutely awful." 
Like diplomats, Olkes and Stoller ate a little 
bit of the meal before pushing the casseroles 

406 PAUL STOLLER AND CHERYL OLKES 
away. Other people in the compound were less 
polite. Saying the sauce smelled and tasted like 
bird droppings, Moru, Djebo's husband, took 
his rice and sauce and dumped it in the 
compound garbage pit, a two-foot-deep hole 
about six feet in diameter that was littered 
with date palm pits, orange rinds, gristle, 
bones, and trash. "Let the goats eat this crap," 
he said. 
jemma, one of Adamu Jenitongo's two 
wives, said: "This sauce shames us. Djebo has 
brought great shame upon this compoun d." 
Hadjo, Adamu jenitongo's other wife, echoed 
Jemma's comments. "How could anyone 
prepare so horrible a sauce for the guests in 
our compound?" 
Gao Boro, the refugee-fu gitive from Mali, 
arrived for his nightly "European" meal. He 
took one taste of the bad sauce, stood up and 
declared: "I refuse to eat sauce that is not fit 
for an animal. I'm going to Halidou's for my 
dinner tonight." From everyone's perspective, 
the bad sauce was in bad taste. 
The Etiology of Bad Sauce 
Djebo, a young Fulan (Peul) woman, came to 
live in Adamu jerutongo's compound in the 
summer of 1982.2 She had formed an attach­
ment to Moru, a drummer in the possession 
cuJt, and had spent months following him to 
possession ceremonies. Eventually , she moved 
in with him-shameless behavior for a never­
married 15-year-old girl. Still considered too 
young for marriage (most Songhay men do not 
marry until they are 30) 21-year-old Moru was 
a musician whose earnings were erratic. When 
he did have money it flew from his hands, 
which were always open to his "friends." 
Moru and Djebo brought much shame to 
Adamu jenitongo's compound. Although first­
time brides are not expected to be virgins, they 
are expected to avoid shaming their families. 
Adamu Jenitongo could have asked Djebo to 
leave, but he did not. By the time Stoller 
arrived in December 1982, Djebo was visibly 
pregnant. Now, all the neighbors could see 
that Djebo and Moru had been living in sin. 
What to do? One option was abortion, a long­
standing though unpopular Songhay practice. 
Another option was to send Djebo home to have her "fatherless" child, the usual Songhay 
practice. The final option was, of course, mar­
riage. No one wanted an abortion. Moru 
wanted to marry his love. Adamu Jenitongo 
and his wives wanted the pregnant girl to 
return to her mother's compound. 
During Stoller's visit, there were many argu­
ments in the compound about Moru and 
Djebo. 
"What would you do with her?" Adamu 
jenitongo asked Stoller. 
"You're asking me?" 
"Moru should marry a Songhay woman," 
Adamu jenitongo stated. "He should marry 
one of the girls from our home near Simiri. If 
he marries one of our people, everyone will be 
happy. Do you not agree?" he asked Stoller. 
Concealing his uneasiness, Stoller said that 
he agreed. 
Moru, who had been inside his hut, over­
heard the discussion between Stoller and his 
father and ran out to confront them. 
"And what about me, Baba? Doesn't anyone 
ask me, Moru, about my feelings? I want 
Djebo. I want to marry her. I want her to have 
my child." 
Adamu Jenitongo scoffed at Moru. "Marry 
her! First you bring this Fulan woman into my 
compound. Then you make her pregnant, and 
now you want to marry the worthless bitch." 
Adamu Jenitongo turned to Stoller. "What is 
this world coming to? The young people have 
no respect." He turned now to Moru. "You 
live in my household, you eat my food, you 
learn from me our heritage, but you have no 
heart and no mind. You are still a child." 
Moru stormed off to his hut, fuming. 
J emma, his mother, returned from the market 
with meat and spices. Hadjo, her co-wife, 
informed her of the most recent confrontation 
in the compound. Jemma looked at Stoller. 
"Don't you think it is wrong for that worth­
less Fulan woman to be here? Look at her," 
she said loudly, pointing at the girl, who was 
sitting on the threshold of Moru's hut. "She's 
pregnant, but she's here with us. Pregnant 
women must live with their mothers so they 
give birth to healthy babies. Does that worth­
less Fulan do this? No! She sits here. She 
follows Moru to possession dances. Sometimes 
she walks for hours -she and the baby in her 
belly." 

THE TASTE OF ETHNOGRAPHIC THINGS 407 
"Is this bad?" Stoller asked Jemma. 
"They say that a mother who wanders with 
a baby in her belly will produce a monster 
child. That worthless Fulan is breeding a 
monster. I am certain of it." 
"She should be with her mother," Hadjo 
reiterated. 
During Stoller's visit there were also daily 
arguments between Jemma, Moru's mother, 
and Ramatu, Djebo's mother. On one occasion 
Ramatu attempted to drag her daughter back 
to her compound. Djebo broke her mother's 
grip and cursed her. Jemma cursed Djebo for 
cursing her mother. And Ramatu cursed 
Jemma for cursing her daughter . As the two 
older women traded ethnic slurs in Songhay , 
Fulan, and Hausa, a sobbing Djebo told Moru, 
her love, that she was walking into the bush 
to die. Since no one took Djebo at her word, 
they watched her walk toward the mountain. 
Ramatu returned to her compound, Jemma got 
back to her food preparations, and Moru went 
into his hut. 
Two hours passed and Djebo had not 
returned. Moru entered Stoller's hut. "Should 
we go and look for her?" 
"I think so, Moru." 
Stoller and Moru left to search for Djebo. 
They returned with her two hours later. Every­
one in the compound scolded the young girl. 
"You are a hardheaded bitch," Jemma said. 
"You are a worthless Fulan, who brings us 
heartache," Adamu Jenitongo said. 
Djebo cried and Moru followed her into his 
hut. 
When Stoller and Olkes returned to Adamu 
Jenitongo's compound in 1984, a child no 
more than a year and a half old waddled over 
to them. Laterite dust powdered her body. 
Mucus had caked on her upper lip. 
"That's my daughter, Jamilla," Moru 
proclaimed. 
JamiHa burst into tears when Olkes 
approached her. 
"She's not used to white people," Jemma 
said. 
"She's a monster child," Hadjo declared. 
The term "monster child" swept Stoller 
back to his previous visit and the long discus­
sions that had raged about women who 
wander when they are pregnant. Had the pre­
diction come true? "And no wonder," said Jemma, "with a 
mother who wandered the countryside with a 
child in her belly." 
Moru told Stoller that he and Djebo were 
married shortly after his departure the previ­
ous year. 
"And you didn't write?" Stoller joked. 
Moru shrugged. Djebo pounded millet next 
to the compound' s second mudbrick house, 
which Moru had built for his family. "Djebo," 
Moru called to his wife, "prepare a fine meal 
for them. They are tired from their trip, and 
we must honor them." 
Adamu Jenitongo gave Djebo money and 
told her to go to the market and buy good 
spices and a good cut of meat. Djebo took 
the money and frowned. When she had left, 
Moussa (Adamu Jenitongo's other son), 
Jemma, and Moru complained about her. She 
was lazy. She was quarrelsome. They didn't 
trust her. She didn't know how to cook-prob­
ably because she hadn't listened to her mother 
long enough to learn. When she prepared meat 
it was so tough that even Moru couldn't chew 
it. The sauces were tasteless even though 
Adamu Jenitongo gave her money to buy the 
best spices. But no one had done anything to 
improve the domestic situation. 
"Why don't you teach her how to cook?" 
Olkes asked. 
"Hah," Jemma snorted. "She doesn't want 
to learn." 
"Why don't you show her the right spices to 
buy?" Olkes persisted. 
"She doesn't care. She doesn't care," Jemma 
answered. 
Olkes felt sorry for Djebo. She was, after all, 
a teenager living among people who seemed set 
against her and who bore longstanding preju­
dice against her ethnic group. As the youngest 
affine in the compound, moreover , Djebo was 
expected not only to cook, but to buy food in 
the market, take care of her infant, fetch water 
from a neighborhood pump, clean pots and 
pans, and do the laundry. From dawn to dusk, 
Djebo performed these tasks as Jemma and 
Hadjo sat in front of their huts and criticized 
her. 
Olkes decided to befriend Djebo. She 
accompanied Djebo to the pump and to the 
market. On market day, Olkes bought Djebo 
a black shawl, the current rage in Tillaberi. For 

408 PAUL STOLLER AND CHERYL OLKES 
whatever reason -culture, age, or personality 
-Djebo did not respond to these overtures. She 
socialized outside of the compound and did 
not participate in the rambling conversations 
of the early evening. 
One day before Stoller and Olkes' depar­
ture, Djebo prepared a wonderful sauce for the 
noon meal. She made a locust bean sauce fla­
vored with peanut flour. Olkes and Stoller ate 
with abandon. When Djebo came to their 
house to collect the empty casseroles, Olkes 
complime nted her on the meal. 
Stoller raised his arms skyward and said: 
"Praise be to God." 
Saying nothing, Djebo smi led and left their 
house. Thirty minutes later, Djebo returned to 
see Stoller and Olkes -her first social visit in 
rwo weeks. Saying little, she looked over their 
things. She opened the lid of their non-fat dry 
milk and tasted some. She touched their 
camera, and ran her fingers over their tape 
recorder. Olkes and Stoller had seen this kind 
of behavior before. A person in Niger rarely 
asks for money directly; rather, he or she 
lingers in the donor's house and says nothing. 
Djebo lingered in Stoller and Olkes' house for 
thirty minutes and left. 
"Do you understand the reason for that 
scrumptious meal?" Olkes asked Stoller. 
Stoller nodded. "She isn't satisfied with the 
black shawl?" 
"I guess not." 
"Damn her! We can't give her money. We 
have to give money to Adamu Jenitong o." 
"She doesn't want to follow the rules of 
custom, does she?" 
"I just bet that she has been pocketing some 
of the money given to her for food ," Stoller 
said. •'That's why the sauces have been 
mediocre." 
That night Djebo's horrible fukko hoy 
expressed sensually her anger, an anger formed 
from a complex of circumstances. She wanted 
her sauce to be disgusting. 
The Etiology of Taste 
Djebo prepared a sauce to be rejected, cast 
away, spit out. Put another way, Djebo's sauce 
was the symbolic equivalent of vomit, some­
thing that our bodies reject. In the most literal 
sense Djebo's sauce was distastef ul. How does Djebo's sour sauce -her calcu­
lated distastefulness -fit with the conception 
of Taste in the Western philosophical tradi­
tion? In a word, it is differem; it is non­
theoretical. 
One of the earliest writers on taste was Seneca. 
In his Epistulae mo rales he wrote that food not 
only nourishes our bodies, but also 
nourishes our higher nature, -we should see 
to it that whatever we have absorbed should 
not be allowed to remain unchanged, or it will 
be no part of us. We must digest it; otherwise 
it will merely enter memory and not the rea­
soning power. Let us loyally welcome such 
foods and make them our own, so that some­
thing that is one may be formed out of many 
elements.3 
Seneca was among the first of the classical 
philosophers to write of judgment with diges­
tive metaphors. "For Seneca, the proper diges­
tion of received ideas both educates and is the 
result of an independent faculty of judgment, 
and this in tum is the precondition of right 
action. "4 These metaphors stem from the clas­
sical notion that the mouth and tongue enable 
us to "ingese' the outside world. Physical 
tasting is extended to mental tasting, the clas­
sical notion of judgment. 5 
In his Critique of judgment, Kant rejects the 
classical notion that the faculty of taste can be 
extended to social, political, or scientific 
matters. In fact, he removes taste entirely from 
the domain of science, preferring to consider it 
a purely aesthetic sense. 
In order to distinguish whether anything is 
beautiful or not, we refer the representation, 
not by the understanding to the object for 
cognition, but by imagination (perhaps in 
conjunction with the understanding) to the 
subject and its feeling of pleasure and pain. 
The judgment of taste is therefore not a judg­
ment of cognition, and is consequently not 
logical but aesthetical, by which we under­
stand that those determining grounds can be 
no other than subjective. 6 
Kant's passage suggests that the faculty of taste 
should be restricted to the apprehension of 
objects of beauty. Following the publication of 
the Critique of judgment in 1790, taste was no 
longer considered an appropriate concept in 

THE TASTE OF ETHNOGRAPHIC THINGS 409 
the classically approved domains of politics, 
society and science -domains that were 
restricted to the logical, objective, and scien­
tific reflection of the Enlight enment. 
The etymology of taste in English 
Raymond Williams writes that the word taste 
came into the English language around the 
thirteenth century, but that its earliest meaning 
was closer to "touch" or ''feel."7 "Taste" 
comes to us from the Old French taster, and 
from the Italian tastare, which translates to 
"feel, handle, or touch." "Good taast" in the 
sense of good understanding was recorded in 
1425.8 But the metaphoric extensions of the 
word became confused in the latter part of 
the seventeenth century and the eighteenth 
century, when it was associated with general 
rules. In English, then, the sensual aspects of 
taste were gradually replaced by the more 
general and rule-governed notion. Perhaps due 
to the Kantian influence, the meanings of taste 
and good taste are even today far removed 
from their sensual attributes. Djebo's sense of 
taste is sensual and subjective; Kant's sense of 
Taste is rarefied and objective. 
The sensual tastes of Montaigne 
Djebo's non-theoretical sense of taste is similar 
to Montaigne's. The final section of his Essais, 
entitled ''Of Experience," is a compendium of 
Montaigne's physical tastes: what he likes to 
eat, how o&en he likes to eat, how much he 
likes to eat. In this final book, Montaigne dis­
cusses his sleeping habits, his kidney stones, 
his medicines, his squeamishness, his hatred of 
sweets as a child and his love of sweets as an 
adult, his digestion, his indigestion, and even 
his bowel movements. On the subject of 
bowels, Montaigne also writes that "both 
Kings and philosophers defecate, and ladies 
roo .... Wherefore I will say this about that 
action: that we should relegate it to certain 
prescribed nocturnal hours, and force and 
subject ourselves to them by habit, as I have 
done. ,9 Montaigne's "father hated all kinds of 
sauces; I love them all. Eating too much 
bothers me; but I have as yet no really certain 
knowledge that any kind of food intrinsically 
disagrees with me.,, 10 AJas, Montaigne never 
ate Djebo's fukko hoy. Derrida' s dregs 
Montaigne' s sensuality has had a minimal 
influence on Western thought, however . More 
prevalent today are the rarefied Enlightenment 
metaphors of composition and construction. 
In Hegel's constructive system, for example, 
"the material of ideality is light and sound. 
Voice, in the relation to hearing (the most 
sublime sense), animates sound, permitting the 
passage from more sensible existence to the 
representational existence of the concept.'' 11 
Sight and hearing are theoretical senses that 
represent the attempt of the Enlightenment 
philosophers to create from the chaos of 
appearances constructed systems of "'reality," 
wherein one might Taste the Truth. 
In sharp contrast to historical and modern 
masters of philosophy, Derrida stands for sen­
suality as opposed to rarefaction, for decon­
structionism as opposed to constructionism, 
for decomposition as opposed to Taste. In Of 
Grammatology and in Glas, Derrida indicates 
a philosophical system based upon such non­
theoretical senses as taste (also smell and 
touch) which depend upon a pan of the body, 
the tongue, which is primary in speech 
production: 
The dividing membrane which is called the 
soft palate, fixed by its upper edge to the 
border of the roof, floats freely, at its lower 
end, above the base of the tongue. Its two 
lateral sides (it is a quadrilat eral) are called 
"pillars." In the middle of the floating end, at 
the entrance to the throat, hangs the fleshy 
appendage of the uvula, like a small grape. 
The text is spit out. It is like a discourse in 
which the unities model themselves after an 
excrement, a secretion. And because it has to 
do here with a glottic gesture, the tongue 
working on itself, saliva is the element which 
sticks the unities rogerher. 12 
As Ulmer suggests, Derrida 's texts condemn 
Hegel's assertion that odor and taste "are 
useless for artistic pleasure, given that esthetic 
contemplation requires objectivity without ref­
erence to desire or will, whereas 'things present 
themselves to smell only to the degree in which 
they are constituted by a process, in which they 
dissolve into the air with practical effects.'" 13 
For Derrida there should be no separation of 
the intelligible from the sensible. Since Kant, 

410 PAUL STOLLER AND CHERYL OLKES 
he argues, Taste has been an objective, rarefied 
distancing from an object of art. Using the 
sensual Montaigne as one of his models, 
Derrida opposes gustus with disgust and taste 
with distaste. The key concept of Derrida 's 
writing on taste is /e vomi, "which explicitly 
engages not the 'objective' senses of hearing 
and sight, nor even touch, which Kant 
describes . as 'mechanical,' all three of which 
involve perception of or at surfaces, but the 
'subjective' or 'chemical' senses of taste and 
smell. "14 For Derrida, then, Dj ebo's fukko hoy 
should not only be spit out into an ethno­
graphic text, but should be done so with 
sensual vividness, for Djebo's bad sauce is glo­
riously disgusting; it reeks with meaning. 
Taste in anthropology 
Beyond the sensual descriptions in anthropo­
logical cookbooks, most anthropologists have 
followed Hegel's lead in separating the intelli­
gible from the sensible. This Hegelian tendency 
is evident from even a cursory examination of 
ethnographic writing. Like most writers, most 
ethnographers tacitly conform to a set of con­
ventions that colleagues use to judge a work. 
Marcus and Cushman have suggested that 
conventions governing ethnographic represen­
tation devolve from realism. They argue that 
realist ethnographic discourse seeks the reality 
of the whole of a given society, and that 
"realist ethnographies are written to allude to 
the whole by means of parts or foci of analyt­
ical attention which constantly evoke a social 
and cultural totality." 15 In an article in 
L'Homme, Stoller describes the philosophical 
development of realism in ethnography .16 That 
development eventually resulted in a set of 
conventions that Marcus and Cushman have 
analyzed: 
1 a narrative structure which devolves from 
cultural, functionalist, or structuralist ana­
lytical categories to achieve a total ethnog­
raphy; 
2 a third person narrative voice which dis­
tinguishes realist ethnographies from travel 
accounts; 
3 a manner of presentation in which indi­
viduals among the people studied remain 
nameless, characterless; 4 a section of text, usually a Preface or After­
word, which describes the context of inves­
tigation; 
5 a focus on everyday life contexts repre­
senting the Other's reality to justify the fit 
of the analytical framework to the ethno­
graphic situation; 
6 an assertion that the ethnography repre­
sents the native's point of view; 
7 a generalizing style in which events are 
rarely described idiosyncratical ly, bur 
as typical manifestations of marriage, 
kinship, ritual, etc.; 
8 a use of jargon which signals that the text 
is, indeed, an ethnography as opposed to a 
travel account; 
9 a reticence by authors to discuss their com­
petence in the Other's language.17 
While most ethnographers religiously followed 
these conventions of realist representation in 
the past, there are a growing number of schol­
ars who are worried about the epistemolo gical 
and political ramifications of ethnographic 
realism. Directly and indirectly, their ethno­
graphic and theoretical writings reflect these 
philosophic issues.18 Fabian writes of his 
concern about anthropol ogy's intel1ectual 
imperialism: "Perhaps I failed to make it clear 
that I wanted language and communication to 
be under stood as a kind of praxis in which the 
Knower cannot claim ascendency over the 
Known (nor, for that matter, one Knower over 
another). As I see it now, the anthropo logist 
and his interlocuters only 'know' when 
they meet each other in one and the same 
contemporality." 19 
Although the new "experimental" works have 
been provocative, most of them consider 
typical anthropological subjects of study, 
albeit through partially altered conventions 
of representation. How could it be otherwise, 
when disciplinary constraints force most 
writers to concentrate on certain kinds of sub­
jects: the theory of Taste instead of the taste of 
bad sauce, the theory of the family instead of 
texts that familiarize the reader with family 
members, the theory of experimental ethnog­
raphy instead of experimental ethnographie s. 
How can it be otherwise, when disciplinary 
constraints impose form and order on what is 

THE TASTE OF ETHNOGRAPHIC THINGS 411 
published. Take, for example, the Abstracts of 
the Annual {Anthropol ogy] Meetings: 
Name, institution, and title of paper or film 
must precede narrative portion: Put last name 
first; use capital letters for author's last name 
and title of paper; do not include 'university' 
or 'college' with institution name given in 
parentheses .... Write the text in complete 
sentences. Use the present tense; use only third 
person.20 
In addition, the American Anthropological 
Association gives prospective participants 
some useful tips on writing a "good abstract": 
A "good" abstract should be an informative 
summary of a longer work. It should state the 
central topic at the beginning; it should clearly 
indicate the nature and extent of the data on 
which it is based; it should outline the nature 
of the problem or issue and delineate the rel­
evant scientific argument; and it should show 
how the content relates to the existing litera­
ture. Where helpful, citations may be used. 
The abstract must be typed double spaced, 
and it must fit within the box provided 
below.21 
This prescription may be a fine model for terse 
scientific writing, but it discourages unconven­
tionality in ethnographic writing with the 
message it sends to potential Annual Meeting 
participants: "We are a scientific organization. 
We sponsor scientific papers in our scientific 
program ." Good or "beautiful" abstracts, in 
the sense of Kant and Hegel, are written in the 
present tense (the ethnographic present?) and 
in the third person (a marker of objectivity?) 
Even today, Hegel's Esthetics casts a long 
shadow over anthropological represen tation. 
Despite the difficulties precipitated by a long 
entrenched philosophical tradition, it is alto­
gether certain that the pioneering and coura� 
geous efforts of contemporary ethnographers 
have forced anthropologists ro ponder the 
nature of both their scholarship and their 
being. But do these writers take us far enough? 
Are there other dimensions of ethnographic 
discourse, other conventions of representation 
which may carry anthropology deeper into the 
being of the others? Are there other modes of 
representation that better solve the fundamen­
tal problems of realist ethnographic represen­
tation: voice, authority,. and authenticity? Tasteful Ethnography 
How does a piece of ethnographic writing get 
published? Here the digestive metaphors are 
particularly relevant. An author submits her or 
his manuscript to a publisher or to a journal. 
Editors ingest the manuscript. If the material 
falls within the conventions of representation 
of a discipline, the editors are likely to digest 
what they have taken in and the manuscript 
will eventually be published. If the material 
violates those conventions, the editors may 
well find the piece hard to swallow and the 
manuscript is returned to the author, a case of 
Derrida 's vomi. Indeed, when editors write 
comments to authors of rejected (vomited) 
manuscripts, they often suggest how the 
author might transform his or her piece from 
disgusting vomit into digestible food for 
thought. Examples of these comments from 
Stoller's files illustrate how readers and editors 
reinforce conventional anthropological tastes. 
Exarnple 1 [Letter from acquisitions editor to 
Stoller]. I have just received two reviews of 
your manuscript, and I'm sorry to have to tell 
you that these have not been sufficienrly 
encouraging for me to feel able to offer to con­
sider the work further. Both reviewers thought 
that the script contained some interesting 
data, but felt that the theoretical argument 
was insufficienrly well developed. 
Example 2 [Comments from Stoller to �mony­
mous author]. The author of this article sug­
gests that anthropologists consider music more 
seriously , less tangentially, in their analyses of 
sociocultural systems. Merriman made more 
or less the same statement in his pioneering 
Anthropology of Music (1964), which the 
author unfortunately does nor eire .... The 
author leads one ro believe that we should con­
sider the sociocultural aspects of music seri­
ously. I fully agree. After reading the piece, 
however, I feel the author has fallen into the 
trap he/she says other anthropologists have 
fallen into. Music is not the central concern of 
this article; it is of secondary or perhaps ter­
tiary importance when compared with the 
author's overriding concern with subsistence 
and the materialist perspective .... Ln short the 
author fails to highlight the importance of 
music in the cultural scheme of things .... 

412 PAUL STOLLER AND CHERYL OLKES 
Example 3 [Comments of Stoller to anony­
mous author]. ln this piece the reader is treated 
to a plethora of excellent ethnography in which 
the author develops the sociological context of 
x's name change. But the author does not blend 
this rich material with other studies in Africa 
or elsewhere which are on similar topics .... 
What kind of contribution does this piece 
make to ethnological theory, method, com­
pared to other works on the topic? ... 
Example 4 [Reader's comments to Stoller]. I 
sympathize with the author's desire to go 
beyond the limits of positivism and enter into 
the mental set of the people he studies, though 
he might take note that this is the point of 
departure espoused by such diverse scholars 
as Boas, Malinowski, and Radin, among 
others. My objection to the work is not in his 
effort to seek an inside viewpoint, but in his 
failure to demonstrate its value, and, above 
all, in his failure to meet the canons of acad­
emic evidence. One must presume that the 
young man in his narrative was himself-but 
his unwillingness to communicate in the sci­
entific mode and to adhere to the Songhay 
rules, deprives us of direct evidence for this 
insight and makes us wonder at the source 
and character of his information. 
Example 5 [Reader's comments to Stoller]. 
This is basically a suitable article for the ... , 
since it has an interesting and significant point 
to make concerning the need to recognize the 
importance of sound in many societies. I feel, 
however, that many readers would not be 
gripped enough at the beginning of the article 
[a narrative with dialogue] ... to see it 
through to the end .... My personal prefer­
ence is for less humanistic and subjective lan­
guage. 
Example 6 [Reader's comments on Stoller's 
manuscript] .... There is no question that the 
subject matter is important and underrepre­
sented in the literature, or thar the author has 
some very valuable field data in hand. It 
would be quite useful to have a good study of 
Songhay religion and culture .... While there 
is some interesting description of possession 
rituals, and of Songhay religion and history, if 
I have to judge it frankly I must say that at 
this point it is a half-baked manuscript. 
The weakness of its theoretical grounding 
leads to the lack of any real integration of the 
descriptive material beyond the repeated (and ultimately somewhat boring) assertion that 
the cults are forms of cultural resistance .. .. 1 
think there are two central points of weak­
ness, which the author glides over at the 
beginning where he casually dismisses psy­
chological and functional accounts: he shows 
no evidence of having read the work of Victor 
Turner ... and he shows no evidence of famil­
iarity with the recent studies of the psy­
chophysiolo gy of trance which have made 
such rapid advances in our understanding of 
these phenomena .... 
And so it goes in the modern era of anthro­
pology, an era that in many ways is past its 
shelflife. 21 One way of freeing ourselves from 
the constraints of Taste in Anthropology is to 
engage fully in a tasteful ethnography . Freed 
from the social, political, and epistemolo gical 
constraints of realism, a tasteful ethnography 
would take us beyond the mind's eye and into 
the domain of the senses of smell and taste. 
Such an excursion into sensuality would com­
plement the rarefied Hegelian senses of sight 
and sound. 
Tasteful fieldwork 
In tasteful fieldwork, anthropo logists would 
not only investigate kinship, exchange, and 
symbolism, but also describe with literary 
vividness the smells, tastes, and textures of the 
land, the people, and the food. Rather than 
looking for deep-seated hidden truths, the 
tasteful fieldworker understands, followin g 
Foucault, "that the deep hidden meaning, the 
unreachable heights of truth, the murky inte­
riors of consciousness are all shams. "23 From 
the sensual tasteful vantage, the fieldworker 
investigates the life stories of individual 
Songhay , Nuer, or Trobrianders as opposed to 
totalized investigations of the Songhay, the 
Nuer, or the Trobriander. This recording of the 
complexit ies of the individual' s social experi­
ence lends texture to the landscape of the 
fieldworker's notes. In this way , seemingly 
insignificant incidents as being served bad 
sauce become as important as sitting with a 
nameless informant and recording genealogies 
-data -that eventually become compon ents 
in a system of kinship. In this way ethno­
graphic research creates voice, authorit y, and 
an aura of authenticity. 

THE TASTE OF ETHNOGRAPHIC THINGS 413 
Tasteful writing 
There are probably many anthropologists who 
do engage in tasteful fieldwork. Despite their 
scientific objectives, they become sensually 
immersed in their field surroundings. These 
impressions, however , are usually cast aside -
becoming vomit -in their published theoreti­
cal and ethnographic writings. Like Djebo's 
bad sauce, conventions of representation gov­
erning genre selection could be thrown into a 
trash pit. 
Acknowledging the diverse collection of 
refuse, the tasteful writer uses the notion of 
melange as his or her guiding metaphor for 
producing tasteful ethnographic writing. 
In Derrida's Glas, the writing on the pages 
is arranged in two columns. In the left-hand 
colum� is prose representing Hegel (rarefac­
tion, Taste, the Enlightenment and its theoret­
ical senses). In the right-hand column, by 
contrast, is prose representing Genet (sensual­
ity, taste, post-modernism and its non­
theoretical senses). Within this revolutionary 
stylistics is a powerful indirect challenge to the 
fundamental metaphors of the Western philo­
sophic tradition. Derrida's Glas is in bad Taste. 
But Derrida' s bad Taste-his vomit-provides 
a point of reference for tasteful ethnographic 
writing that incorporates the non-theoretical 
senses. 
Consider first an example from James Agee's 
Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, in which he 
describes the odors of a tenant farm house in 
Alabama. 
These are its ingredients. The odor of pine 
lumber, wide thin cards of it, heated in the 
sun, in no way doubled or insulated, in closed 
and darkened air. The odor of woodsmoke, 
the fuel being again mainly pine, but in part 
also, hickory, oak and cedar. The odors of 
cooking. Among these, most strongly , the 
odors of fried salt pork and of fried and boiled 
pork lard, and second, the odor of cooked 
corn. The odors of sweat in many stages of 
age and freshness, this swear being a distilla­
tion of pork, lard, corn, woodsmoke, pine and 
ammonia. The odors of sleep, of bedding and 
of breathing, for the ventilation is poor. The 
odors of all the dirt that in the course of time 
can accumulate in a quilt and mattress. Odors 
of staleness from clothes hung or stored away, not washed. I should further describe the odor 
of corn: in swear, or on the teeth and the 
breath, when it is eaten as much as they eat 
it, it is of a particular sweet stuffy fetor, to 
which the nearest parallel is the odor of the 
yellow excrement of a baby .. .. 24 
Consider next an example from John Cher­
noff's African Rhythm and African Sensibility, 
in which he describes how music and African 
social life interpenetrate. 
At the beginning of each year the harmattan 
winds blow a fine dust from the Sahara Desert 
across the Sudan and over the coastal areas of 
the Gulf of Guinea. In Bamako, capital of 
Mali, you might observe the evening traffic as 
if through a reddish brown filter which softens 
and mutes the sights and sounds of the 
crowded streets. The atmosphere is tranquil, 
and standing on the long bridge over the 
Niger River , with cars passing just a few feet 
behind you, you might look at a lone fisher­
man in his graceful canoe and feel that only 
the lovely melodies of the harp-like kor a could 
capture and convey the unity of the scene. At 
night the temperature drops until you might 
wonder why you ever thought you missed 
winter, and if by chance you found yourself in 
an isolated village at the right time and you 
looked up at the multitude of stars, you might 
hear the music of xylophones through the 
crisp air and believe that the clarity of the 
music was perhaps more than superficially 
appropriate to the stillness of the night.15 
Consider finally an example from Levi­
Strauss's Tristes tropiques, "which, though it 
is very far from being a great anthropology 
book, or even an especially good one, is surely 
one of the finest books ever written by an 
anthropologist. "26 The example is an exegesis 
on the South American equivalent of bad 
sauce. 
There had been no rain for five months and 
all the game had vanished. We were lucky if 
we managed to shoot an emaciated parrot or 
capture a large tupinambis lizard to boil in 
our rice, or managed to roast in their shells a 
land tortoise or an armadillo with black, oily 
flesh. More often than not, we had to be 
content with xarque, the same dried meat 
prepared months previously by a butcher in 
Cuiaba and the thick worm-inf ested layers of 

414 PAUL STOLLER AND CHERYL OLKES 
which we unrolled every morning in the sun, 
in order to make them less noxious, although 
they were usually in the same state the next 
day. Once, however, someone killed a wild 
pig; its Lightly cooked flesh seemed to us more 
intoxicating than wine: each of us devoured 
more than a pound of it, and at that moment 
I understood the alleged gluttony of savages, 
which is mentioned by so many travellers as 
proof of their uncouthness. One only had to 
share their diet to experience similar pangs of 
hunger; to eat one's fill in such circumstances 
produces not merely a feeling of repletion but 
a positive sensation of bliss.27 
These examples are only a slice of the life that 
lives in the tasteful ethnographies of Agee, 
Chernoff, and Levi-Strauss. In all the exam­
ples, the writers season their prose with the 
non-theoretical senses to evoke a world. Agee 
masterfully uses a melange of smells to evoke 
the habitus of southern tenant farmers -their. 
fatty diet, their filthy clothes, their stuffy 
houses, their abject misery. In one smelly para­
graph we have a memorable portrait of the 
lives of these people. Chernoff records the 
interpenetration of sound and sight in African 
social life. This paragraph evokes an African 
world in which .. participatory" music gives 
shape to a people's system of values as well as 
to their manner of living-in-the-world. With 
Levi-Strauss we come back to the sensual 
notion of taste. In one vivid paragraph he 
ruminat es on the link between deprivation of 
diet and gluttony in the Amazon. Even Euro­
pean intellectuals can descend into gluttony! 
Should this kind of writing be excised 
from the ethnographic manuscri pts of the 
future? Aren't expositions on odors� sounds, 
and tastes extraneous to the ethnographic 
message? What can these details reveal about 
a sociocultural system? In terms of systematic 
analysis, these kinds of evocative details do 
not uncover a system of kinship or exchange 
or symbolism; hence Geertz's critique of 
Tristes tropiques as not even a good anthro­
pology book. Tasteful anthropology books are 
analytic, theoretical, and ephemeral; tasteful 
ethnographies are descriptive, non-theoretical, 
and memorable. Writers of tasteful ethnogra­
phies mix an assortment of ingredients -
dialogue, description, metaphor, metonomy , synecdoche, irony, smells, sights, and sounds -
to create a narrative that savors the world of 
the Other. And just as Chernof f's drumming in 
Ghana once inspired members of an audience 
to say: "'Oh, the way you played! It moved 
me. It was sweet,' , so a well constructed nar­
rative moves the listener or the reader to say: 
"Can I tell you a terrific story?, Indeed, there 
is life in the words of a good story; there is life 
in the prose of a tasteful ethnograp hy. 
In his monumental essay L'Oeil et /'esprit, 
Merleau -Ponty states that we lose much of the 
substance of life-in-the-world by thinking 
operationally, by defining rather than experi­
encing the reality of things. 
Science manipulates things and gives up living 
in them. It makes its own limited models of 
things; operating upon these indices or vari­
ables to effect whatever transformations are 
permitted by their definition; it comes face to 
face with the real world only at rare interva ls. 
Science is and always has been that admirably 
active, ingenious, and bold way of thinking 
whose fundamental bias is to treat everything 
as though it were an object-in-general -as 
though it meant nothing to us and yet was 
predestined for our own use. 28 
An ethnographic discourse that "comes face to 
face with the real world only at rare intervals" 
is usually so turgid that it is digestible by only 
a few dedicated specialists - a discourse that 
will soon be forgotten. A tasteful ethnographic 
discourse that takes the notion of melange as its 
foundation would encourage writers to blend 
the ingredients of a world so that bad sauces 
might be transformed into delicious prose. 
One Month of Bad Sauce 
among the Songhay 
Stoller returned to Songhay and Adamu Jeni­
rongo's compound in June of 1987. jamilla had 
died in 1985, having drowned in a garbage pit 
filled with water after a torrential rain. Soon 
thereafter Djebo was pregnant with Hamadu, 
who in 1987 was about 18 months old. 
Jn 1984 Moussa, Adamu Jenitongo's elder 
son, worked as a tailor; his atelier was in his 
father's compound. But business was slack 

THE TASTE OF ETHNOGRAPHIC THINGS 415 
because the Jenitongo compound was far from 
rhe center of Till a beri. In 1985 he found a suit­
able atelier in Baghdad, a bustling section of 
Tillaberi. Moussa would leave his father's 
compound early in the morning, return for 
lunch, and leave again to complete the after­
noon tasks at his tailor shop. Since he soon 
had more work than he could handle himself, 
he hired an apprentice. 
By the time Stoller arrived in June of 1987, 
Moussa was spending much of his time at his 
tailor shop. He took his lunches there; for 
dinner, he sometimes ate small meals at the 
Baghdad bars: steak and french fries, green 
beans, omelettes. After Stoller's arrival, to 
fulfill the requirements of Songhay hospitalit y, 
Moussa made sure to return home to eat his 
meals. 
The quality of the sauces hadn't changed. 
Djebo did not serve fukko hoy, but on occa­
sion she refused to prepare meals, forcing 
Moussa, Stoller, and Adamu Jenitongo to eat 
meals of bread and sardines in soy oil. 
"Things are better now that you have 
come," Moussa told Stoller. "Weeks go by and 
she doesn't prepare meals. Baba is old; he 
needs to eat better, but she doesn't care. My 
brother Moru doesn't care. And Baba, he 
chews kola and tobacco ." 
"Bad sauces are better than no sauces," 
Stoller said. 
After one week of sauces the quality of 
which ranged from mediocre to bad, Stoller 
suffered a violent case of diarrhea. He quickly 
lost weight. Moussa suggested an alternative. 
"Let's eat our lunches with Madame. She is 
an excellent cook." Madame was the daugh­
ter of Adamu Jenitongo' s sister, Kedibo. 
Moussa and Stoller began to ear lunch at 
Madame' s house. The sauces were tasty: fine 
gombo, sesame, and squash sauces all of which 
were spiced delicately with permutations of 
garlic, ginger, locust bean, and hot pepper. 
Moussa and Stoller stuffed themselves, 
knowing that the evening fare would be much 
worse: tasteless rice paste drowned with 
watery tomato sauces all of which were spiced 
without imagination. There was millet in the 
compound, but Djebo refused to prepare it. 
When it became apparent that Stoller was 
taking his meals at Madame's house, Djebo protested. Jemma, Dje bo's mother-in-law , 
scowled. 
"Why do you insist on your European 
sauces?" Jemma asked him. "Why don't you 
eat the sauces we prepare for you?" 
Stoller did not respond directly; rather, he 
forced himself to eat two meals at lunch and 
one at dinner. Even with this increased con­
sumption, Stoller lost more weight. His diar­
rhea continued. 
Shamed by the bad sauces in his concession, 
Moussa confronted his younger brother Moru 
before an audience of visitors ro the 
compound. 
"'How can anyone live in this compound 
with your lazy wife, who, when she lowers 
herself to prepare food for us, produces sauces 
that our chickens won't eat." 
uNow hold on, older brother. How can you 
" 
"Shut up, you ignorant peasant. I feel like a 
stranger in my own home. Why return to a 
place where I'm nor wanted?" 
Moru wagged his forefinger ar Moussa. 
"You donkey. Worthless person. Come closer 
and insult my wife. I'll rear your eyes out. A 
man who doesn't even have a wife deserves to 
ear shit." 
"Better to be single than to be a slave to a 
bitch," Moussa retorted. "I'll ear my sauces 
elsewhere." 
Moru's wife and mother restrained him. 
Stoller restrained Moussa. 
Adamu Jenitongo called for peace. "We 
shame ourselves in front of strangers." 
Moru and Moussa are half-brothers. In the 
Songhay language they are bab'izey, which has 
two translations: "half-brothers" and "rivals." 
In Songhay bab'izey frequently have relation­
ships the major ingredient of which is jealousy 
and bad feelings built up over a lifetime. This 
problem has poisoned the relationships 
between Moru and Moussa. As men, they have 
very different kinds of temperaments. Moru is 
hot-headed and prone to verbal and even phys­
ical confrontation. Moussa is even-tempered 
and keeps his emotions more to himself. Moru 
is a musician who sometimes works as a 
laborer. Moussa is a tailor who works steadily. 
To add more salt to an open wound, both 

416 PAUL STOLLER AND CHERYL OLKES 
Moussa and Moru covet the powerful secrets 
of their father, one of the most powerful sor­
cerers (sohanci) in Niger. 
In his old age Sohanci Adamu Jenitongo 
hinted that he would pass on his secrets to 
both Moussa and Moru. But only one of them 
would receive his chain of power and his 
sacred rings. To Moru, }emma, and Djebo, the 
alliance of the younger son, it was painfully 
obvious that Adamu Jenitongo had chosen 
his eldest son Moussa to succeed him. Moussa 
had the relatively calm disposition required 
for receiving great power. Moussa also had 
powerful allies: Kedibo, Adamu Jenitongo's 
youngest sister, favored Moussa because 
Moussa's mother, Hadjo, was the sister of her 
late husband. Each time she visited her brother, 
Kedibo extolled the virtues of her "'nephew." 
Moussa' s steady disposition and his strate­
gic position in the family kinship network made Morn's situation hopeless. Being power­
less to change the course of events, Moru 
' 
Djebo, and }emma chose to make life miser-
able for Moussa, his mother Hadjo, and 
Adamu Jenitongo. As the recipient of power, 
Moussa would soon reap considerable social 
rewards. He would soon become the sohanci 
of Tillaberi; people would fear and respect 
him. Moru wanted the fear and respect that his 
older brother was soon to receive. Powerless 
, 
Moru, }emma, and Djebo used sauce to 
express their frustrations. Moussa must eat 
bad sauces and suffer in exchange for his good 
fortune. 
Sauce had again become the major ingredient 
in the stew of (Songhay) social relations, some­
thing which Montaigne had realized long 
before Djebo had produced her first {though 
certainly not her last) bowl of fukko hoy.
