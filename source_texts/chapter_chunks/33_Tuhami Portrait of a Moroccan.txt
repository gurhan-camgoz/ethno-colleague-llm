Tuhami: Portrait of 
a Moroccan 
Vincent Crapanzano 
There had been something desperate in 
Tuhami's last words: "Even my neighbors ask 
the same thing: why I don't get married. It irri­
tates me. It is up to Allah. There is nothing I 
can do about it." I knew that I could no longer 
maintain ethnographic distance. Tuhami's 
appeal was too great, and I myself too much 
of an activist, to accept what I understood then 
to be his passivity before forces externalized in 
'A'isha Qandisha, the saints, and ultimately 
Allah. I was a doer, and I came from a culture 
of doers - a culture that could accept as rea­
sonable the maxim "Nothing is impossible." I 
had learned this maxim as a child, and others 
like it ("Try, try, and try again; and if at first 
you don't succeed, try, try again"; "Don't give 
up the ship"; etc.). I had read modern versions 
of Horatio Alger and understood self-help 
and Nietzsche' s notion of self-overcoming. I 
was angered by Tuhami's passivity before 
the demonic, his fatalism, his submission to 
Allah's will, to what was "written." His 
beliefs, I was convinced at the moment, held 
him back; they hindered his self-expression 
and impeded hjs self-reliance; they precluded 
the possibility of self-overcoming. They were a 
sanctioned ground for rationalization. There 
was, I realized, a limit to my relativism. I 
became a curer. I was leaving in two weeks. I 
was anxious for Tuhami. My wife and I even 
talked about staying longer, but that was 
impossible. I write: "I became a curer." In fact, I had 
already become a curer. This is evident in my 
notes, and the reader is certainly aware of the 
way in which Tuhami and I both negotiated 
our exchange into a therapeutic one. Tuhami 
provided me (and I feel the consequence of this 
even now, as I write) with the possibility for 
maneuver, manipulation, and cure, with the 
occasion for a vicarious participation that was 
perhaps not so vicarious after all. (My own 
father died when I was young, though not so 
young as Tuhami had been.) And he provided 
me with the occasion for that romance of 
adventure and exploration that was, I imagine, 
what drew me, and continues to draw me to 
anthropology and field research. The moment 
I have cited as marking my change of status is 
for me one of those fatal instants that mark 
a moment in what has been recollected and 
will be repeated. Repetition and recollection, 
Kierkegaard ( 1964, p. 33) tells us, "are the 
same movement, only in opposite directions; 
for what is recollected has been, is repeated 
backwards, whereas repetition properly so 
called is recollected forwards.'' 
"Ethnographic distance" was a rhetorical 
device that enabled me both to mask my posi­
tion and to rationalize it. Certainly, as I look 
back over my meetings with Tuhami, it is clear 
that the "distance" between us-and the inten­
sity of our involvement -varied considerably , 
despite even the presence of Lhacen, my field

assistant. The methodological strategies of the 
fieldworker are, as George Devereux ( 1967) 
has observed, frequently the result of his anx­
ieties. Indeed, so, frequent ly, are his epistemo­
logical concerns. 
I had arrived in Morocco as a stranger with 
a determination to understand at least some 
small facet of the lives of the people that, 
for whatever reason, I found intriguing and 
somehow significant. I met many Moroccans 
whom I found uninteresting and unlikable, 
and I met some whom I found interesting and 
unlikable. I was also fortunate enough to meet 
a few who were both interesting and likable, 
and T uhami was among these. He was, within 
his terms, giving; and I, with an avaricious­
ness supported by my science, was willing to 
receive. I wanted to possess everything that 
T uhami knew and could tell me -and even 
more. I wanted to know him completely. I have 
always been fascinated by d'Annunzio's por­
trayal, in The Triumph of Death ( 1900), o.f 
hero and heroine's obsessive desire to know 
each other fully . The presumption that such 
knowledge can be achieved rests either on the 
belief in total sexual possession - a possession 
that ends up, as d'Annunzio understood, in 
total extinction -or on the reduction of the 
Other to that which is completely graspable: 
the specimen. The one, the goal of passion, and 
the other, the product of science, are not in fact 
so easily separable. Both are of course illusory. 
"The picture of another man that a man 
gains through personal contact with him," 
Georg Simmel observed in 1908, "is based on 
certain distortion s." 
These are not simple mistakes resulting from 
incomplete experience, defective vision, or 
sympathetic or anti-pathetic prejudices. They 
are fundamental changes in the quality of the 
actual object perceived. (Simmel, 1965 ed., 
p. 342) 
These qualitative distortions result, if I under­
stand Simmel correctly , from generalizations in 
some measure of the Other qua individual. 
In order to know a man, we see him not in 
terms of his pure individualit y, but carried, 
lifted up or lowered, by the general type under 
which we classify him. Even when this trans­
formation from the singular to the typical is 
so imperceptible that we cannot recognize it immediately; even when all the charactero­
logical concepts such as "moral" or 
"immoral," "free" or "unfree," "lordly" or 
"slavish" and so on, clearly appear inade­
quate, we privately persist in labeling a man 
according to an unverbaliz ed type, a type 
which does not coincide with his pure, indi­
vidual being. (Ibid., p. 343) 
These generalizations, which result from our 
fragmentary knowled ge of the Other , both 
detract and supplement his individual ity. The 
individual is, for Simmel, always in tension 
with the a priori, operative categories through 
which he is pictured. 1 These categories, or 
typifications, as we would call them today, 
include, ironically, the "singular individual." 
Although it might well appear that the appre­
hension of this singular individual should form 
the basis for correct relations with the Other, 
such an apprehension would itself be a distor­
tion of the individual as a social being. The 
very alterations and new formations that pre­
clude the ideal knowledge of the Other -the 
qualitative distortions-"are, actually, the con­
ditions which make possible the sort of rela­
tions we call social" (ibid., p. 345). "The 
individual is contained in sociation and, at the 
same time, finds himself confronted by it" 
(ibid., p. 350). 
I quote Simmel at some length here because, 
in his roughshod Kantian way, he struggled in 
his Introduction to Soziologie: Untersuchzm­
gen uber die Formen der Vergesel/schaftung 
with the problem of the knowled ge of the 
Other with a passion and a freshness that have 
been lost in later theories of labeling, typifica­
tion, and alienation. His argument, reformu­
lated in hermeneutical terms, is that we come 
to know another individual with a certain fore­
knowledge2 - a foreknowle dge that is sanc­
tioned by social convention (i.e., tradition), 
that fills in the "incompleteness" of that indi­
vidual's presentation, and that qualitatively 
modifies the individual as a subject of percep­
tion. Such knowledge, for Simmel, demands 
similarity, "because we cannot fully represent 
to ourselves an individuality which deviates 
from our own" (1965, p. 343). It also demands 
dissimilar ity, "in order to gain distance and 
objectivity." The knowledge of the Other 
requires, however paradoxica lly, both similar­
ity and dissimilarity: 

TUHAMI: PORTRAIT OF A MOROCCAN 457 
Nevertheless, perfect cognmon presupposes 
perfect identity. It seems, however, that every 
individual has in himself a core of individual­
ity which cannot be re-created by anybody 
else whose core differs from his own. And the 
challenge to re-create is logically incompatible 
with psychological distance and objective 
judgment, which are also bases for represent­
ing another. (Ibid., p. 343) 
Simmel is led to conclude: "We cannot know 
completely the individual ity of another." And 
this fact, however described, is, I believe, essen­
tial to the understanding of all social encoun­
ters. It is perhaps no accident that C. G. Jung 
(1961) concluded his autobiographical medita­
tion with a personal anagram that he left unex­
plained. It is also no accident that Simmel 
himself wrote about the lie and the secret. 
In most of our ordinary encounters, the 
assumptions of similarity and dissimilarity are 
accepted without question. It is only in the 
exceptional encounter that they come into 
question. And there are certain moments, but 
only certain moments, in the ethnographic 
encounter when they are indeed questioned. As 
I have written earlier, in most social encoun­
ters we assume that what a person says he 
experienced he did in fact experience; we 
assume that we can know another person, at 
least up to a certain point; and we assume the 
transparency of language. Such assumptions 
are, I believe, mystifications -at least from a 
strict epistemological point of view -that are 
necessary for social existence. We must assume 
knowledge not only of the Other as an exter­
nal actor - a soulless marionene -but as an 
experiencing individual with whom we are in 
as-sociation. We are rarely pushed, except in 
the height of romantic passion or in the bio­
graphical enterprise, to assume, or even to 
desire, as Simmel would put it, "perfect cog­
nition, of the Other. (To be sure, such perfect 
cognition occasionally becomes an ideal within 
those utopian movements that Victor Turner 
119741 has characterized as commwzitas, but 
such movements are for the most part charac­
terized by an extreme psychological na'ivete.) 
The push toward such cognition -fusion, 
really -is motivated, I suggest, by the fear of 
the very opposite -solipsistic miscognition or 
de-fusion -which the psychoanalyst would 
associate with separation. The ethnographer's entry into the field is 
always a separation from his world of primary 
reference -the world through which he 
obtains, and maintains, his sense of self and 
his sense of reality. He is suddenly confronted 
with the possibility of Otherness, and his 
immediate response to this Otherness is to 
seek both the security of the similar and the 
distance and objectivity of the dissimilar . No 
longer bound to the conventions of similarity 
and dissimilar ity that obtain within this own 
world of reference, he vacillates between an 
overemphasis on the similar or on the dissim­
ilar; at times, especially under stress, he freezes 
his relationship with -his understanding of -
this Otherness. He may become overly rigid, 
and his rigidity may determine the "texts" he 
elicits and the form he gives them. He may, in 
his anxiety, attempt to arrest time. Fortunately , 
the field experience is a lived experience that 
perdures, permitting a certain learning and 
requiring a flexibility that militates against this 
tendency to freeze both the relation with, and 
the understanding of, Otherness. Fortunately , 
too, most ethnographic encounters are, despite 
even the ethnographer , very human experi­
ences. The savage is, so to speak, less cowed 
by the ethnographer than the ethnographer is 
by the savage. 
I came to Morocco with an a ware ness of 
Otherness. I had been there briefly as a tourist 
several years before 1 began my field study, and 
I had lived in several other societies that were, 
in their own ways, more alien to me than 
Morocco. I did not meet Tuhami until I had 
been in Meknes for several weeks. He did not 
immediately threaten my taken-for-granted 
world. I had already been shocked on more 
than one occasion into questioning that world. 
(The most dramatic but hardly the most sig­
nificant example was the first rime I saw a 
Hamdushi slash his head until he was 
drenched with blood; the more significant 
examples were far less dramatic and in their 
own right hardly memorable: e.g., eating in 
restaurants in which there were never any 
women, waiting for hours for a new and 
casual acquaint ance to feed me an enormous 
meal). I had reached a moment of flexible 
accommodation with my new Moroccan 
reality when I first met Tuhami. I could get 
along. 

458 VINCENT CRAPANZANO 
Such moments of flexible accommodation 
punctuate the field experience. If there are no 
conventions for describing encounters between 
two or more persons, they are quickly negoti­
ated, but in a very specific and superficial 
manner. They are determined by the most 
essential matters on hand. With time, however, 
one's relations deepen and become more 
complex; they demand new accommodations 
-and new conventions. As Paul Rabinow 
observed with respect to his Moroccan infor­
mant Ali: 
there began to emerge a mutually constructed 
ground of experience and understanding, a 
realm of tenuous common sense which was 
constantly breaking down, being patched up, 
and re-examined, first here, then there. 
(Rabinow 1977, p. 39) 
fieldwork must be understood within its 
temporal dimension as a process of continual 
discovery and self-discovery. There is con­
siderable truth in Paul Ricoeur's involuted 
definition -quoted by Rabinow (1977) -of 
the hermeneutic as ''the comprehension of self 
by the detours of the comprehension of the 
other." There is also a value, coordinate with 
tact and respect for the other, in pushing the 
swing of comprehension back to the other. 
There is no doubt that I learned much about 
myself and my world through the detour of 
my comprehension of Tuhami. Some of this I 
have thought relevant to my study, and I have 
attempted to convey it explicitly or implicitly. 
Some of it I find irrelevant - and even irrever­
ent to Tuhami -and I have tried to omit it. I 
am not, after all, engaged in autobiography , 
except in the most tenuous sense. I am cer­
tainly not interested in confession and expia­
tion, though both confession and expiation 
enter inevitably into my enterprise. 
As I look back over my notes, and as I 
attempt to recall my meetings with Tuhami 
some ten years ago, I am immediat ely struck 
by the impoverished quality of my emotional 
response. My questions seem frequently cold, 
unemotional, and detached. Was I frozen 
before Tuhami? In part, the question must be 
answered in the affirmative. There were times 
when my relations with Tuhami specifically or 
with Morocco and the Hamadsha more gen­
erally - the two cannot easily be distinguished -were such that I could not permit myself any 
response but the most distant. It was at such 
times that I took refuge in my difficulties with 
Arabic and exploited, I suppose, the presence 
of Lhacen. It was at such times, too, that 
I made use of "ethnographic distance" and 
various theoretical positions, most notably the 
psychoanalytic but others as well, to distance 
myself and to defend myself from an onslaught 
of presumably intolerable emotions. (I should 
add here that Tuhami took refuge at times in 
Lhacen's presence, in "ethnographic distance" 
as he understood it, and, undoubtedly, in his 
own theoretical understanding of what was 
transpiring.) 
Even today, as I write, such defensive 
maneuvers, in more attenuated form, I believe, 
come into play. Indeed, at some level, my lit­
erary enterprise must be conceived in such 
terms. I have difficulty, both stylistically and 
psychological ly, in distinguishing the time of 
encounter from the time of writing. For 
Tuhami, I have my notes; for myself, I have 
only my memory. I do not know when my 
theoretical confabulations, my observations 
and explications, result immediately from the 
encounter and when they result from the liter­
ary reencounter . I note, for example, that I 
have tended to overinterpret Tuhami's words 
in the first pages of his portrait. Is this a result 
simply of the need to introduce the reader to 
Tuhami and his culture and to explain my own 
theoretical orientation? Or am I repeating the 
over-interpretation that comes in the first 
months of fieldwork? Am I, in other words, 
recreating a past response or responding anew 
to an encounter? 
The ethnographic encounter , like any 
encounter, however distorted in its immediacy 
or through time, never ends. It continually 
demands interpretation and accommodation. 
The ethnograp hy, as I have written elsewhere 
(Crapanzano 1977b), is an attempt to put a 
full stop to an encounter that is necessarily 
disorienting. The same may be said of the 
portrait, the case history, the life history, the 
biography , and even the autobiography. In 
their own ways they all demand a cessation of 
time - a complete departure from the 
encounter. The sadness, the guilt, the feelings 
of solitude, and the love that come with depar­
ture and death will not, cannot, end. Tuhami 

TUHAMI: PORTRAIT OF A MOROCCAN 459 
has come to embody these feelings for me, 
much, I think, as the demons that haunted him 
embodied similar feelings for him. 
There was always something captivating 
about Tuhami's discourse. It was as though he 
wanted to entrap me, to enslave me through 
the power of the word in an intricate web of 
fantasy and reality -to reverse, if you will, the 
colonial relationship that I as a foreigner , a 
nasrani, must have suggested to him. There 
was something seductive in his discourse, too. 
He did not in fact want me or anyone else. 
That would have been too immediate, too bur­
densome, too demanding for him. What he 
wanted, I have come to believe, was rather the 
imaginary fulfillment of an emptiness, a lack, 
a manque-a-etre, to use jacques Lacan's (1966) 
phrase, that he suffered. I became, I imagine, 
an articulatory pivot about which he could 
spin out his fantasies in order to create him­
self as he desired. I was created to create him, 
to fill metaphorically the emptiness that 
his desire, in its perversit y, desired. Tuhami 
wanted fulfillment through the metaphor 
without denying the essentially irreal quality of 
the metaphor. Anything more concrete would 
have been too dangerously real. 
As for me, I was soon captivated and 
seduced by Tuhami's evocations. I now see 
signs of captivation and seduction in my very 
first meeting with him. I guarded myself with 
the devices offered by my science and with a 
certain forced naivete. I would return from my 
sessions with Tuhami filled with the joy of dis­
covery and eagerly describe them to my wife. 3 
We were fascinated and pleased with the con­
stant deepening of our awareness of Morocco 
that came through Tuhami and many of my 
other informants. I pushed ever deeper, some­
times without the restraint that is required in 
such encounters. (Lhacen frequently corrected 
my haste with his sure sense of tact and his 
indomitable patience; he too was excited by 
our discoveries.) Tuhami was, at the beginning 
and occasionally at other times during our 
meetings, potentially graspable. All that was 
required was time. His distance from me, his 
dissimilar ity, made him into a specimen. But I 
soon felt very uneasy in this attitude. My con­
versations with my wife soon shifted from fas­
cination and joy to concern and worry. We 
were coming to know Tuhami as a person and beginning not only to sympathize with his con­
dition but to empathize with him. Care had 
entered our relationship. 
A confident empathy is not readily forth­
coming in fieldwork. The fieldworker is often 
overwhelmed by dissimilar ity; he is too distant 
and too objective. To experience the Other as 
a subject through the full range of his emotions, 
Sartre (1956) observes, is not an act of passive 
cognition. It is an active granting of importance 
-importance for oneself-to the Other's sub­
jectivity. The Other must matter in one's own 
self-constitution; he must not simply be an 
object of scientific or quasi-scientific scrutiny. 
To understand the Other , the ethnographer 
must come to participate as best he can in the 
Other's reality. Aside from the usual difficulties 
that come with entering into an alien cultural 
tradition, the ethnographer is caught within a 
dilemma of intentionality that has come to be 
described by the oxymoron "participant obser­
vation'' (Rabinow 1977). On the one hand, the 
ethnographer must engage in the life of the 
people he studies; he must enter into their 
intentiona lly determined world-the world of 
their praxis; and he must permit himself 
somehow only the self-reflection necessitated 
by their (and his) particular praxis. (I assume 
here that all intentional activities both demand 
and delimit self-refle ction.) On the other hand, 
the fieldworker must remain faithful to his 
own primary intention: to do research. He 
must be able to remove himself from the life of 
the people he studies; he must remain outside 
their intentionally determined world; and he 
must permit himself a self-reflection that is 
demanded and delimited by his own particular 
praxis, his research. 
The instant that mark ed the change in my 
relationship with Tuhami reflects, I believe, my 
own inability to maintain, or to pretend to 
maintain, these two distinct intentionalities. 
Tuhami had come to matter to me. My science 
and even the presence of Lhacen were no 
longer sufficient to distance me from him. His 
dissimilarity had fallen away to reveal his sim­
ilarity. (Or perhaps I had discovered in his dis­
similarity a similarit y, though I do not think 
this was the case at the time.) And I believe I 
had come to matter for him. I see evidence of 
this not only in his response to me and to 
Lhacen -and Lhacen's to me, for that matter 

460 VINCENT CRAPANZANO 
-but in several of Tuhami's dreams that I 
report in the next part of this book. Unfortu· 
nately, I have no exact record of my own 
dreams. I do remember , rather vaguely, a 
dream fragment I had, either toward the end 
of my stay in Morocco or several seeks later in 
Paris. I was watching Tuhami, from the 
outside� sitting cross-l egged in the courtyard of 
a saint's tomb. The tomb itself was brilliantly 
white. He was wearing very bright blue pants 
and was swaying back and forth in meditation 
-oblivious of me. Then (a secondary elabora· 
tion, I believe) he looked up and smiled at me.� 
This change precluded, at least at the time, 
the maintenance of a double intentionalit y. I 
had to respond to T uhami in the immediacy of 
our relationship. I was relieved, and so was 
Lhacen, who, despite his sophistication, must 
have been puzzled by the very strange trans· 
actions I had initiated. He began to reiterate 
the advice I was giving to Tuhami. I was 
nervous and at times stiff in my new role, less 
because of its newness than because of my 
imminent departure. 
Tuhami was relieved, too. He yielded to me. 
He came to speak my language -the language 
of the '"real'' rather than the .. imaginar y," 
however sanctioned it was by his traditional 
idiom. I was unable at the time to recognize 
the putative quality of the real; I did not under­
stand that the "'real" as well as the .. imagi­
nary" can serve a metaphorical function. The 
colonial relationship was restored. I was secure 
and could rationalize my position as protector· 
therapist. Tuhami accepted this reversal with 
ease, nor simply because it is always easier to 
return to old ways. especially when depen­
dency is involved, but because he could at last 
understand our relationship. Although my 
ways were mysterious to him, their mystery 
itself was familiar. The ways of the Moroccan 
curer, like the ways of all curers, are always 
mysterious. 5 
I have been writing largely as though 
Tuhami and I were conversing alone. I have 
ignored Lhacen. In Part One I wrote: 
As a Moroccan and yet a stranger ro Meknes, 
and as a Berber, Lhacen provided, I believe, a 
"familiar distance" that was necessary for 
the frankness of our discourse. Had he not 
been there, our relationship would have been awkward. Present, he could be ignored and 
was ignored. 
Masked here by a rhetorical flourish is a 
significant contradiction. How could Lhacen 
both free the relationship between Tuhami and 
me of its awkwar dness and yet be ignored? To 
consider this contradiction -and it must be 
considered -is to consider the role of the Third 
in any relations hip. Lhacen's presence raises 
the question of the use of a field assistant or 
an interpreter in anthropological research. 
In my fieldwork I have worked both alone 
and with a field assistant. I have found that 
there is a qualitative difference in the material 
obtained in the two situations. Contrary to 
what I would have expected on theoretical 
grounds, I have found that the material I col­
lected with a field assistant, at least in the 
initial phases of research, had an intimacy of 
tone and detail that I did not obtain when I 
worked alone. 
Lhacen -and the field assistant more gen­
erally -served to mediate the relationship 
between Tuhami and me in a very complex 
manner. He and I were both strangers -to 
Meknes, to Tuhami, and to each other. I was 
a stranger to Morocco as well. We shared, in 
our relationship with Tuhami, that "unity of 
nearness and remoteness" that Simmel ( 1964a) 
finds in the ''phenomenon of the stranger." In 
relationship with the stranger, "distance means 
that he, who is close by, is far, and strangeness 
means that he, who is also far, is actually near" 
(Simmel 1964a, p. 402). As strangers we 
shared a kind of objectivity (see Schutz 1944; 
Nash 1963), a detachment even, that was 
rationalized in my case by my science and in 
Lhacen's case perhaps by the "job" he was per­
forming for me. We shared a common inten­
tion: to learn as much as we could about the 
Hamadsha and about the people, like Tuhami, 
around them. In different ways, we were both 
entrapped in the formulations of that inten­
tion. The most significant of these, and for me, 
at least, the most personally distasteful, was 
the formulation -the creation -of the infor­
mant, whom I frequently confused, and still 
confuse in my reveries, with the "informer. "6 
Lhacen told me after meeting Tuhami for the 
first time that he had discovered "un infor· 
mateur formidable." 1 was excited by the 

TUHAMI: PORTRAIT OF A MOROCCAN 461 
prospect, but now, in retrospect, I am troubled 
by it. Tuhami, Moroccans more generally , and 
the Hamadsha had become for Lhacen, as 
well as for me, informant s-to-be-discovered !· 
Lhacen and I had talked for many hours about 
Morocco, the Hamadsha, ourselves, and about 
my research aims and strategies. We had 
visited many sanctuaries and brotherhoods 
throughout Morocco before finally deciding 
on the Hamadsha in and around Meknes. We 
had rehearsed, so to speak, "our" research. We 
accommodated ourselves to it, to each other, 
and to the people, now potential informants, 
with whom we were ro work. We became 
friends; but in differing ways and for different 
reasons we cast the eye of a stranger on our 
relationship to each other. Lhacen was for me 
always a Moroccan, an informant-privileged 
to be sure -in his own right. I was his 
employet, who offered him not only a liveli­
hood bur the opportunity to acquire knowl­
edge that could be of potential benefit to him. 
Lhacen and I were strangers in very differ­
ent ways. I was an American, a nasrani, a 
speaker of French -the language of the colon 
-a man of letters. Lhacen was a Berber from 
Marrakech, originally from an isolated village 
high in the Atlas Mountains, a sheri(, a 
member of a holy and venerable lineage, a 
Morocca n. My roots, the milieu from which I 
drew my personal sustenance, as the Moroc­
cans might say (Rosen 1972), were distant, in 
Europe and America. There, in the space that 
was "magically" construed for Tuhami and 
others in his milieu, was the locus of my iden­
tity, the ground of my meaningful world, my 
most significant social horizon, the place 
·where my friends and family dwelt, the center 
of my ambition, and the privileged arena of my 
concern. Lhacen's roots, his identity, his mean­
ingful world, his social horizon, his friends and 
family, his ambition, and his concern, were 
in Morocco. He was bound in that "chain of 
consociation" that characterizes Moroccan 
social life (Rosen 1972a, band above, p. 77). 
He was a participant in a society that, as 
Clifford Geertz argues (somewhat too rhetor­
ically), "does not cope with its diversity by 
sealing it into castes, isolating it into tribes, 
dividing it into ethnic groups, or covering it 
over with some common denominator con­
cept of nationalit y ... (Geertz 1975, p. 52)." Lhacen could be incorporated into Tuhami's 
world, could be classified and understood, in 
a way that I could never be. Lhacen did not 
possess the privilege of departure that I did. 
Most Moroccans I met-but, significantly, not 
Tuhami -were, I suspect, far more envious of 
my car and my passport than of my other 
material possessions. 
Lhacen 's role in the exchanges between 
Tuhami and me varied over time. At first it was 
active. It was Lhacen who discover ed Tuhami 
and introduced him to me. Tuhami was 
for Lhacen a "find" that could help seal 
his relationship with me (by attesting to his 
seriousness, his unique capacities, and his 
understanding of my needs) and affirm my 
dependency on him. (Lhacen and I often 
talked, after those first meetings with Tuhami, 
about Tuhami's potential as an informant.) 
Lhacen was also able to demonstrate his 
importance to Tuhami. Not only was he famil­
iar with the ways and language of the nasram 
-and this familiarity was so important to him 
that he assumed its importance for others-but 
he was also able to provide Tuhami with an 
additional income. I paid Tuhami, as I paid all 
the Moroccans who took time from their own 
work to help me. This was expected, and they 
never bickered or argued or vied with one 
another for my favor; certainly, Tuhami did 
not. Payment gave some of them an "under­
standing" of my demands. They had a job. 
Tuhami refused this "understanding." He 
never spoke directly about the money I gave 
him except when he lost a portion of it and 
told me he was saving it for his first iallaba (see 
below). Usually, and despite its evident impor­
tance for him, he accepted the money with 
seeming indifference. 
In those first meetings, Lhacen mediated my 
relationship with Tuhami. 1 was still new to 
Morocco. I was caught in the whirl of the 
unfamiliar. I was without anchor and did not 
have the confidence that comes with knowing 
the rules of social comportment and cultural 
evaluation. I was determined not to succumb 
to the easy aloofness of the total stranger. I felt 
awkward, confused, lonely even in the pres­
ence of my wife, and occasionally afraid. 1 was 
terrified of failure and of everything that 
failure symbolized for me, and I gave expres­
sion to this terror, most notably in terms of a 

462 VINCENT CRAPANZANO 
loss of rapport with the best of my informants. 
Tuhami was among them, and the sway of my 
terror and its idiosyncratic expression are 
evident in my entretiens with him. I clung, in 
those first encounters with Tuhami, not only 
to a rigid and rather banal conception of my 
task but to Lhacen as well. He gave me dis­
tance and protected me from direct and imme­
diate contact and from the fears and pleasures 
of such contact. Lhacen was less of a stranger 
than Tuhami. I imagine that Lhacen served a 
similar role for Tuhami. He did not, at any 
rate, get in the way. 
Lhacen, and other assistants in Morocco and 
elsewhere, also gave me access to the more 
immediate and, as I have said, more intimate 
world of my informants and friends. It was 
not they who had to give me access. Through 
Lhacen I had already had my "introduction" 
to Morocco. They did not have to feed me 
those representations of culture and society, 
those cliches, by which the members of any · 
group present themselves to, and defend them­
selves against, the stranger. (These representa­
tions frequently become the stuff of superficial 
ethnographic description and bolster the 
stranger's stereotypic view of an alien people.) 
Rather, Lhacen's presence, and his and there­
fore my putative savvy, permitted a more direct 
entree into the lived world of the Moroccans 
with whom we worked. Their reflections were 
not determined by the presence of a "total 
stranger. "7 My informants were deprived to 
some extent of a protective shield, or, perhaps 
more accurately, they were given, through 
Lhacen, a new shield. The defenses they did 
have had to be respected or else overcome 
through time and warmth and concern. 
I am pointing here to certain structural 
factors in the use of an assistant that may facil­
itate certain types of research. (Among others 
would be the slowed rhythm of the meetings, 
the possibility of observing often illuminating 
distortions within the translations, the ability 
to deflect responsibility for questions and mis­
understandings to a Third, and the opportu­
nity to discuss the meetings afterwards -an 
opportunity with obvious implications for the 
meetings themselves .) Certainly, my relation­
ship with Lhacen and Tuhami was unique. As 
I remarked earlier, Lhacen had an almost 
uncanny ability to efface hjmself in our encounters -an effacing that, paradoxically , 
did not preclude his active participation as an 
interpreter and, later as an interpreter-obser ver 
in these encounters.8 (Self-effacement does not 
necessarily or even usually come with silence 
and feigned invisibility. It requires, I believe, 
the quality that Heidegger [ 1971] finds char­
acteristic of "equipment" [das Zeug] in his 
famous analysis of Van Gogh's paintings of 
peasant shoes: Verla{Siichkeit, reliability. In the 
picture, one's attention is called to the shoes 
and all they evoke; in fact, the peasant "simply 
wears them." This reliability "first gives to the 
simple world its security and assures to the 
earth the freedom of its steady thrust.") We 
were both strangers and, as such, encouraged 
openness. The stranger, Simmel ( 1964a) noted, 
"often receives the most surprising openness -
confidences which sometimes have the charac­
ter of a confessional and which would be 
carefully withheld from a more closely related 
person." However this may be, a certain 
warmth and sympathy, an approach ability, 
is requisite for such openness even among 
strangers. Lhacen possessed this, and I believe 
that I did, at least when I was not frozen in 
myself. Both of us remarked on the innumer­
able confidences we had received, over the 
years, from total strangers. 
With rime, Lhacen 's role in the meetings 
changed. Tuhami and I recognized our impor­
tance for each other.9 It was we who were 
meeting. We nevertheless needed Lhacen. We 
could not go on without him, but in our 
diverse ways we bracketed him off (never com­
pletely, however , for his presence was neces­
sary to our relationship). He was, for Tuhami 
and me, the Third, who rendered us, in Sartre's 
(1964) words, an us-object. 
Thus what I experience is a being-outside in 
which I am organized with the Other in an 
indissoluble, objective whole, a whole in 
which I am fundament ally no longer distinct 
from the Other but which I agree in solidar­
ity with the Other to constitute. (Sartre 1964, 
p. 418) 
The essentially conflictual nature of the dual 
relationship, in Sartre's understanding and in 
Hegel's and Simmel's too, is, at least for the 
moment, arrested. Through the Third, embod­
ied here in Lhacen, Tuhami's and my possibil-

TUHAMI: PORTRAIT OF A MOROCCAN 463 
ities become 64dead possibilities": "But as soon 
as the Third appears, the Other's possibilit ies 
and my own are leveled into dead possibilit ies, 
and hence the relationship becomes recipro­
cal" (Sartre 1964, p. 418}. 
There is, as Sartre brilliantly portrays in No 
Exit (1945), a fundamental instability in any 
triadic relationship. There is a constant shift­
ing of alliances and objectifying gazes. These, 
of course, were all at play in the meetings 
between Tuhami, Lhacen, and me; but after 
the first meetings, where Lhacen played an 
active role, they tended to be subsumed under 
an intentionally validated, an ad hoc conven­
tional, frame that we had negotiated and now 
accepted. The meetings were between T uhami 
and me. Lhacen was a kind of spokesman for 
one and then the other of us; that is, he was 
identified seriatim with each of us as we 
addressed the other. 
It is precisely the conventionally validated 
frames, ignored by Sartre in Being and Noth­
ingness and No Exit, that permit a certain 
(symbolic) constancy in our triadic relations. 
· Within the established frame, Lhacen was 
able to mediate those minor conflicts, those 
"insignificant differences of opinion, the allu­
sions to an antagonism of personalities, the 
emergence of quite momentary contrasts of 
interest and feeling," that continually color, as 
Simmel (1964b) notes, even the least signifi­
cant conversations and that certainly colored 
my conversations with Tuhami. 
Such mediations do not even have to be per­
formed by means of words. A gesture, a way 
of listening, the mood that radiates from a 
particular person, are enough to change the 
difference between two individuals so that 
they can seek understanding, are enough to 
make them feel their essential commonness 
which is concealed under their acutely differ­
ing opinions, and to bring this divergence into 
the shape in which it can be ironed out the 
most easily. (Simmel 1964b, p. 149) 
It is the difference between the frame and the 
action within the frame that permitted me to 
assert, and permits me to reassert, the contra­
dictory observation with which I began this 
discussion of Lhacen's role in my encounter 
wirh Tuhami. "Had he not been there, our 
relationship would have been awkward. Present, he could be ignored and was 
ignored." 
The complicity to bracket off Lhacen - a 
complicity that the three of us entered into 
from our different standpoints -not only 
permitted the conventional framing of our 
encounter and the maneuvers that occurred 
within it; it also enabled us to invest Lhacen 
with symbolic significance. He came to repre­
sent the constancy of the frame. Indeed, he 
became for me, and for Tuhami roo, I believe, 
a symbol of constancy and continuit y in a dis­
course that was threatened with interruption 
through both fantasied departur es (Tuhami's 
announced intention to make a trip) and my 
inevitable departure. The fact of departure, 
which has been largely ignored in the anthro­
pological discussions of fieldwork, plays a 
determining role in all field research.w The 
anthropologist as stranger -the wanderer who 
comes and leaves-is nor the stranger of whom 
Simmel ( 1964a) writes. His stranger comes to 
stay. The inevitability of my departure, under­
stood at the outset and ignored thereafter, was 
reflected not only in the rhythm of my entre­
liens with Tuhami and Lhacen's role tn them 
but also in the recurrent themes of separa­
tion, death, castration, and abandonment that 
punctuat ed these inrerviews. 11 
Lhacen himself played out his symbolic role 
in mediating conflict. He thus freed Tuhami 
and me of the burden of constancy and conti­
nuity and the fear of death and departure and 
allowed us the indulgence of symbolic attribu­
tion, of transference and countertransference. 
As controller of the word (and he struggled 
hard with our words and resented, I thought, 
my increasing knowledge of Arabic), he came 
to embody, quite literally, the transcendental 
Other, that "seat of the Word and guarantor 
of Truth," which, if I understand La can ( 1966) 
correcrly, is necessary to intersubjective com­
munication (Crapanzano 1978). (lacan, pace 
Lacan, can be read as a gloss not only on Freud 
but on Sartre as well.) Lhacen occupied, to 
speak figuratively , the place of God - in 
Sartre's terms, the place of the unrealized 
Third -within the little universe we three 
created.11 
I exaggerate of course -to point out an 
irony. We assume that Lhacen played a note­
worthy role - a role that governed the 

464 VINCENT CRAPANZANO 
exchange between Tuhami and me. He did. Of 
this there can be no question. Yet I must rec­
ognize here a certain "empirical" bias. Pos­
sessed of body, Lhacen could embody for me, 
and perhaps for my readers, highly abstract 
symbolic meanings. Are Tuhami's demons -
who are bodiless, at least as I understand 
"body" -thus incapable of such "embo­
diments"? Is it not possible that 'A'isha Qan­
disha, and the other jnun that haunted 
Tuhami's life, represented the Third, the tran­
scendental locus of meaning, the constancy 
and continuity of our relationship, of any rela­
tionship he had? (I have argued elsewhere 
[1977a] that possessing spirits provide the pos­
sessed with a frozen identity by arresting the 
dialectics of identity formation.) Or perhaps 
these spirits render the relationship consider­
ably more complex than I have described 
it here. I remember working with other 
Moroccans who, for whatever reasons, sud­
denly became aware of (we might say, "were · 
spooked by") a demonic presence. My inter­
views then came to a dead halt. I am not 
proposing here a mysticism or a philosophy of 
excessive idealism. I am simply calling atten­
tion to a possibility of Otherness that I do not 
even claim to be Tuhami's. It must be enter­
tained though. 
There is, at least for me, an elegiac quality 
in my re-creation of Tuhami. I recognize, as I 
write now, the contingency of our existence. 
How did it come to pass that I, an American 
anthropologist, should have met Tuhami, a 
Moroccan tilemaker , and entered so deeply 
into his life and allowed him to enter so deeply into my own? I write of him now with the hope 
that something of what I learned from him will 
serve to correct our own mechanistic pre­
sumptions about the nature of man and his 
relations to his fellow beings. I have placed my 
personal encounter within an abstract theoret­
ical edifice - a consequence of my encounter -
that is neither fully consistent nor as illumi­
nating as I should have liked it to be in order 
to call attention to these presumptions. With 
the same end in mind I have played with style 
and form, and I am satisfied with neither. I 
have forced myself into the theoretical position 
that we can know the experience of another 
only by what he says (as though a text can be 
understood without the assumption of inter­
subjectivity), and, at the same time, I have 
made a plea for a more immediate intersub­
jective understanding, which I take to be 
. necessary in any social encounter . This para­
dox, masked in most ordinary, conventional 
encounters, is brought to light in the ethno­
graphic encounter and may well be its hall­
mark. "It probably requires cultural insiders," 
James Clifford ( 1978) speculates, "to recog­
nize adequately the subtle ruses of individual­
ity where outsiders see only typical beha vior." 
I do not know. Our individua lity, Simmel 
(1965, p. 344) noted, in the same essay I have 
been quoting, "is supplemented by the Other's 
view of us, which results in something that we 
never are purely and wholly." The same must 
be said for the Other, for Tuhami, in his sub­
jectivity. We should respect in the Other the 
same mystery we expect others to respect in 
ourselves. This too is a social fact.
