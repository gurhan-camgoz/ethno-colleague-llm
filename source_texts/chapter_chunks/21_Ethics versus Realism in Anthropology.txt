Ethics versus ''Realism'' in 
Anthropology 
Gerald D. Berreman 
Introduction 
At the annual meeting of the American 
Anthropological Association in December 
1985, I participated as a representative of the 
Association's Committee on Ethics (COE) 
during the era in which its Principles of Pro­
fessional Responsibility (PPR) -the official 
euphemism for our code of ethics -was 
drafted and adopted: 1969 to 1971. The situ­
ation at the time of that meeting was that a 
new, draft Code of Ethics (dCoE) had been 
placed before the membership in the October 
1984 edition of the Anthropology Newsletter, 
fundamenta lly redefining and reformulating 
the concepts of ethics and responsibility in the 
profession to accord with what its authors said 
were the changed circumstances of the time. 
Discussion of the draft code was invited in the 
columns of the Newsletter and in an open 
forum, which had been held for the purpose 
at the 1984 annual meeting, with the goal of 
rcvismg it and bringing it to a vote in the fall 
of 1985. If adopted it was to supersede the 
PPR or, if a vote were to appear premature at 
that time, further discussion was to be sched­
uled before holding the vote. The latter course 
was followed (including the 1985 sess1on, "Ethics, Professionalism and the Future of 
Anthropolo gy," and a follow-up session at the 
1986 meetings ). My role in each was to put 
the draft code into historical context and give 
my response to it. This chapter is based on 
those two presentations. The vote, inciden­
tally, was never held. 
I will introduce the context for what I have 
to say simply by asserting that I believe 
humane ethics in research and scholarship to 
be practical necessities for anthropologists 
today, just as human rights and self-interest ­
social justice and survival - have become 
inseparable for people everywhere (Berreman 
1980:12; cf. 1971c:398-9). Therefore, when J 
speak of ethics versus realism in anthropolo gy 
I am not referring to the "consum mate 
realism" that Ernest Becker called "instru­
mental utopianism" (1971:xi), and that both 
he and C. Wright Mills before hi.m advocated: 
the forthright application of reason to the solu­
tion of human problems. Rather, the "realism" 
I contrast ironically with ethics is that referred 
to by Mills (1963:402) as the boast of "crack­
pot realists," whom Becker called "hard­
headed realists," that is, "the militarists and 
other bureaucrats ... [with] their age-old 
practical nightmares" (Becker 1971 :xi). That

ETHICS VERSUS "REALISM" IN ANTHROPOLOGY 299 
said, let me proceed to some historical back­
ground for the issues of ethics and "realism" 
in anthropology today. 
History: Anthropology and 
Ethics, 1919 to 1986 
The first ethical issue to discernibly attract the 
attention of the American Anthropological 
Association was the brief and tragicomical 
imbroglio of 1919 to 1920, wherein Franz 
Boas, founder of our discipline in America, 
became the only member of the association 
ever to be censured and expelled (Stocking 
1968:2 73 ). His offense was that he reported 
in The Nation "incontrovertible proof," which 
had "accidentally" come his way, that "at least 
four" anthropologists had served as spies 
under 'cover of scholarly research during 
World War I (Boas 1919:729; see also AAA 
1920:93-4). 
The first serious systematic concern with 
. ethics as such in our profession came about 
thirty years later, after World War II, when in 
1948 the association adopted the "Resolution 
of Freedom of Publication," urging "all spon­
soring institutions to guarantee their research 
scientists complete freedom to interpret and 
publish their findings without censorship or 
interference, provided that the interests of 
!those] studied are protected'' (AAA 1949: 
370).1 (That resolution should be borne in 
mind, I think, as we consider the provisions of 
the draft code.) But it took the infamous and 
ill-fated Project Camelot, an American coun­
terinsurgency research plan for Chile in 1965 
-more than fifteen years after the research 
freedom resoluti on -to focus anthropological 
attention squarely on the issues of ethics and 
secrecy in research (Horowitz 1967). It was in 
response to this that the Beals Commit tee was 
appointed by the Executive Board of the AAA 
in 1967, which then produced the ground­
breaking report entitled "Background Infor­
mation on Problems of Anthropological 
Research and Ethics" (Beals et al. 1967:2-13). 
As a result of this report, the membership of 
the AAA voted adoption, in March 1967, of 
the "Statement of Problems of Anthropologi­
cal Research and Ethics," based on that report. 
It is still in effect and is part of the packet of materials entitled Professional Ethics ( 1983 ), 
that is available from the Executive Office of 
the American Anthropological Association. It 
comprises essentially a draft code of ethics for 
the association and is a forerunn er, both in 
time and content, of the Principles of Profes­
sional Responsi bility. 
At this point in the history of these matters, 
we move into what for many members of the 
association were the glory days (or the gory 
days, depending upon one's social and politi­
cal viewpoint) of the late 1960s and early 
1970s. The virtuous and the villainous were 
unambiguously defined no matter which side 
one was on, with few who were neutral or 
undecided. To say that is nor to belitde the 
struggle or its importance. It was the good 
fight and the stakes were high. University and 
college departments were politically and ethi­
cally split (my own, for one), as was the pro­
fession. Friendships were severed, even as 
others were forged that would be strong and 
everlasting; enemies were made, respect was 
won and lost, principles were upheld and 
betrayed. The association was riven. The 
turmoil was perhaps most vividly displayed 
during and following the presidential election 
of 1970, wherein I, a member of the Commit­
tee on Ethics (which had confronted the Exec­
utive Board on issues surrounding the PPR and 
the ethics of anthropologists' involvement in 
mission-oriented activities in Southeast Asia, 
notably Thailand), was nomina ted as a presi­
dential candidat e. It was the first time that a 
nomjnation for association office had come 
from the electorate, as provided in the consti­
tution, in addition to those candida tes pro­
vided by the Committee on Nominations 
(three in the case of the presidency; Newslet­
ter, 1970d: 1 ). Shortly before the election, two 
of the three nominees of the committee with­
drew their candidacies in favor of the third, 
considered the strongest of the three, in order 
to make it a two-person contest ''because of 
the serious issues confronting the association 
and the introduction of a new nominee'' 
(Newsletter, 1970e: 1 ). The tactic evidently 
worked, as the committee's remaining candi­
date, Anthony Wallace, won by a margin of 
about two to one, although there is, of course, 
no way to know what might have been the 
outcome had all four candidates fulfilled the 

300 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
agreement upon which their acceptance of 
nomination was constitutionally predicated: 
that they would run and would serve if elected 
(Newsletter, 1971:1).1 
In any case, in an effort to heal the wounds 
of these divisive events, at the annual meeting 
I was asked by the president, George Foster, 
to give a brief address to the council in my role 
as the defeated candidate and presumed 
spokesperson for the dissident minority. In 
view of the then-recent abolition of the presi­
dential address, mine was the only address 
delivered before the council that year, an 
unusual parliamentary event, to say the least, 
and an opportunity I could hardly decline 
(Berreman 1971a; 1971b). I doubt that my 
talk did much to realize the hopes which moti­
vated the request that I speak, but though it 
viewed the future of the association through 
what proved to have been a rather clouded 
crystal ball, it did gratify those who had sup- . 
ported my nomination for the values it repre­
sented. The tensions, disagreements, and 
divisions that surfaced in those days have 
diminished only slowly and uncertainly at best. 
The continuing controversy over the PPR, and 
the possibility of its replacement by the dCoE, 
are manifestations of that schism, and the heat 
of the continuing arguments reflects that of the 
Vietnam era, with some of the same cast of 
characters generating it. It is still a good fight 
and the stakes are still high, on both sides, but 
the substance of disagreement has clearly 
diminished within the profession, the argu­
ments have become less dramatic, the mem­
bership less polarized, and the social and 
political context less conducive to clear-cut 
definition and resolution of the issues. Never­
theless, they retain their vital, ultimate impor­
tance to anthropology and will continue to 
trouble it as a discipline and a profession 
through periods of both apathy and concern. 
I have gone through those now rare and 
yellowed documents, letters, telegrams, pro­
nouncements, minutes of endless meetings, 
and recaptur ed some of the vitality I remem­
ber from that bygone era -the issues debated, 
the evidence cited, the strategies planned, the 
counterstrategies detected -and was reminded 
of the names and actions of coconspirators, 
adversaries, and commentators whom I had 
not seen or thought of for years, as well as those who are oft-and well-remembered. They 
are all there in the dusty files of the faithful 
and, no doubt, in those of the faithless as well. 
They await some energetic chronicler of our 
profession to bring them systematically to light 
as an exercise in the sociology (or anthropol­
ogy) of knowledge, social change, and history. 
At the time of these events, American mili­
tary involvement in Vietnam, both direcdy and 
via Thailand, was heavy and rapidly escalat­
ing. Chad Gordon put it clearly in a memo to 
the Cambridge Project advisory board which 
objected to that involvement: "As the Defense 
Department's posture in the world becomes 
increasingly bizarre and dangerous, any par­
ticipant in such projects will undoubtedly feel 
called upon to account for his action to col­
leagues, students and the wider public" 
(quoted by Coburn 1969:1253). Coburn adds, 
with renewed relevance today to the proposed 
dCoE, "It is this issue of accountability that 
troubles many" (ibid.). 
Such concerns were widespread even as 
those, including anthropo logists, whose ac­
tions inspired them were running amok with 
their involvement as advisers and contribut ors 
to military adventurism (Student Mobilization 
Commit tee 1970; Flanagan 1971). 
Committee on Ethics and 
Principles of Professional 
Responsibil ity 
At the end of 1968, the Executive Board of 
the AAA appointed an ad hoc Commit tee on 
Ethics, whose mission was "to consider ques­
tions of the role of the Associatipn with regard 
to ethical conduct on the part of anthropolo­
gists," and to report the results of their delib­
erations to the Executive Board (Newsletter, 
1969:3). 
The ad hoc committee was composed of 
David Schneide r, cochairman (University of 
Chicago), who played a key role in selecting 
his co-members, David Aberle, cochairman 
(University of British Columbia), Richard N. 
Adams (University of Texas), Joseph jorgensen 
(U.niversity of Michigan), William Shack (Uni­
versity of lllinois, Chicago Circle), and Eric 
Wolf (University of Michigan). They met on 

ETHICS VERSUS "REALISM" IN ANTHROPOLOGY 301 
25-6 January 1969 and wrote a report which 
included a recommendation for an elected 
"Standing Commit tee on Ethics" of the asso­
ciation. Defining in detail the responsibilities 
of the proposed standing committee, the ad 
hoc committee outlined "the framework for 
the issues that the Commit tee on Ethics must 
consider." This constituted, in effect, a draft 
code of ethics for the AAA , and was published 
in the April 1969 issue of the Newsletter 
(compare: ad hoc Committee on Ethics, 
Newsletter, 1969:3-6, with Principles of 
Professional Responsibility , Newsletter, 
1970f: 14-16). 
That draft code was perhaps too radical for 
the Executive Board in those turbulent times, 
for they tabled it and attended only to a second 
recommendation of the ad hoc committee, 
namely, 
I 
IMMEDIATE election of an Ethics Committee 
DIRECTLY responsible to the electorate of 
Fellows (and of students enfranchised) .... 
The Committee urged that the new, elected 
Committee ... be independent of the Board. 
. . . This recommendation was NOT accepted 
by the Board .... It agreed to hold an election 
for a pro tern Ethics Committee concurrent 
with the autumn [1969] election of the 
President-Elect and new members of the Exec­
utive Board . (Newsletter, 1969:3) 
Thus, the two bodies agreed on the principle 
of an elected ethics committee, bur disagreed 
on whether it should be responsible directly to 
the electorate or to the Executive Board. This 
difference of opinion remained a bone of con­
tention for years because, once the elected 
Committee on Ethics was in place, it defined 
its respons ibility as being directly to the mem­
bership of the association, which the Executive 
Board disputed. 
The mission of the new commit tee was to 
include consideration of the advisability and 
nature of an ethics code. The elected commit­
tee would consist of nine elected members 
except that initially, for purposes of continu­
ity, three would carry over for one year from 
the appointed ad hoc committee, while six 
would be elected (three allotted terms of three 
years and the other three, terms of two years). 
In addition there would be a member of the 
Executive Board to serve ex officio as a non-voting liaison member of the committee. Those 
elected in the fall of 1969 were Norman 
Chance (University of Connecticut), Robert 
Ehrich (Brooklyn College, CUNY), Wayne 
Suttles (Portland State University), Terence 
Turner (University of Chicago), Oswald 
Werner (Northwestern University), and I (Uni­
versity of Calif ornia, Berkeley ). Those carried 
over from the ad hoc committee were Eric 
Wolf (chair), Joseph Jorgensen, and William 
Shack. David Aberle, who had been a member 
of the ad hoc committee, had in the meantime 
been elected to the Executive Board, which 
appointed him as liaison member to the pro 
tern committee. 
The newly constituted committee met 
several times, working primarily toward the 
preparation of a code of ethics, which it sub­
mitted to the Executive Board in May 1970. 
The board promptly retitled it "Principles of 
Professional Respons ibility" (to soften the 
blow for members who did not want anyone 
to subject them to the constraints a "code" 
seems to imply), and it was published in the 
November 1970 Newsletter, as cited above . 
After heated debate in the columns of the 
Newsletter, in commit tees, at annual meetings, 
in departments, and in private, and after many 
intervening crises in the Executive Board, the 
Committee on Ethics, the council, and within 
the membership, the principles were adopted 
by vote of the association in May 1971. 
The PPR's initial year, spanning the period 
from its formulation to its adoption, was a 
stormy one, to say the least. On 30 !vlarch 
1970, the Student Mobilization Committee to 
Stop the War in Vietnam (SMC) sem to a 
number of scholars, including some members 
of the Commit tee on Ethics of the AAA , as well 
as to people in other academic disciplines (pri­
marily people involved in Asian studies 
of various sorts), materials indicating partici­
pation by scholars in what they regarded as 
clandestine, counterinsur gency research and 
other activities in Southeast Asia under spon­
sorship of various United States governmental 
agencies, including such mission-orie nted 
ones as the Departments of Defense and State 
and special agencies within them. The SMC 
planned to release a report on these documents 
at a press conference they had called for 3 April 
at the Annual Meeting of the Association for 

302 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
Asian Studies, to be held in San Francisco 
during the first week of April 1970, and at 
another press conference scheduled simultane­
ously, or nearly so, in Washington, DC. The 
materials were minutes, letters, reports, finan­
cial accountings, publications, and similar con­
tents of the files of an anthropo logy professor 
at a major West Coast university, copied by a 
student employee of the professor from files to 
which she had legitimate access in the course 
of her work. She had regarded their contents 
as alarming, and had taken the liberty of 
making copies for herself, which she then 
turned over to the Student Mobilization Com­
mittee. The SMC proceeded to publish them in 
the 2 April 1970 edition of The Student Mobi­
lizer, under the edition title Counterinsu rgency 
Research on Campus Exposed. At the press 
conferences arranged to announce these find­
ings and distribute The Student Mobilizer, four 
of the scholars who had been sent advance 
copies of some of the documents issued state� 
ments condemning the work that had been 
exposed: Eric Wolf, Joseph Jorgensen, Mar­
shall Sahlins (in Washington, DC), and I (in San 
Francisco). Later, others joined in condemning 
that which had been exposed, while still others 
condemned the exposure and those who par­
ticipated in it and those who had decried the 
activities exposed. Some wrote of "liberated" 
documents; others of "purloined" ones. Con­
troversy raged, charges and countercharges, 
insults and counterinsults were traded, law­
suits were threatened (though since no law had 
been broken, none was ever filed). For vivid 
and partisan accounts -and all were partisan 
in this matter, including me-see "Anthropol­
ogy on the Warpath in Thailand" (Wolf and 
Jorgensen 1970a:26-36) and "Anthropolo gy 
on the Warpath: An Exchange" (Foster et al. 
1971:43-6). 
The Executive Board wrote a stinging (and, 
I would have to say, ill-informed) letter on 19 
May 1970, reprimanding the Committee on 
Ethics and, specifically , Wolf and Jorgensen 
for their statements and actions (Newsletter, 
1970b: 1, 1 0). The letter included these 
remarks: 
The Board instructs the Ethics Committee 
to limit itself to its specific charge, narrowly 
interpreted, namely to present to the Board recomme ndations on its future role and func­
tions, and to fulfill this charge without further 
collection of case materials or by any quasi­
investigative activities. 
It concluded that "the Board explicitly 
instructs the members of the Ethics Commit­
tee ... to make dear in individual statements 
that they do not speak for the Committee or 
the Association. "3 It was the alleged violation 
of this last after-the-fact instruction which evi­
dently brought the wrath of the Board down 
on Wolf and Jorgensen for their joint state­
ment on the SMC revelations, and exempted ­
at least from explicit condemnation -Sahlins 
and me. Sahlins was exempted because he was 
not on the committee, and I was because my 
statement was made as an Asianist scholar in 
the context of the Association for Asian 
Studies meetings, rather than as a member of 
the AAA ethics committee. Wolf and Jorgensen 
had identified themselves as members of the 
ethics committee and indicated their intent to 
bring "these serious matters" to the attention 
of the American Anthropolo gical Association, 
but in no way did they imply that they were 
speaking for the Committee on Ethics. They 
responded quickly, strongly, and in detail in a 
letter dated 25 May 1970 to the president and 
president-elect of the association, the Execu­
tive Board (which includes those two officers), 
and the Committee on Ethics. They concluded 
the letter with their resignation from the com­
mittee, pointing out that 
In its Statement the Board wishes the Ethics 
Committee to limit itself to its specific charge, 
narrowly interpreted; but it is not equally spe­
cific about its own intention to cope with the 
issues raised by an applied anthropolo gy 
which has for its focal concern the internal 
security of the present Thailand government. 
In drawing attention to the action of particu­
lar members of the Ethics Committee, the 
Board evidently hoped to avert a threat to the 
internal harmony of our Association. In not 
applying themselves with equal diligence to an 
analysis of the issues which prompted these 
individual actions, the Board averts its eyes 
from the real sources of a danger which 
threatens not only the integrity of the Associ­
ation, but the fate and welfare of the peoples 
among whom we work. In view of the failure 
of the Board to interpret its mandate to the 

ETHICS VERSUS "REALISM " IN ANTHROPOLOGY 303 
Ethics Committee to include a concern of vital 
relevance to the profession, we ourselves fail 
ro perceive how the Committee can "present 
to the Board recommendations on its future 
role and functions." We therefore tender our 
resignations as Chairman and Member of the 
Committee on Ethics. (Wolf and Jorgensen 
1970b, which includes not only this letter, bur 
the letter and other documents which the 
Executive Board found untenable)." 
Within a week, David Aberle resigned as the 
board's liaison member on the Committee 
on Ethics (Aberle 1970:19), while Wolf and 
Jorgensen encouraged other members to 
remain on the committee to continue its work. 
A month later, in response to demands from 
both sides of the controversy , David Schneid er, 
then a member of the Executive Board, pro­
posed that a commit tee be appoint ed to look 
into the1entire issue, both the activities of the 
Committee on Ethics and those of anthropol­
ogists working in Thailand. Accordingly, the 
Executive Board quickly appointed the "Ad 
Hoc Commit tee to Evaluate the Controversy 
Concerning Anthropological Activities in 
Relation to Thailand," consisting of three 
members: Margaret Mead, chair (Columbia 
University and American Museum of Natural 
History); William Davenport (University of 
California, Santa Cruz); David Olmsted (Uni­
versity of California, Davis); and, as executive 
secretary, Ruth Freed (New York University 
and American Museum of Natural History). 
This ad hoc committee {often called the "Mead 
Committee") collected documents from a 
variety of sources, many of them from the 
Commit tee on Ethics, and others from princi­
pals in the controversy and from other people 
knowledgeable about Thailand and the issues 
of the controversy. By this committee's 
account, ''all members of the ad hoc commit­
tee and its Executive Secretary ... examined 
all of these materials in detail,, and in the 
process "approximately 6000 pages were read, 
and many reread in order for the ad hoc com­
mittee to write this report" (Davenport et al. 
1971:2). This achievement was the more 
remarkable in view of the fact that the com­
mittee's chairperson was for much of the year 
in the South Pacific. The six-page report that 
resulted was submitted to the Executive Board 
on 27 September 1971. It totally exonerated all members of the American Anthropological 
Association of any ethical wrongdoing in the 
context of this controversy: "t. No civilian 
member of the American Anthropological 
Association had contravened the principles 
laid down in the 1967 Statement on Problems 
of Anthropological Research and Ethics (Beals 
Report) in his or her work in Thailand" 
(Davenport et al. 1971 :4). It went on to 
explain seeming offenses as merely misleading 
claims in research applications and reports 
made necessary by a climate where defense 
relevance was required in order to obtain 
government funding for research. As the com­
mittee put it, "The mislabeling or redirecting 
of scientific projects in order to obtain funds 
may have seemed necessary: it may also have 
prepared anthropologists ... to close their 
eyes to misuse of their data ... and ... 
talents" (ibid., 4 ). It was suggesting that 
"counterins urgency" may have been merely a 
buzzword incorporated in applications and 
reports to release funds for the author's schol­
arly research, just as earlier buzzwords such as 
"community development'' and ''mental 
health" served this function. 
At the same time, the Mead Commit tee rep­
rimanded the members of the Commit tee on 
Ethics who, it said, "acted hastily, unfairly, and 
unwisely in making public statements ... 
without first having consulted the anthropolo­
gists named in the purloined documents which 
formed the basis of their charges, and wtrhout 
having obtained authorization from the 
Board" (ibid.). The Mead Report was pre­
sented to the Council of the AAA in New York 
at its annual meeting on 19 November 1971, 
where by vote of the assembled body, and over 
the vehement objections of its authors, it was 
divided into three substantive sections and pre­
sented for discussion preparatory to a vote on 
whether to accept or reject each of the sections: 
part 1 was primarily about the activities of 
anthropologists in Thailand; part 2 was pri­
marily on the actions of the Commit tee on 
Ethics; and part 3 constituted proposed guide­
lines, recomm endations, and resolutions. 
The debate, before some four hundred 
members, focused on the exoneration of those 
who had been criticized for their work in 
Thailand. The atmosphere was tense in view 
of the demands of the chairperson of the ad 

304 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
hoc committee, on behalf of herself and the 
other authors, that the report not be put to a 
vote but simply be put in the record as sub­
mined (for the handwriting was already on the 
wall), and the membership' s determinat ion, 
ratified in short order by its vote, to put each 
section to a vote. No doubt the most telling 
moments in the discussion of the report were 
when two members of the Committee on 
Ethics, responding to the assertion that no 
civilian member of the AAA had contravened 
the ethical principles of the association in their 
work in Thailand, read from two egregiously 
unethical projects in which civilian fellows of 
the association had been directly involved, as 
demonstrated in documents which the ad hoc 
committee had had in its hands, provided 
by the Commit tee on Ethics. The first was as 
follows, as reported in its author's own 
abstract of the project: 
AD-468 413 Military Research and Develop- . 
ment Center, Bangkok (Thailand) LOW ALTI­
TUDE VISUAL SEARCH FOR INDIVID UAL HUMAN 
TARGETS : FURTHER FIELD TESTING IN SOUTH­
EAST ASIA. By !an anthropologist] 15 June 65, 
83 pp. Unclassified. Project description text: 
This report is a detailed study of quantita­
tive information on the ability of airborne 
observers to sight and identify single humans 
on the ground. The target background for 
most of the testing was rice paddy with scat­
tered bushes and trees at the end of the dry 
season in Southeast Asia ... [etc., etc.]. 
The second item read to the membership 
consisted of excerpts from a forty-four-page 
proposal in which a fellow of the AAA 
was involved, titled "Counter-Insur gency in 
Thailand: The Impact of Economic, Social and 
Political Action Programs . ., This was a half­
million-dollar social science research and devel­
opment proposal submitt ed to the Advanced 
Research Projects Agency of the Department of 
Defense by the American Institutes for 
Research of Pittsburgh in 1967. After intro­
ducing the problem, to design preventive coun­
terinsur gency measures for Thailand and to 
.. h ' 
pave t e way for the generalization of the 
methodology to other programs in other coun­
tries" (p. ii, see below), the proposal went on to 
state: 
The struggle between an established govern­
ment and insurgent forces involves three dif-ferent types of operations: the first is to make 
inputs into the social system that will gain the 
active support of an ever-increasing propor­
tion of the population. Threats, promises, ide­
ological appeals, and tangible benefits are the 
kinds of inputs that are most frequently used. 
The second is to reduce or interdict the flow 
of the competing inputs being made by the 
opposing side by installing anti-infilt ration 
devices, cutting communications lines, assas­
sinating key spokesmen, strengthening retal­
iatory mechanisms and similar preventative 
measures. The third is to counteract or neu­
tralize the political successes already achieved 
by groups committed to the "wrong" side. 
This typically involves direct military 
confron ration. 
The social scientist can make significant 
contributions to the design of all three types 
of operations. (American Institutes for 
Research, 1967:1; all emphasis added) 
The proposal continues in this vein for forty­
four chilling pages. In the final paragraph of 
what is termed the "Operational Plan," we 
read the following: "The potential applicabil­
ity of the findings in the United States will also 
receive special attention. In many of our key 
domestic programs, especially those directed 
at disadvantaged sub-cultures, the method­
ological problems are highly similar to those 
described in this proposal, and the application 
of the Thai findings at home constitutes a 
potentially most significant project contribu­
tion, (ibid., 34; emphasis added). 
The proposal was accepted and funded, but 
its semiannual reports are classified, hence 
unavailable -for good reason, one suspects. 
(See Berreman 1981a:72-126, wherein many 
more examples of ethically questionable and 
untenable anthropologica l proJects are 
itemized.) 
In that great auditorium where over four 
hundred anthropologists were seated, there 
followed a deathly silence. No rebuttal was 
offered by the Mead Commit tee or from the 
membership. The votes were held on the three 
sections and the report was overwhelm ingly 
rejected, section by section. The Newsletter of 
January 1972 reported it on page 1 under the 
headline "COUNCIL REJECTS THAI CONTRO­
VERSY COMMI TTEE 'S REPORT. , After intro­
ducing the account in general, the article 
proceeded: "The first part in this division [of 

ETHICS VERSUS "REALISM " IN ANTHROPOLOGY 305 
the report for purposes of the vote] ... was 
rejected by a vote of 308 to 74. The second 
part was also rejected, 243 to 57. And a final 
motion to consider the issue of anthropolo­
gists' actions in Thailand unresolved and to 
reject the remainder of the report ... was 
carried by a vote of 214 to 14 as the clock 
move into Saturday and the Council dwindled 
away" (Newsletter, 1972:1). 
In the same issue of the Newsletter, two 
letters were printed as "Replies to the Report 
of the Ad Hoc Commit tee to Evaluate the 
Thailand Controversy," both of which had 
been distributed to the council at its meeting. 
One, by Wolf and Jorgensen, gave point­
by-point rebuttals to many of the ad hoc com­
mittee's assertions and concluded that "we are 
as much dismayed by the callousness of the 
report as by its factual and theoretical faults." 
The other letter was by May N. Diaz and 
Lucile F. Newman, who challenged the report 
and concluded that "anthropologists cannot 
serve both science and war" (ibid., 3-4). 
That, then, is the context within which 
·the Principles of Professional Responsibility 
originated and evolved. It is against this 
background that we must understand the 
emergence of the draft Code of Ethics, changes 
in the role and function of the Commit tee on 
Ethics, and even the reorganization of the 
American Anthropological Association. I think 
these three changes are symptomatic of 
common forces at work within the profession, 
common pressures from without, and common 
processes at work on the national and inter­
national levels. They comprise a shift away 
from idealism and toward self-interested prac­
ticality. It is to the demand for a new code of 
ethics as a symptom of these broader discon­
tents, and to the implications of that demand 
and those discontents, that I now turn -or 
return. 
The Draft Code of Ethics: 
Text and Context 
The Principles of Professional Responsibili ty, 
having been adopted in 1971 and having 
served the profession adequately , if not 
remarkab ly, for some years as a cautionary 
and exemplary model more than as an enforce­
ment mechanism or deterrent (although with the potential to serve those functions as well), 
gradually lost the attention of the membership 
it was designed to serve, as did the committee 
which was to sustain and implement it. There 
had been only three amendments to it since its 
adoption: one, in 1974, relating to plagiarism 
(Newsletter, 1974:9); and two in 1975, one 
requiring that informants be apprised of the 
fact that anonymity cannot be guaranteed 
against the possibility of accidental disclosure, 
and the other advising that exclusionary poli­
cies against colleagues on the basis of non­
academic attributes and the transmittal of such 
irrelevant factors in personnel actions is uneth­
ical (Newsletter, 1975:1 ). The only overall 
revision as such was the removal of generic use 
of the masculine pronoun from the document 
in about 1976. 
According to the October 1984 Newsletter, 
"by 1975, active concerns had surfaced about 
aspects of the PPR and the grievance proce­
dures. The growing number of non-academi­
cally based anthropologists held that the PPR 
was based only on academic considerations 
... Important inconsistencies and ambiguities 
were found in the various documents relating 
to ethics" (Newsletter, 1984:2). In short, and 
in currently popular jargon, the hegemony of 
academic anthropol ogy, and especially of aca­
demic social and cultural anthropo logy, was 
challenged. The Executive Board asked the 
Committee on Ethics to consider these and 
related problems and to propose remedies. It 
did so, and its suggestions were circulated to 
committees and individuals in the association. 
In 1980, an ad hoc committee was appointed 
to prepare a new draft code. It was made up 
of Karl Heider, chair (University of South 
Carolina); Barry Bainton and Alice Brues 
(University of Colorado, Boulder); Jerald 
Milanich (University of Florida and Florida 
State Museum); and john Roberts (University 
of Pittsburgh). After the committee members 
had prepared the draft and it had been circu­
lated, commented upon, and revised, it was 
finally considered by the Executive Board to be 
"ready to go to the membership" in 1982 
(ibid.). However, in view of the fact that the 
association was in the throes of reorganization 
at that time-which process, like the proposed 
new code, was designed to facilitate and 
respond to changes in the profession and espe­
cially to its members' employment structure -

306 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
it was thought the membership might be dis­
tracted from attending adequately to the ad 
hoc committ ee's proposals on ethics. Accord­
ingly, it was decided that the proposed code 
would be withheld from the membership until 
the fall of 1984. Therefore, the draft Code of 
Ethics (dCoE) was first presented to the mem­
bership when it was published in the October 
1984 Newsletter (ibid.). 
An "open forum" on the proposed dCoE 
was held at the November 1984 annual meet­
ings in Denver. These were also the first meet­
ings of the AAA organized to reflect the 
reorganization of the association into its five 
major divisions, now merged with its previ­
ously "affiliated" societies. In spite of the 
chaotic novelty of these changes, there was a 
lively debate on the ethics proposal - a debate 
which was reviewed, with discussion invited, 
by President-elect Helm in the April Newslet­
ter (Helm 1985:1). Thereaf ter, the Newsletter 
was sprinkled with letters and commentarie s 
on the subject, displaying a variety of opinions 
and commitments, in the months leading to the 
1985 annual meetings in Washington, DC, at 
which the session on "Ethics, Professionalism 
and the Future of Anthropology" (where the 
contents of this chapter were originally pre­
sented) was held. 
These events were in accord with the origi­
nal declaration in the PPR that it would be 
.. from rime to rime" scrutinized and revised as 
the membership of the AAA "sees fit or as 
circumstances dictate" (Professional Ethics, 
1983:5). 
The 1985 session on ethics was aimed at 
bringing out key facts, issues, and points of 
view surrounding the proposed changes in the 
ethjcal stance of the AAA in the context of 
scholarly presentations and intellectual discus­
sion, not to exclude debate and commitment, 
but with the goal of providing more light than 
heat. 
Ethics versus Practicality: 
An Interpr etation 
The remainder of this chapter will comprise 
my response to the status or condition of ethics 
in the AAA as it has emerged since 1985. It is 
an interpretation, therefore, rather than, as above, a historical review. One must be famil­
iar with both the PPR and the dCoE to con­
sider the matter fairly, which is why I have 
delved into history at such length and why, in 
addition, these two critical documents are 
reproduced in this volume. 
There are four major changes proposed in 
the draft Code of Ethics -four deletions from 
the Principles of Professional Responsibility -
which I regard as drastic. These four must be 
clearly stated and directly addressed in the 
implications they hold for anthropology and 
anthropolo gists to convey why I, and many 
others, regard the changes as pernicious. 
First is the downgrading -the virtual elimi­
nation -of the primary and fundamental tenet 
of the Principles: "1. Relations with those 
studied: In research, anthropologists' para­
mount responsibility is to those they study." 
Second is the elimination of secret and clan­
destine activity in anthropological endeavors 
as constituting violations of anthropolo gical 
ethics. 
Third is removal of the principle of 
accountabil ity of the anthropologist for viola­
tions of ethical principles -removal of any 
mention of sanctions, or their legitimacy, to 
say nothing of eliminating all traces of mech­
anisms for enjoining adherence to ethical 
principles. 
Fourth is deletion of anthropologists' posi­
tive responsibilities to society at large, their 
own and/or those they study: the responsibil­
ity to convey their findings and the implica­
tions thereof forthrightly to all concerned fully 
and publicly, to the best of their professional 
abilities. 
I maintain that these omissions have resulted 
not in a code at all, but a mild statement of 
intent, and one conspicuou �ly devoid of ethical 
content. It is in fact, I think, a license for un­
fettered free-enterprise research, advising and 
engineering disguised as anthropol ogy, with 
the intent of employing the ethical reputation 
of the discipline to enable and facilitate a wide 
range of mission-oriented activities, including 
those of dubious ethical and even egregiously 
unethical nature.5 To title the draft document 
"Code of Ethics" is to misrepresent it seri­
ously. It might be better to adopt a title paral­
lel to that of the PPR -this one: Principles of 
Professional Irresponsibility {PPI). To do so 

ETHICS VERSUS "REALISM" IN ANTHROPOLOGY 307 
would serve the interests of candor and 
thereby make at least one contribution to 
ethics in the profession. 
I will briefly discuss these four principles-by­
omission, in reverse order. 
Positive responsibilities in 
anthropology 
To my mind the most insidious, because incon­
spicuous, deletion from the PPR in the dCoE 
is the issue of the positive responsibility of 
anthropologists to let it be known publicly 
what they have learned and what they believe 
its implications to be for all concerned. It is 
stated this way in the PPR: 
2. Responsibility w the Public: 
d. . ... Anthropologists bear a positive 
£esponsibility to speak out publicly, 
both individually and collectively, on 
what they know and what they believe 
as a result of their professional exper­
tise gained in the study of human 
beings. That is, they bear a professional 
responsibility to contribute to an "ade­
quate definition of reality" [Mills 
1963:611] upon which public opinion 
and public policy may be based. 
That is, we acknowle dge a responsibility to 
practice what C. Wright Mills (ibid., and 
1959:178-9) called "the politics of truth" for, 
as he insisted, in the defining instance, truth is 
our politics and our responsibility (Mills 
1963:611). If we do not fulfill this responsi­
bility, we are nothing more than human engi­
neers -hirelings in the service of any agency 
with any agenda that can buy our expertise, as 
some indeed became during the Vietnam War. 
This theme has pervaded virtually all discus­
sions of ethics in our profession during the 
past twenty-five years (cf. Berreman 1968, 
1981b). 
Accountability 
Now it is proposed that we adopt a code of 
ethics without accountability. In the dCoE 
there is no mechanism whatsoever by which 
individuals can be held to account for their 
actions, no matter how blatantly and destruc­
tively they flaunt their profession's ethical standards and regardless of how bland such 
standards may be. 
Why? Do those who propose and endorse 
this deletion intend to leave open the opportu­
nity to violate at will the very principles of 
ethical conduct upon which their profession 
has agreed? I hope not. Is the statement in the 
PPR too harsh, too constrainin g, too danger­
ous? I think not. Accountability is mentioned 
in the PPR only in its epilogue, where it is stated: 
In the final analysis, anthropological research 
is a human undertaking, dependent upon 
choices for which the individual bears ethical 
as well as scientific responsibility. That 
responsibility is a human, not superhuman, 
responsibility. To err is human, to forgive 
humane. This statement of principles of pro­
fessional responsibility is not designed to 
punish, but to provide guidelines which can 
minimize the occasions upon which there is a 
need to forgive. Whetz anthropol ogists, by 
their actions, ;eopardize peoples studied, pro­
fessional colleagues, students, or others, or if 
they otherwise betray their professional com­
mitments, their colleagues may legitimately 
inquire into the propriety of those actions, 
and take such measures as lie within the legit­
imate power of their Association as the mem­
bership of the Association deems appropriate. 
(Professional Ethics, 1983:2; emphasis added) 
The italicized sentence is a statement of 
accountability and is the nearest thing in the 
PPR to a mechanism for its enforcement. Is it 
too threatening to the new anthropology, to 
practicing anthropolo gy, to be incorporated 
into the proposed code? Does it go against the 
spirit and intent of the dCoE? I think so. It must 
be remembered that in the Vietnam anthropol­
ogist-warriors' case it was accountability that 
was the issue; it was accountability that was 
denied by one side and insisted upon by the 
other. Maybe that is the crux of the problem 
now; maybe that is what the draft code pro­
poses to protect future warrior-anthropolo gists 
from. Perhaps now all's to be fair in love, war, 
and anthropology; maybe it is proposed that 
henceforth there is to be no more honor among 
anthropologists than has long been claimed 
to be among thieves. Are we witnessing an 
attempt to exempt us as scholars, as scientists, 
as anthropolo gists from the principle invoked 
by the United Nations at Nuremburg after 

308 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
World War D, which held accountable soldiers 
and bureaucrats who sought to evade being 
held responsible for their atrocities on the 
ground that they were only doing their jobs, 
for their country? Do the anthropolo gists 
protesting against accountability not protest 
too much? If so, again we must ask, why? If, 
as I prefer to believe is the case (because I am 
ever charitable in such matters), the aim is 
simply to forestall the possibility of an ethics 
witch-hunt, it is misguided - a clear case of the 
proposed cure being worse than the affliction. 
There is a striking lack of evidence to even 
suggest that the PPR is conducive to such an 
eventual ity. In its twenty-year history, the 
Committee on Ethics has pursued only one case 
that I know of to the Executive Board, and no 
case went any funher than that for, in the 
balance of power enacted into the "Rules and 
Procedures" (Professional Ethics, 1983:7-9), 
the Executive Board must agree with the Com­
mittee on Ethics that there is a prima facie case 
of ethical violation for the matter to be pursued 
further. That has not, to my knowledge, ever 
occurred. But I believe that the possibility of 
censure or other measures of accountability 
within the association, however mild and sym­
bolic, gives credjbility to our claims to ethical 
standards and therefore has a salutary effect 
in their realization, which a purely and piously 
advisory "code" would not. 
Secrecy and clandestine activity 
We are urged to consider adoption of an ethics 
for anthropological endeavor which tolerates 
secret and clandestine activities or, as the 
president-elect suggested in 1985, which 
permits secret activity but prohibits that which 
is clandestine: perhaps she can explain it; I 
cannot: 
The PPR coupling of "clandestine and secret 
research .. may constitut e a prima facie con­
demnation of some anthropolo gists employed 
in non-academic settings. In this ... respect, it 
appears that the first step might be ro set aside 
the pejorative concept "clandestine" from the 
consideration of ethical issues arising in 
employment and research -notably for gov­
ernment, business, industry and special inter­
est groups - that may involve some form or 
degree of secrecy. (Helm 1985:13) Yet again, why? Is it, as seems to be the argu­
ment, that although "secret" and "cland es­
tine" mean the same they are after all 
necessary activities in the minds of some prac­
ticing anthropolo gists and "clandestinen 
sounds worse? 
It should be noted that the repudiation of 
secret or clandestine activity in the name of 
anthropolo gy has been the most long-standing 
and the most consistently , unequivocally enun­
ciated of ethical principles embraced by Amer­
ican anthropologists. From our earlie st 
expressions of ethical concern as an associa­
tion and a profession, no secret or clandestine 
research, no secret reports, have been tolerated 
among us. In 1948, the association adopted a 
resolution on freedom of publication and pro­
tection of the interests of those studied. It 
thereby anticipated the PPR by addressing two 
of its four key principles, now repudiated in 
the dCoE. That resolution forty years ago 
stated in part: "(1) that the AAA strongly 
urge[s] all sponsoring institutions to guarantee 
their research scientists complete freedom to 
interpret and publish their findings without 
censorship or interference; provided that (2) 
the interests of the persons and communities 
or other social groups studied are protected'' 
(American Anthropological Association 
1949:370). That resolution was reaffirmed by 
the association in its 1967 "Statement on 
Problems and Anthropological Research and 
Ethics," the introduction to which asserted 
that, "constraint, deception and secrecy have 
no place in science. Actions which compromise 
the intellectual integrity and autonomy of 
research scholars ... not only weaken those 
international understandings essential to our 
discipline, but in so doing they also threaten 
any contribution anthro pology might make to 
our own society and to the general interests of 
human welfare" (Professional Ethics, 1983:3). 
The statement went on to quote and endorse 
the 1948 resolution quoted above and, in 
order "to extend and strengthen this resolu­
tion," added that, 
Except in the event of a declaration of war 
by Congress [note: there was no such dec­
laration in the Vietnam War], academic 
institutions should not undertake activities 
or accept contracts in anthropolo gy that 
are not related to their normal function of 

ETHICS VERSUS "REALISM " IN ANTHROPOLOGY 309 
teaching, research and public service. They 
should not lend themselves to clandestine 
activities. We deplore unnecessary restric­
tive classifications of research reports ... 
and excessive security regulations imposed 
on participating academic personnel. 
3. The best interests of scientific research are 
not served by the imposition of external 
restrictions. The review procedures insti­
tuted for foreign area research contracts by 
... the Department of State ... offer a dan­
gerous potential for censorship of research. 
Additional demands [for clearance and the 
like) ... are incompatible with effective 
anthropological research. (Ibid.) 
There followed an unambiguous resolution 
passed at the annual meetings of the AAA in 
1969, ratified by mail ballot in the spring of 
1970: "Resolution 13 (Karen Sacks), Resolved 
that members of the AAA shall not engage in 
any secret or classified research" (Newsletter, 
1970a; 1970c). 
A year later, the issue of secrecy and clan­
destine activity was addressed directly by the 
membership of the AAA when it adopted the 
Principles of Professional Responsibility, 
which dealt with it in at least six places in the 
body of the principle s and once in an appen­
dix -an indication of the great importance 
such activity has continued to hold in our pro­
fession. It is worthwhile to extract and quote 
each of these treatments of the issue so that we 
are vividly reminded of the enormity of the 
deletion of this subject from the dCoE: 
From the PPR: 
1. Relations with those studied: ... 
g. In accordance with the Association' s 
general position on clandestine and 
secret research, no reports should be 
provided to sponsors that are not also 
available to the general public and, 
where practicable, to the population 
studied. 
2. Responsibility to the public: 
a. Anthropolo gists should not communi­
care findings secretly to some and with­
hold them from others. 
3. Responsibility to the discipline: 
a. Anthropologists should undertake no 
secret research or any research whose 
results cannot be freely derived and 
publicly reported. b. Anthropologists should avoid even the 
appearance of engaging in clandestine 
research, by fully and freely disclosing 
the aims and sponsorship of all 
research. 
5. Responsibilit y to sponsors: 
.... Anthropologists should be especially 
careful not to promise or imply accep­
tance of conditions contrary to their 
professional ethics or competing com­
mitments. This requires that they require 
of sponsors full disclosure of the sources of 
funds, personnel, aims of the institution 
and the research project, and disposi­
tion of research results. Anthropologists 
must retain the right to make all ethical 
decisions in their research. They should 
enter into no secret agreements with 
sponsors regarding rcsean:h, results or 
reports. 
6. Responsibility to one's own government 
and to host governments: 
. ... !Anthropologists] should demand 
assurance that they will not be required to 
compromise their professional responsibil­
ities and ethics as a condition of their per­
mission ro pursue research. Specifical ly, no 
secret research, no secret reports or 
debriefings of any kind should be agreed to 
or given. If these matters are clearly under­
stood in advance, serious complications 
and misunderstandin gs can generally be 
avoided. (Professional Ethics, 1 983:1-2) 
Appendix C: A Note on "Clandestine., 
The 1967 Random House DictiOnary of the 
English La11guage, defines the term clandes­
tine as follow: 
characterized by, done for, or executed with 
secrecy or concealment, especially for pur­
poses of subversion or deception; private or 
surreptitious. 
The I Ethics] Committee construes these 
definitions to mean that the concealment of 
resean:h goals from a subje�o:t population 
(including nonarticularion of such goals when 
they include potentially injurious conse­
quences to the social, economic, cultural 
and/or physical well being of the population) 
or other forms of deception of the population 
with respect to the uses to whi�.:h the 
researcher is aware the data he gathers will be 
put, regardless of whether or not the resea rch 
program itself is kept secret or whether pub­
lications issuing from it are classified, properly 

310 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
falls within the meaning of the term "clan­
destine" and thus is in violation of the 1967 
resolution ["Statement on Problems of 
Anthropological Research and Ethics"}. 
(Annual Report of the Committee on Ethics, 
September 1970, Newsletter, 1970f:16) 
In thinking back to Helm's suggestion that 
clandestine be distinguished from secret, and 
the former be prohibited and the latter per­
mitted, it seems that secret is to be the word 
for approved clandestinity; clandestine will be 
the word for disapproved secrecy or,, as she 
wrote, the "pejorative" word for secrecy. 
Whatever the termino logy, it is clear that the 
draft code, in rescuing secret and clandestine 
activities from the list of unethical practices, is 
proposing that they be regarded as acceptable, 
necessar y, even desirable {in the case of prac­
ticing anthropologists) items in the anthropo­
logical bag of methodological tricks. This l 
regard as abject surrender of principle to a 
misguided practicality; a sacrifice of public 
interest to misperceived self-interest: replacing 
ethics with greed. 6 
I had thought these matters through well 
before joining the Committee on Ethics or con­
fronting the task of helping prepare a code of 
ethics. At the risk of offering a surfeit of my 
own opinions on the subject, I will offer some 
words of my own, presented in a paper for the 
presidential panel titled "The Funding of Asian 
Studies,... at the Association for Asian Studies 
annual meeting in 1970 (the same meeting, 
incidentally, at which the Student Mobilization 
Committee held its press conference discussed 
above): 
There is no scholarly activity any of us can do 
better in secret than in public. There is none 
we can pursue as well, in fact, because of the 
implicit but inevitable restraints secrecy places 
on scholarsh ip. To do research in secret, or to 
report it in secret, is to invite suspicion, and 
legitimately so because secrecy is the hallmark 
of intrigue, nor scholarship .... I believe that 
we should make freedom from secrecy an 
unalterable condition of our research. (Berre­
man 197lc:396) 
So much for secret and/or clandestine activity 
as excusable, much less legitimate, by anthro­
pologists, and so much for an ethics that 
permits it. In the new, and otherwise satisf actory (to 
me) "Revised Principles of Professional 
Responsibil ity," prepared after this essay was 
initially written (published for discussion in 
the November 1989 issue of the Anthropology 
Newsletter; submitted for ratification to the 
membership, 15 March 1990), I am alarmed 
to note that the issue of secrecy is side-stepped. 
The word does not appear, nor is the matter 
addressed beyond a single passing mention of 
a commitment to "open inquiry." This strikes 
me as odd, to say the least, in view of the cen­
trality of the issue throughout the history of 
discussions of anthropological ethics in this 
country. To tolerate secret research is to sacri­
fice the credibility of anthropology as a 
research discipline and a humane science. 
Priority of the welfare of those 
studied in anthropology 
Finally, I return to the first of these principles­
in-absentia of the draft Code of Ethics, namely 
deletion from the code of the primary principle 
in the Principles of Professional Responsibility: 
that the welfare of those studied is the anthro­
pologist's paramount responsibil ity. This was 
anticipat ed by a second resolution presented 
to the Council of the Association by Karen 
Sacks at the 1969 annual meetings, which 
was passed there and ratified in the spring of 
1970: 
Resolution 14 (Karen Sacks), 
Resolved that fieldworkers shall not divulge 
any information orally or in writing, solicited 
by government officials, foundations, or cor­
poration representatives about the people 
they study that compromises and/or endan­
gers their well-being and cultural integrity. 
(Newsletter, 1970a; 1970c) 
The Principles of Professional Responsibil ity 
stated this point unambiguously at the head of 
its list of principles. It is worthwhile to repeat 
a bit in order to remind ourselves: 
1. Relations with those studied: 
In research, anthropologists' paramount 
responsibility is to those they study. When 
there is a conflict of interest, these individ­
uals must come first. Anthropologists must 
do everything in their power to protect the 
physical, social and psychological welfare 

ETHICS VERSUS "REALISM" IN ANTHROPOLOGY 311 
and to honor the dignity and privacy of 
those studied. (Professional Ethics, 
1983:1) 
Contrast that statement with the ambiguous 
one in the dCoE (bearing in mind that it is 
perhaps the least ambiguous of all the provi­
sions in that document): 
1. Anthropologists must seriously consider 
their own moral responsibility for their 
acts when there is a risk that an individual, 
group or organization may be hurt, ex­
ploited, or jeopardized physically, legally, 
in reputation, or in self-esteem as a result 
of these acts. (Newsletter, 1984:2) 
Witness the fact that the people we study 
would be dropped not only from the highest 
priority (which they held in the ethical obliga­
tions specified by the PPR), but would virtu­
ally be dropped out of the draft code 
altogether . 7 And note that people are to be 
put on a par with organizations. If one were 
studying the Ku Klux Klan, concern for the 
well-being of individual informants would evi­
dently be reduced to par with that for the KKK 
as an organization (or that of the organization 
would be raised to parity with individual s, as 
proponents might prefer to put it). 
A more fundamental question than the 
quality of the proposed substitute code is why 
the change has been proposed - what forces 
have led to it? 
Reaganethics: The Temper 
of the Times 
The history of the Commi ttee on Ethics since 
1971 has been one of rapid decline -trans­
formation would be a more diplomatic word. 
It has evolved or devolved from a committee 
on ethics to essentially a grievance committee; 
from one concerned with ethical principles and 
practice to one devoted primarily to personnel 
matters: fairness in appointments and promo­
tions, issues of plagiarism, priority of pub­
lication, and conflict of interest (e.g., AAA 
1975:54-5). This parallels a shift in concern 
and involvement of faculty in a number of uni­
versities from issues of academic freedom to 
issues of privilege and tenure (as the respective academic senate committees are called on my 
campus), and a pervasive concern in our 
society with personal well-being at the expense 
of concern with broader principles of social 
justice. 
I do not blame the members of the Associa­
tion's Committee on Ethics for this situation. 
Those are the kinds of cases with which they 
have been saddled. The grievances are legiti­
mate ones, but they should be the responsibil­
ity of a committee constituted for that purpose 
rather than of an ethics committee perverted 
to that purpose. The Committee on Ethics, 
which has evolved in this direction, was largely 
responsible for the draft code, with additional 
input from the significantly named "Commit­
tee on Anthropo logy and the Profession." The 
combination of an ethics committee concerned 
largely with professional grievances and a 
committee on anthropology as a profession 
(and, therefore, presumably focused primarily 
on nonacademic careers) not surprisingly pro­
posed a code which was avowedly responsive 
to the "new realities" of a changing profession 
and, especially , as has been repeatedly 
asserted, ro the circumstances of nonacademic 
anthropologists: those employed in govern­
ment and in corporate and consultative agen­
cies. But it was not only these two bodies that 
constructed the new code. According to the 
Newsletter's announcement of the draft code, 
"more than 60 members" of the association 
had already participated in composing the 
draft over a period of four years by the rime it 
was first published in October 1984 (Newslet­
ter, 1984:2). Everyone knows that a camel is 
a horse that was designed by a committee, as 
comedian Allan Sherman was wont to say, and 
this one was a super-committee. No wonder 
the result was a super-camel. The PPR was the 
result of a mere thirteen minds in over a year's 
time - a bit swaybacked and perhaps even of 
another color, but definitely the intended 
horse. 
Alexander Leighton has quoted a saying 
popular in government circles during World 
War II that uthe administrator uses social 
science the way a drunk uses a lamp post, for 
support rather than illumination'' (Leighton 
1949:128). The imperatives are different if one 
is providing policy support or if profits are rhe 
bottom line from a case in which one is seeking 

312 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
understanding. This is where the dCoE differs 
basically from the PPR, for the former is 
responsive to the needs of those who provide 
support; the latter to the needs of those who 
provide illumination. The letters in the 
columns of our newsletter make vivid the cir­
cumstances and ideologies that underlie both 
the demand for and the resistance to a revised 
code. One complains that the PPR 
established a set of standards so narrowly 
focused on a single environment that it 
excluded ... those of us who have chosen to 
work outside the grove .... Many institutions 
of government are charged with delivering 
specific services. The anthropologist can in 
many cases contribute to making that delivery 
more effective and humane. But in order to do 
so ... he or she ... must play by the rules of 
the game .... 
This is no less the case in the private sector 
where there are many organizations which 
exist to sell knowledge .... Thus, many of us 
are conducting research the results of which 
are proprietary ... they belong to the firm and 
are simply not available except at a price. 
In a similar vein the prohibition of secret 
research simply fails to rake into account the 
realities of today's world .... Anthropologists 
working in classified areas do so because they 
wish to influence national policy .... I 
welcome a Code of Ethics which considers 
such work a maner of personal choice. 
(Downs 1985:2) 
Another correspondence, from a different 
perspective, notes the increased population of 
anthropolo gists and the diminished availabil­
ity of "'classic' fieldwork experience," which 
raises critical problems, especially as anthro­
pologists get involved in "the commercial 
market, and when they begin to reassess their 
ethical codes." Now that government support 
is drying up, he continues, 
we must seriously question whether or not 
the accommod ation of individual economic 
incentives and the priorities of employment 
constitute an admittedly painful but critical 
confHct of interest for assessing the ethical 
directions for anthropolo gy. It is not an over­
simplified analogy ro note that the wilderness 
bears of North America have been reduced 
to garbage dump scavengers. What will a century of private marketing under such pri­
orities do to the ideals and perspectives for the 
practice of anthropology? 
... if anthropolo gy does not begin to secure 
some long-term analysis and planning, its 
ethical heritage will not sustain itself. (Wyoch 
1986:24) 
American anthropolo gy has had a tradition 
of ethical concern and social responsibility of 
which we can be proud. The revelation of 
mission-oriented, counteri nsurgency , and clas­
sified research and consultation undertaken by 
anthropologists working in Southeast Asia 
during the Vietnam War does not necessarily 
contradict this assessment. Such activities may 
well have been exceptional in the profession. 
Also, we must avoid the temptation to casti­
gate Southeast Asianist anthropologists as 
unusually insensitive to ethical issues. I do not 
think people with that regional specialization 
were more ready to sell out than others; only 
that they had unique opportunities and 
inducements to do so. Had American military 
adventurism been elsewhere, I am sure that 
some anthropolo gists would have stepped 
forward to do the dirty work there. But I 
believe such people are in a minority in our 
profession. The very fact that the ethical issues 
were raised, the unethical activities exposed 
and deplored, is evidence of the profession's 
social conscience. The involvement of anth­
ropologists in deplorable activities was not 
unusually pervasive, only unusually forth­
rightly condemned in the discipline. Other 
social scientists were doubtless equally or more 
frequently and deeply involved -political sci­
entists, for certain, perhaps psychologists, 
economists, sociologists, geographers -but 
their involvement may have been more taken 
for granted by their colleagues as acceptable 
professional behavior, for they were not called 
to account so forcefully, if at all. Thus, the very 
fact and manner of revelation of anthropolo­
gists' involvement reflects an alert professional 
conscience that is commendable. 
On the other hand, we cannot afford to be 
too self-congratula tory, either. We have had a 
tradition as well of complicity in colonial and 
neocolonial activity (Asad 1973; Lewis 1973 ), 
of advising exploiters of people and expropri-

ators of their resources. Those who disclaim 
this have to resort to generalized denial 
together with claims to extenuating values and 
behaviors held to be traditional and pervasive 
in the profession that in fact may prove to have 
been more often implicit than explicitly mani­
fest. For counterevidence they must rely on a 
very few individual and collective efforts in 
opposition to unethical activities, advocating 
and contributing to the cause of autonomy or 
emancipation of colonized and otherwise vic­
timized peoples (Maybur y-Lewis 1974). Nor 
can we deny the tendency in our association to 
overlook or sweep under the rug some of the 
most egregious of unethical involvements, 
while seeking to protect our collective reputa­
tion, as occurred in the instance described 
above of the expulsion of Boas by the council, 
replicated fifty years later by the effort of the 
Mead Committee to reprimand Wolf and 
Jorgensen both instances compnsmg 
responses to courageous but potentially embar­
rassing revelations of unethical behavior by 
fellow anthropo logists. On the positive side, 
we have the facts that the Mead Report was 
overwhelmingly rejected by the association 
and, of course, that the Principles of Profes­
sional Responsibility were enthusiastically 
adopted and seem still to be endorsed by an 
overwhelming majority of its members. 
It is worth remembering, too, that for nearly 
two years ( 1972-4 ), there was a Committee on 
Potentially Harmful Effects of Anthropologi­
cal Research (COPHEAR), appointed by the 
Executive Board at the direction of the mem­
bership as a result of a motion passed at the 
annual meeting of 1971 (AAA 1972:42; 
1973:23, 62; 1974:72).H When that committee 
died on the vine in 1974, primarily for want 
of cooperation and success in collecting infor­
mation sufficient to carry out its charge, there 
sprouted a proposal supported by many for a 
successor Committee on Ethnocide and Geno­
cide to address some of the same issues but 
without limiting itself to anthropological cul­
pability. This proposal was inexplicably 
dropped by the Executive Board shortly before 
the 1974 annual meetings. So far as I am 
aware, the important issues that it and 
COPHEAR were to have pursued have not 
been directly addressed in the association since then, but they did hold our attention for a 
time, and may again. 
Meanwhile, such issues have been the focus 
of several organizations and collectivities of 
dedicated anthropologists operating on finan­
cial shoestrings outside of the framework of 
the association. Most notable among them are 
Cultural Survival, the International Work 
Group for Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA), and 
the currently inactive Anthropolo gy Resource 
Center (ARC).9 Probably the most useful 
source of information on these and others of 
the sort is in the appendix titled "Organiza­
tions and Periodicals" in the second edition 
(and, I understand, the forthcoming third 
edition) of John H. Bodley's Victims of 
Progress (Bodley 1982:217-20). As an 
example I would cite Shelton Davis and Robert 
Mathews (and their Anthropolo gy Resource 
Center), who advocated and exemplified 
"public interest anthropology," which seems 
to be on a most positive track where ethical 
commitments and practicality are concerned: 
Public-i nterest anthropology differs from tra­
ditional applied anthropology in what is con­
sidered the object of study, whose interests the 
researcher represents, and what the researcher 
does with the results of his or her work. Public 
interest anthropology grows out of the demo­
cratic traditions of citizen activism rather than 
the bureaucratic needs of management and 
control. It is based on the premise that social 
problems-war, poverty, racism, sexism, envi­
ronmental degradation, misuse of technology 
- are deeply rooted in social structure, and the 
role of the intellectual is to work with citizens 
in promoting fundamental change. (Davis and 
Mathews 1979:5) 
Closely related to their stance is that of those 
who use the term "liberation anthropology" 
( Huizer 1979; cf. Frank 196 9) to describe their 
activist approach to helping achieve the eman­
cipation and autonomy of indigenous and 
other oppressed peoples -in analogy to the 
"liberation theology" of certain Christian 
clergy and lay people in Latin America (Berry­
man 1987). Bodley ( 1982:191-216) has 
proposed a useful typology of activist anthro­
pological approaches and those who employ 
them: the "Conservative-Humanitarian," the 

314 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
"Liberal-Politic al," and his own commitment, 
the "Primitivist-Environmentalist." I leave it to 
the interested reader to pursue the definitions 
and philosophies of these perspectives and 
their implications for, and iUuminations of, the 
ethical practice of anthropology. 
The recent impetus for redefinition of 
anthropological ethics comes clearly from 
those outside of academia who find the Prin­
ciples of Professional Responsibility to be 
inconsistent with the demands of their employ­
ment. Often calling themselves "practicing 
anthropologists ," they work primarily for cor­
porations, government agencies, and other 
mission-oriented employers whose priorities, 
they point out, are nor consistent with those 
confronted by scholar-anthropologists. 1° For 
them, anthropological ethics as heretofore 
defined are inconvenient, constraining, even 
threatening, both to their missions and to their 
careers. Corporate ends are profits; gov­
ernmental goals are national political, and 
international geopolitical, advantage. Anthro­
pologists have something of value to offer in 
the pursuit of these "real-world" ends, for they 
know about the peoples and cultures that will 
provide the work force and customers, the 
allies and adversaries. They know the populace 
that will decide the political and economic 
alignment of its government; who occupies the 
territory that contains the sought-after 
resources; and which will be the sites of the 
military bases and missile silos. As these cor­
porate and national priorities become anthro­
pologists' priorities, no wonder that the 
subjects of study no longer come first, that 
secrecy and even clandestinity are no longer 
condemned, that anthropologists become wary 
of being held accountable to their colleagues 
for the ethical practice of their profession, that 
they do not feel obliged to share with society 
as a whole the implications of their profes­
sional knowledge, and that they view the very 
concept of ethical standards with anxious 
skepticism. Anthropologists in these roles are 
agents of their employe rs, not advocates for 
those they study or for the principles of their 
profession. 
It is scarcely surprising , then, that the draft 
code, arising as it did in response to these cir­
cumstances, devotes nine of its new provisions 
to maners of "professional relations" and only four to the people among whom anthropolo ­
gists work, whether in practice or in research. 
This is a major reversal in direction from 
the focus of the Principles of Professional 
Responsibility. 
Evidently, a code of ethics for the era of 
practicing anthropology must not subordinate 
the requirements of the marketplace and 
realpolitik to mere adherence to principle. The 
question then is whether this draft code speaks 
for anthropologists as humane students and 
advocates of humankind, or as bureaucrats 
and human engineers. Are there to be two 
kinds of anthropologists, practicing and 
humanist; two kinds of ethics, practical and 
humane; two kinds of anthropology, laissez­
faire and principled? I think we should resist 
such a division as unnatural, unnecessary, and 
counterproductive. Resistance to it is in the 
public interest, in our professional interest , 
and in our individual interests. The demands 
and opportunities of careers in anthropol ogy, 
be they in practice or in academia , must not 
substitute for ethics. 
To the extent that anthropologists can 
remain true to their principles while practicing 
their profession outside of the academy, I 
would urge them to follow their career prefer­
ences and opportunities. To the extent that 
they cannot, I believe they must curtail their 
career choices. There is no place anywhere for 
unprincipled anthropology or anthropologists. 
Conclusion 
In conclus ion, let me emphasize that I am not 
opposed to revision of our code of ethics, the 
Principles of Professional Responsibili ty. I am 
opposed to the abandonment of the spirit of 
ethical practice of anthropology which it 
embodies, and the tenets which codify that 
spirit. Specifically, I am steadfastly opposed to 
compromise or elimination of what I believe 
to be the four fundamental principles of our 
ethics as anthropologists, all of which are 
prominent in the PPR and in the history of 
anthropology, and all of which are conspicu­
ously absent from the draft Code of Ethics 
which was proposed to replace it. They are 
well worth repeating: 

ETHICS VERSUS "REALISM " IN ANTHROPOLOGY 315 
(1) That "anthropologists' paramount 
responsibil ity is to those they study'' 
(PPR 1). 
(1} That "anthropologists should undertake 
no secret research" (PPR 3a) and "should 
avoid even the appearance of engaging in 
clandestine research" (PPR 3b). 
(3) That anthropologists are accountable for 
their professional actions: "when anthro­
pologists ... betray their professional 
commitments [as set forth in the PPR] 
... their colleagues may legitimately 
inquire into the propriety of those 
actions, and take such measures as lie 
within the legitimate powers of their 
Association as the membership deems 
appropriate" (PPR Epilogue). 
(4) That anthropologists bear "the positive 
responsibility to speak out publicly ... 
on what they know and ... believe as a 
result of their professional expertise .... 
That is, they bear a professional respon­
sibility to contribute to 'an adequate 
definition of reality' upon which public 
opinion and public poHcy may be based" 
(PPR 2d). 
I see the PPR as structurally analogous to the 
United States Bill of Rights or the Constitution 
as a whole: a basic document subject to review 
and revision by amendment proposed from the 
membership either directly or through its rep­
resentatives on the Executive Board, when rat­
ified by vote of the membership at large. But I 
believe it to be a drastic mistake for a com­
mittee to be appointed to create a substitute 
code, in toto, in response to what are said to 
be the changed realities of the moment -in this 
case, primarily changes in the anthropological 
marketplace. This is exactly what was done when the dCoE was proposed just ten years 
after the original code-the PPR- was drawn 
up and adopted. At this rate, our ethics would 
become simply fleeting reflections of the 
temper of the times, our code a weather vane 
shifting with every social and political wind, 
responsive to each economic fluctuation, polit­
ical fad, or international spasm. If this were to 
happen, we would not be alone. As the editor 
of New York magazine wrote not long ago, 
"Ethics in America seem to have dropped to 
one of the lowest points in history,, and 
"moral lapses blot American history .... But," 
she went on to point out, "today's go-go ethics 
are in many ways new. For one thing, there's 
little doubt that idealism is in decline and 
cynicism on the rise" (Kanner 1986:9). Surely 
anthropologists, as students of humankind, as 
practitioners of what Eric Wolf (1964:88) 
called "the most scientific of the humanities, 
the most humanist of the sciences," are more 
principled than to jump on that bandwagon; 
surely our ethical commitments are more pro­
found, independent, and stable than that; 
surely those among whom and in whose inter­
ests we work deserve better than that. 
In short, I believe the draft Code of Ethics 
constituted an evisceration of the PPR and, as 
such, betrayed our ethical principles and was 
unworthy of our discipline and our profession. 
It proposed to sacrifice the nobility of the pol­
itics of truth for the perversity of realpolitik. 
It seems that the era of Reaganomics spawned 
the nightmare of Reaganethics. I trust that 
history will soon be enabled by our profes­
sion's collective decision to relegate this 
episode to the dustbin of other short-lived 
aberrations of the 1980s.
