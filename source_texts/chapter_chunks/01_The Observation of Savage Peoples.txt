The Observation of 
Savage Peoples 
Joseph-Marie Degerando 
I Advertisement 
These considerations are addressed to Captain 
BAUDIN, correspondent of the society, about 
to leave for his expedition of discovery, and to 
the·various observers accompanying him; they 
are addressed also to Citizen LEVAILLANT , 
·who is going to attempt a third expedition in 
the interior of Africa. Since it is possible that 
both have occasion to encounter peoples at 
very different degrees of civilization or bar­
barity, it seems the right course to provide for 
any hypothesis, and to make these CONSID­
ERATIONS so general that they can be applied 
to any society differing in its moral and politi­
cal forms from those of Europe. The lead­
ing purpose has been to provide a complete 
framework comprising any point of view from 
which these societies can be envisaged by the 
philosopher. It has not been supposed that 
certain simple questions that can easily be fore­
seen should be omitted, when they were nec­
essary to the completeness of the whole. 
It seems astonishing that, in an age of 
egoism, it is so difficult to persuade man that 
of aU studies, the most important is that of 
himself. This is because egoism, like all pas­
sions, is blind. The attention of the egoist is 
directed to the immediate needs of which his 
senses give notice, and cannot be raised to those reflective needs that reason discloses to 
us; his aim is satisfaction, not perfection. He 
considers only his individual self; his species is 
nothing to him. Perhaps he fears that in pene­
trating the mysteries of his being he will ensure 
his own abasement, blush at his discoveries, 
and meet his conscience. 
True philosophy, always at one with moral 
science, tells a different tale. The source of 
useful illumination, we are told, like that of 
lasting content, is in ourselves. Our insight 
depends above all on the state of our faculties; 
but how can we bring our faculties to perfec­
tion if we do not know their nature and their 
laws? The elements of happiness are the moral 
sentiments; but how can we develop these 
sentiments without considering the principle 
of our affections, and the means of directing 
them? We become better by studying our­
selves; the man who thoroughly knows himself 
is the wise man. Such reflection on the nature 
of his being brings a man to a better aware­
ness of all the bonds that unite us to our 
fellows, to the re-discovery at the inner root of 
his existence of that identity of common life 
actuating us all, to feeling the full force of that 
fine maxim of the ancients: 'I am a man, and 
nothing human is alien to me.' 
But what are the means of the proper study 
of man? Here the history of philosophy, and

In

the common voice of learned men give reply. 
The time for systems is past. Weary of its cen­
turies of vain agitation in vain theories, the 
pursuit of learning has settled at last on the 
way of observation. It has recognized nature 
as its true master. All its art is applied in lis­
tening carefully to that voice, and sometimes 
in asking it questions. The Science of Man too 
is a natura] science, a science of observation, 
the most ·noble of alL What science does not 
aspire to be a natural science? Even art, which 
men sometimes contrast with nature, aims 
only to imitate her. 
The method of observation has a sure pro­
cedure; it gathers facts to compare them, and 
compares them to know them better. The 
natural sciences are in a way no more than a 
series of comparisons. As each particular phe­
nomenon is ordinarily the result of the com­
bined action of several causes, it would be only 
a deep mystery for us if we considered it on its 
own: but if it is compared with analogous phe­
nomena, they throw light each on the other. 
The particular action of each cause we see as 
distinct and independent, and general laws are 
the result. Good observation requires analysis; 
now, one carries out analysis in philosophy by 
comparisons, as in chemistry by the play of 
chemical affinities. 
Man, as he appears to us in the individuals 
around us, is modified at the same time by a 
multitude of varying circumstances, by educa­
tion, climate, political institutions, customs, 
established opinions, by the effects of imita­
tion, by the influence of the factitious needs 
that he has created. Among so many diverse 
causes that unite to produce that great and 
interesting effect, we can never disentangle the 
precise action that belongs to each, without 
finding terrms of comparison to isolate man 
from the particular circumstances in which he 
is presented to us, and to lift from him those 
adventitious forms under which, as it were, art 
has hidden from our eyes the work of nature. 
Now, of all the terms of comparison that we 
can choose, there is none more fascinating, 
more fruitful in useful trains of thought than 
that offered by savage peoples. Here we can 
remove first the variations pertaining to the 
climate, the organism, the habits of physical 
life, and we shall notice that among nations 
much less developed by the effect of moral institutions, these natural variations are bound 
to emerge much more prominently: being 
less distinguished by secondary circumstances, 
they must chiefly be so by the first and funda­
mental circumstances belonging to the very 
principle of existence. Here we shall be able to 
find the material needed to construct an exact 
scale of the various degrees of civilization, and 
to assign to each its characteristic properties; 
we shall come to know what needs, what 
ideas, what habits are produced in each era of 
human society. Here, since the development of 
passions and of intellectual faculties is much 
more limited, it will be much easier for us to 
penetrate their nature, and determine their 
fundamental laws. Here, since different gener­
ations have exercised only the slightest influ­
ence on each other, we shall in a way be taken 
back to the first periods of our own history; 
we shall be able to set up secure experiments 
on the origin and generation of ideas, on the 
formation and development of language, and 
on the relations between these two processes. 
The philosophical traveller, sailing to the ends 
of the earth, is in fact travelling in time; he is 
exploring the past; every step he makes is the 
passage of an age. Those unknown islands that 
he reaches are for him the cradle of human 
society. Those peoples whom our ignorant 
vanity scorns are displayed to him as ancient 
and majestic monuments of the origin of ages: 
monuments infinitely more worthy of our 
admiration and respect than· ·those famous 
pyramids vaunted by the banks of the Nile. 
They witness only the frivolous ambition and 
the passing power of some individuals whose 
names have scarcely come down to us; but the 
others recreate for us the state of our own 
ancestors, and the earliest history of the world. 
And even should we not see in savage 
peoples a useful object of instruction for our­
selves, would there not be enough high feelings 
of philanthropy to make us give a high impor­
tance to the contact that we can make with 
them? What more moving plan than that of 
re-establishing in such a way the august ties of 
universal society, of finding once more those 
former kinsmen separated by long exile from 
the rest of the common family, of offering a 
hand to them to raise them to a happier state! 
You who, led by a generous devotion on those 
far shores, will soon come near their lonely 

THE OBSERVATION OF SAVAGE PEOPLES 35 
huts, go before them as the representatives of 
all humanity! Give them in that name the vow 
of brotherly alliance! Wipe from their minds 
the memory of cruel adventurers who sought 
to stay with them only to rob or bring them 
into slavery; go to them only to offer benefits. 
Bring them our arts, and not our corruption, 
the standard of our morality, and not the 
example of our vices, our sciences, and not our 
scepticism, the advantages of civilization, and 
not its abuses; conceal from them that in these 
countries too, though more enlightened, men 
destroy each other in combat, and degrade 
each other by their passions. Sitting near 
them, amid their lonely forests and on their 
unknown shores, speak to them only of peace, 
of unity, of useful work; tell them that, in those 
empires unknown to them, that you have left 
to visit them, there are men who pray for their 
happineSs, who greet them as brothers, and 
who join with all their hearts in the generous 
intentions which lead you among them. 
In expressing here everything that we expect 
�f your careful and laborious work, we are far 
from wishing to underestimate the many ser­
up vices done to society by the explorers who 
nr. have gone before you. Had they merely pre-
pared the way, by their brave undertakings, for 
those who were to follow them, and provided 
valuable guidance, by that alone they would 
have earned a great title to our gratitude. But 
they began to establish some communication 
with savage societies; they have reported to 
us various information on the customs and 
language of these peoples. It is merely that, 
divided by other concerns, and with a greater 
impetus to discover new countries than to 
study them, constantly moving when they 
should have stayed at rest, biased perhaps by 
those unjust prejudices that cast a slur in our 
eyes on savage societies, or at least, witness of 
our European indifference for them, they did 
not sufficiently devote themselves to bringing 
back exact and complete observations; they 
have met the invariable end of those who 
observe in a precipitate and superficial manner 
-their observations have been poor, and the 
imperfection of their reports has been the 
penalty of our carelessness.1 Since man's curi­
osity is aroused more by the novelties that 
strike his senses than by any instruction that 
his reason may gather, it was thought far more worth while to bring back from these countries 
plants, animals and mineral substances, than 
observations on the phenomena of thought. So 
naturalists daily enriched their specimen cases 
with many genera, while philosophers spent 
time in vain disputes in their schools about the 
nature of man, instead of uniting to study him 
in the arena of the universe. 
Let us review the main faults of the obser­
vations on savage man made by these explor­
ers, and the gaps that they have left in their 
accounts. When we realize what they have not 
done, we shall see better what remains to be 
done. 
The first fault that we notice in the obser- Fir.;r fault. 
vations of explorers on savages is their incom­
pleteness; it was only to be expected, given the 
shortness of their stay, the division of their 
attention, and the absence of any regular tab-
ulation of their findings. Sometimes, confining 
themselves to the study of some isolated indi-
viduals, they have given us no information on 
their social condition, and have thus deprived 
us of the means of estimating the influence 
which these social relations might have on 
individual faculties. Sometimes, pausing on the 
smallest details of the physical life of the 
savages, they have given us scarcely any details 
of their moral customs. Sometimes, describing 
the customs of grown men, they have failed to 
find out about the kind of education received 
in childhood and youth: and above all, preoc-
cupied almost entirely with the external and 
overt characteristics of a people, of its cere-
monies and of its dress, they have generally 
taken too little care to be initiated in the far 
more important circumstances of its theoreti-
cal life, of its needs, its ideas, its passions, 
its knowledge, its laws. They have described 
forms rather than given instructive reports; 
they have marked certain effects, and 
explained scarcely any causes. 
Further, such insufficient observations have Set:ond f3ulr. 
not always been very certain or authentic, 
whether because they have sometimes been roo 
particular, and explorers have wished to judge 
a society by a few of its members, a character 
by a few actions, or because they have some-
times confined themselves to hearsay, to the 
stories of the Savages whom they met, and 
who perhaps were not properly understood, 
perhaps not welJ-versed in what was asked� 

36 JOSEPH-MARIE DEG�RANDO 
and perhaps had no interest in telling the truth, 
or at least in making it known in its entirety. 
Third fault. We should add that these observations have 
been badly ordered, and even in many cases 
quite without order. The explorers had not 
enough understood that there is a natural con­
nection between the various facts that one 
gathers about the condition and character of 
societies, that this order is necessary to the pre­
cision of the individual facts, and that often 
some of them should serve as preparati on for 
the others. We should study effects before 
trying to go back to first principles; observe 
individuals before trying to judge the society; 
become acquainted with domestic relations 
inside families before examining the political 
relations of society; and above all we should 
aim at full mutual understanding when we 
speak to men before basing certain conclusions 
on the accounts that we claim to have received. 
Fourth fault. Often explorers have based the accounts 
that they bring us on incorrect or at least on 
dubious hypotheses. For example, they habit­
ually judge the customs of Savages by analo­
gies drawn from our own customs, when in 
fact they are so little related to each other. 
Thus, given certain actions, they suppose 
certain opinions or needs because among us 
such actions ordinarily result from these needs 
or opinions. They make the Savage reason as 
we do, when the Savage does not himself 
explain to them his reasoning. So they often 
pronounce excessively severe judgments on a 
society accused of cruelty, theft, licentiousness, 
and atheism. It were wiser to gather a large 
number of facts, before trying to explain them, 
and to allow hypothesis only after exhausting 
the light of experience. 
Fihh fault. In the case of the accounts of explorers there 
is another cause of uncertain ty, a fault of lan­
guage rather than of imperfect observation, 
namely that the terms used to pass on to us the 
results of their observations are often in our 
own language of vague and ill-determined 
meaning. Conseque ntly, we are in danger of 
taking their accounts in a way which they did 
not intend. This happens particularly when 
they try to record the religious, moral, and 
political beliefs of a people. It happens too 
when instead of giving a detailed and cir­
cumstantial account of what they have actu­
ally seen, they limit themselves to summary descriptions of the impressions which they 
received, and of the general judgments which 
they inferred on the character of peoples. Yet 
this drawback could easily have been avoided 
by making it a policy either to describe things 
without judging them, or to choose expres­
sions whose sense is more agreed, or to give a 
precise stipulation of the sense in which one 
intends their use. 
This is not the place to enumerate the inac­
curacies springing from a lack of impartiality 
in explorers, from prejudices imposed by 
their particular opinions, from the interests of 
vanity or the impulse of resentment. The char­
acter of the worthy men today devoting them­
selves to this noble undertaking is a sufficient 
guarantee that such a stamp will never shape 
their accounts. But explorers with the purest 
and most honest intentions have often been led 
into error about the character of peoples by the 
behaviour they meet with. They have inferred 
too lightly from the circumstances of their 
reception, conclusions about the absolute and 
ordinary character of the men among whom 
they have penetrated. They have failed to con­
sider sufficiently that their presence was bound 
to be a natural source of fear, defiance, and 
reserve; that reasons of policy might exag­
gerate this unusual circumspecti on; that the 
memory of former attacks might have left dark 
prejudices in the mind of such peoples; that a 
community might be gentle and sociable, and 
yet believe itself in a state of natural war with 
strangers whose intentions are unknown; and 
finally that for a just estimate of the character 
of a tribe, one should first leave time for the 
reactions of astonishment, terror, and anxiety 
bound to arise in the beginning to be dispelled, 
and secondly one should be able to be initiated 
into the ordinary relations which the members 
of the community have with each other. Sl� 
fault 
But of all the regrets left by the accounts of 
the explorers who went before you, the faub 
strongest is their failure to tell us of the lan­
guage of the peoples visited. In the first place, 
the scanty information which they do give 
lacks precision and exactness, whether because 
they fail to record how they went about ques­
tioning the Savages, or because they them­
selv-es have often taken little care to pose the 
questions properly. The demonstrative and 
natural gestures which they have used to ask 

. ighth 
ult. THE-OBSERVATION OF SAVAGE PEOPLES 37 
the Savages the names of objects were often 
themselves liable to considerable uncertainty; 
one cannot know if those who were ques­
tioned understood the gestures in the same 
way as the explorers who were using them, 
and so whether they were giving proper replies 
to their questions. Further, to provide us with 
some useful and positive ideas of the idioms of 
savage peoples, it was wrong for explorers 
to limit themselves as they did to taking at 
random names of various objects with scarcely 
any relation between them; at least a family of 
analogous ideas should have been followed up, 
when it was impossible to make a record of 
the whole language, so that some judgment 
could be made on the generation of terms, and 
on the relations between them; it was not 
enough to be content with some detached 
words; but it would have been sensible to 
record whole sentences to give some idea of the 
construction of discourse. Further, one should 
have discovered whether these words were 
simple, or composite, as their length would 
often lead us to suppose; whether they were 
qualified by any articles or particles; and 
finally whether they were inflected or remained 
in the absolute, and whether they were liable 
to any kind of grammatical laws. 
Failing to acquaint themselves thoroughly 
with the idiom of savage peoples, explorers 
have been powerless to draw on perhaps the 
most interesting ideas that could have been 
available. They have been unable to pass on 
the traditions that such peoples may preserve 
of their origin, of the changes that they have 
undergone, and of the various details of their 
history; traditions which perhaps would have 
thrown great light on the important question 
of how the world was peopled, and on the 
various causes of the present state of these 
societies. They have been unable to explain 
the significance of a mass of ceremonies and 
customs which are probably no more than alle­
gorical; they have given us bizarre descriptions 
which tickle the idle curiosity of the many, but 
which offer no useful instruction to the philo­
sophically minded. Lacking the means to carry 
on connected conversation with such peoples, 
they have been able to form only very haz­
ardous and vague ideas of their opinions and 
notions; finally, they have been unable to 
provide us with these data, as revealing as they are abundant, that the langu.age of a society 
presents on its way of seeing and feeling, and 
on the most intimate and essential features of 
its character. 
The main object, therefore, that should 
today occupy the attention and zeal of a truly 
philosophical traveller would be the careful 
gathering of all means that might assist him to 
penetrate the thought of the peoples among 
whom he would be situated, and to account 
for the order of their actions and relationships. 
This is not only because such study is in itself 
the most important of all, it is also because it 
must stand as a necessary preliminary and 
introduction to all the others. It is a delusion 
to suppose that one can properly observe a 
people whom one cannot understand and with 
whom one cannot converse. The first means to 
the proper knowledge of the Savages, is to 
become after a fashion like one of them; and 
it is by learning their language that we shall 
become their fellow citizens. 
But if there is a marked lack of good 
methods even for learning well the languages 
of neighbouring civilized nations; if this study 
often requires much time and effort, what 
position shall we be in for learning the idioms 
of savage tribes, when there is no dictionary, 
no spokesman to translate to us, and no shared 
habits and common associations of ideas as in 
the case of the former languages, through 
which explanations can be made? Let us not 
hesitate to say that the art of properly study­
ing these languages, if it could be reduced to 
rules, would be one of the master-works of 
philosophy; it can be the result only of long 
meditation on the origin of ideas. We shall 
confine ourselves here to making some general 
remarks; the reflective thought of the enlight­
ened men to whom we address them will 
assure their development, and direct their 
application. 
The most important thing to observe in the 
study of the signs of Savages, is the order of 
the enquiry. 
[ ... ] 
We are aware that the totality of problems 
here posed for the explorer's wisdom calls for 
a huge amount of work, whether because of 
the number and the very importance of the 
questions, or the detailed and painstaking 
observations that each one demands. We are Observauom

Conclusion. 

38 JOSEPH-MARIE DEGERANDO 
aware that this work is surrounded by all 
kinds of difficulties, and that one must expect 
to meet great obstacles in the first relations 
that one wishes to establish with the Savages. 
For these peoples cannot penetrate the real 
intentions of those who approach them, they 
cannot easily distinguish their friends from 
their enemies, and those who bring help, from 
those who come to invade their territory. 
But we may rightly expect anything of the 
patience, the perseverance, and the heroic 
courage of the travellers to whom today we bid 
farewell; we are assured of it by their personal 
character, by the intentions animating them, by 
the dazzling proofs which they have already 
vouchsafed. Oh! What have they not already 
done for science, what noble course have they 
not already run! It was worthy of them still to 
defer its term, and to go on to complete so fine 
a work! Estimable men, as we salute you here 
on the eve of a departure soon to come, as we 
see you tear yourselves from your land, your 
family, and your friends, and leap beyond the 
limits of the civilized world; as we dwell on 
the thought of the fatigues, the privations and 
the dangers which await you, and of that long 
exile to which you have voluntarily con­
demned yourselves, our souls cannot resist a 
deep emotion, and the movement of sensibil­
ity in us is joined to the respect which we owe 
to so noble an undertaking. But our thought is 
settled in advance on the term of that under­
taking; and dwelling on this prospect, all our 
feelings are mixed in that of admiration and 
enthusiasm. lllustrious messengers of philoso­
phy, peaceful heroes, the conquests which you 
are going to add to the domain of science have 
more brilliance and value in our eyes than vic­
tories bought by the blood of men! All gener­
ous hearts, all friends of humanity join in your 
sublime mission; there is in this place more 
than one heart which envies you, which groans 
in secret that inflexible duties keep him on 
these shores, who would put his glory in 
following your path and your example. Our 
prayers at least will follow you across the 
Ocean, or in the lap of the desert; our thoughts 
will often be with you, when below the equa­
tor, or near the pole, you gather in silence pre­
cious treasures for enlightenment. We shall say 
to each other: 'On this day, at this hour, they 
are landing perhaps on an unknown land, they are perhaps penetrating to the heart of a new 
people, perhaps they are resting in the shade 
of antique forests from their long sufferings; 
perhaps they are beginning to enter into rela­
tions with a barbarous people, to eliminate its 
unsociable suspicions, to inspire in it a curios­
ity to know our ways and a desire to imitate 
them, and perhaps they are laying the founda­
tions of a new Europe.' Oh! who will tell in 
fact all the possible or probable results which 
may spring one day from these fine undertak­
ings? I speak here not only of our fuller spec­
imen cases, our more accurate and extensive 
maps, of our increased knowledge of the phys­
ical and moral history of the world, of the 
name of France taken to unknown shores! 
Think of the other bewitching prospects still 
offered to the reeling imagination! Trade 
extended by new relations; the navy brought 
to perfection by greater experience; jour­
neys made easier by discoveries; our political 
grandeur increased by new colonies or new 
alliances! Who can tell? Perhaps whole nations 
civilized, receiving from civilization the power 
to multiply themselves, and associate them­
selves with us by the ties of a vast confedera­
tion; perhaps broader and more useful careers 
open to human ambition, talent and industry; 
these peoples of Europe, daily contesting at 
the cost of their blood some narrow strip of 
land, expanding at pleasure in more beautiful 
terrain; perhaps a new world forming itself at 
the extremities of the earth; the whole globe 
covered with happier and wiser inhabitants, 
more equally provided for, more closely joined, 
society raising itself to more rapid progress by 
greater competition and reaching perhaps by 
these unexpected changes that perfection on 
which our prayers call, but to which our 
enlightenment, our methods, and our books, 
contribute so little! ... Vain chimerae perhaps; 
but chimerae to which our long unhappiness, 
our sad dissensions, and the sight of our cor­
ruption, yet give so much charm! ... At least 
it is certain that these brave enterprises, 
directed to the most obscure parts of the 
Universe, lay up for posterity a new future, 
and that it is only for the wisdom of our 
descendants to gather the abundant fruits of 
this· course that you are going to open. See 
how much the discoveries of Columbus 
changed the face of society, and what amazing 

THE OBSERVATION OF SAVAGE PEOPLES 39 
destinies bore that fragile vessel to which he 
trusted himself! It is true, this grand revolution 
has not all been to our advantage, still less to 
that of the peoples to whom it has given us 
access. But Columbus put in the New World 
only greedy conquerors; and you are proceed­
ing towards the peoples of the South only as 
pacifiers and friends. The cruel adventurers of 
Spain brought only destruction before them, 
and you will spread only good deeds. They 
served but the passions of a few men, and you aspire only to the good of all, to the glory of 
being of use! This glory, the sweetest, the 
truest, or rather the only true glory, awaits 
you, encompasses you already; you will know 
all its brilliance on that day of triumph and joy 
on which, returning to your country, wel­
comed amid our delight, you will arrive in our 
walls, loaded with the most precious spoils, 
and bearers of happy tidings of our brothers 
scattered in the uttermost confines of the 
Universe.
