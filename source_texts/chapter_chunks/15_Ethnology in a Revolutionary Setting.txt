Ethnology in a 
Revolutionary Setting 
June Nash 
There is a growing gulf between the anthro­
pologist's two roles, that of field researcher 
and that of analyst. In the first role, we share 
the lives of the people we study and identify 
with them in the conflicts they face (Gough, 
1968:4; Henry, 1966) as we "try the intimate 
experience of another upon ourselves to test 
our hypotheses'' (paraphrasing Levi-Strauss, 
1969:51). ln the second, we must objectify and 
distill our experiences. Ever since we discov­
ered that secrecy was a defense against the 
dominant culture, we have been increasingly 
aware that our data may be used against those 
whose lives we have shared. In the period 
of decolonization, as Maquet (1964:48) has 
shown, the anthropologist has come to be clas­
sified with the enemy. Even where national 
independence is established, our material can 
be and is being used to counter popular upris­
ings. The people we study are often cut off 
from the data we publish by a language or 
literacy block. Without our knowledge, our 
material may be fed directly to the "man in the 
field with the civic action program; working 
with a military establishment ... the person in 
psychological operations who has the basic 
fundamental studies that give him understand­
ing of the masses" (in the words of Dante B. 
Fascell, chairman of the House of Representa­
tives Subcomm ittee on Inter-American Affairs; 
see US Government, 1969). Since we have no official audience with statesmen or policy 
makers, we do not know how or whether our 
publications influence policies that will affect 
the lives of the people we study. Lacking 
control over the product of our research, we 
have lost the basis for social responsi bility. 
The issues raised by Project Camelot and 
the publication of the Thailand counter­
insurgency research reveal the need to set 
ethical standards within the profession Uor­
gensen, 1971, Wolf and Jorgensen, 1970). 
Berreman ( 196 8) has gone beyond the issue of 
professional standards to signal the danger 
of leaving the use of our data to others: 
"politicians and journalists," "madmen and 
scoundrels," as well as "statesmen and bene­
factors." Stavenhagen (1971) has called for 
.. decolonizing the profession." 
In order to work out an understanding of 
the role we can begin to play, we need account s 
of concrete field experiences such as those that 
Maquet (1964), Henry (1966), and Jones 
( 1971) have given us. This report provides a 
comparative instance based on my recent field 
experience in the revolutionary setting of 
Bolivia. In my previous fieldwork with the 
Maya of Chiapas, Mexico, the impact of 
modern change was only indirectly felt. The 
old power structure of curers and diviners 
who controlled the supernatural was breaking 
down, and men who had been protectors of

the community were being killed as witches. 
Hostility was turned inward, as a rising 
incidence of homicide within the community 
indicated. The defensive insulation of the 
community against the outside world pro­
tected me from the kinds of issues that arise in 
studying groups in the mainstream of change. 
People did not involve me in the witchcraft 
conflict that was the central struggle in their 
lives. 
In Bolivia it was not possible to choose the 
role of an impartial observer and still work in 
the tin mining community of Oruro, where I 
had gone to study ideology and social change. 
The miners, who spoke Quechua and or 
Aymara as well as Spanish, had entered the 
modem industrial sphere and were demanding 
power in it. The polarization of the class strug­
gle made it necessary to take sides or to be cast 
by them on one side or the other. In a revolu­
tionary situation, no neutrals are allowed. 
In the 146 years since Bolivia's indepen­
dence, there have been 186 uprisings, resulting 
in more than 150 changes of government. 
Only one of these movements resulted in 
the formation of a legitimized, democratica lly 
elected succession of leaders seeking structural 
changes that would warrant its being called a 
revolution: the uprising of the National Revo­
lutionary Movement (MNR) on April 9, 1952, 
when the people fought for the right to seat 
president-elect Victor Paz Estenssoro after he 
had been refused power by the oligarchy of tin 
barons. Eventually Paz lost the confidence of 
the masses who had supported him as he 
turned to a false "development, based on 
loans and increasing external control. In the 
convulsive spring (our fall) of 1964, workers' 
strikes and student protest led to his with­
drawal. Under the banner of the "revolution 
of reconstructi on," Rene Barrientos Ortuno, a 
general who had become Paz's vice-president 
under pressure from the army, took advantage 
of the rebellion. Reneging on the promises he 
had made to labor, he instituted four years of 
the worst repression Bolivia had suffered since 
the days of the "Butcher" Mamerto Urrio­
lagoitia, installed in the presidency by the tin 
oligarchy in 1948. 
When I arrived in La Paz in July 1967, Che 
Guevara was still fighting in the tropics of 
Santa Cruz. Barrientos's troops had massacred 87 men, women, and children in Siglo XX 
Catavi on June 23. The massacre was precipi­
tated by the Congress of Miners' Unions 
planned for the following day and was possi­
bly an attempt to discourage workers from 
supporting Che Guevara' s guerrilla movement. 
I took a bus to the old mining center of Oruro, 
where I found the San jose mine paralyzed by 
the reorganization of the mines according 
to plans proposed by the Inter-American 
Development Bank as a condition of its loan 
to the National ized Mining Corporation of 
Bolivia. The corporation had just fired over 
200 women who had worked in the concen­
tration of metals and replaced them with men 
and machines. I spoke to only a few people on 
my first visit, a teacher in the company school, 
who sympathized with the workers and told 
me some of their problems; a woman in chola 
�ess (the sign of transition from an Indian 
culture to urban life) selling candy and fruit 
punch to miners as they came off their shift; 
and a gatekeeper who was no longer able to 
work inside the mines due to silicosis, the 
"professional illness" of miners, but all of 
them spoke bitterly of the government and the 
nationaliz ed administration. I read the writing 
on the walls of all the company buildings 
calling for the "fight against imperialism" and 
death to the military assassins and parasites," 
signed with the initials of the various political 
parties and union federations. In large red 
letters, dripping from the hastily executed 
inscription, the word LIBERACION domi­
nated the walls of the company store. It was 
as though the cry of the French Revolution 
for "liberty, equality , and fraternity" had been 
reduced to its minimal demand -liberty to 
work out their own destiny. I was determined 
to return to this place that revealed, even in 
such a short visit, the turbulence of a society 
holding on to a precarious niche in an indus­
trial empire at the same time as it was trying 
to come to grips with an imposed system of 
exploitation. 
I returned to Bolivia for a summer field 
session in June 1969 to study the ideology of 
tin-miners. Barrientos had died in an air crash 
two months before, and his vice-president, 
Luis· Adolfo Siles SaJinas, had scheduled an 
election for May, 1970. Most of the mines 
were running, as they had for several years, at 

ETHNOLOGY IN A REVOLUTIONARY SETTING 225 
a loss, decapitalized by inefficient manage­
ment and the transfer of capital into military 
equipment. Pensioned workers were not 
receiving subsistence checks that, even when 
they arrived, could not cover food costs. 
Government-employed teachers had not been 
paid for months. Union leaders were in hiding 
or exile, and "yellow" unions were serving as 
spies for the management. Mining police 
received more pay than miners. Their job was 
to catch jucos, usually employed miners, who 
entered deserted shafts at night and "stole" 
what they considered to be their national 
riches. Many of the older engineers felt that 
productivity would increase and costs decrease 
if the police were fired and the company 
bought the metal the jucos extracted. 
I spent an afternoon in the local office of the 
mine management, waiting for permission 
from L:a Paz to go ahead with my study. I had 
already spoken to some of the officials in La 
Paz, but the administrator of the San jose 
mines wanted direct communication from 
them. When the assistant to the manager of 
industrial relations finally received a telegram 
approving the project, he went far beyond 
what I had requested in the way of coopera­
tion and arranged for me to conduct interviews 
in the anteroom of his office. Furthermore, he 
ordered the superintendent of mines to send 
miners to be interviewed when they finished 
work. I felt I couldn't refuse without arousing 
suspicion, so I started interviews on work 
conditions under these trying circumstances, 
where the assistant manager could hear every­
thing that was said and where the men, tired 
after a day's work, were compelled to talk with 
a strange gringa. 
One of the first miners I interviewed 
demanded that I explain what my study was 
about before he replied to my questions. I liked 
his forthright attitude and explained in detail. 
He seemed satisfied and spoke with interest 
and involvement. Another of the interviewees 
who impressed me in these early interviews 
was a watchman who, like all the others 
working in nonskilled jobs at the surface, 
could no longer work inside the mine because 
of silicosis. Since his duties were not pressing, 
he came by twice in the following week. He 
was more relaxed when I asked questions 
about ritual and folklore than when I ques-tioned him about conditions in the mine. Once 
he brought up the massacres that had taken 
place in the mines, his tone turned from bit­
terness to compassion for the dead and he 
wept as he spoke of the massacre of December 
21, 1942 in Siglo XX Catavi. Tears came to 
my eyes as he spoke of "our history" and of 
how Maria Barzola, a woman worker in the 
concentration of metal had seized the Bolivian 
flag during the march to the administrative 
offices to demand "more daily bread" and had 
been shot along with other men, women, and 
children by the soldiers called to the defense of 
the mine. Soon after that he and some of the 
other miners I had met in the course of my 
interviews invited me to their homes, and I 
could avoid the restrictive atmosphere of the 
adminis trative office. I think I had passed some 
kind of test that allowed me to go beyond a 
barrier to communication, a barrier that might 
never have been withdrawn, if I had remained 
a "stranger" (however desirable some ethnol­
ogists believe this to be [cf. Jarvie 1969]). 
I was visiting in the mine one day when I 
heard that an agent of the Department of 
Criminal Investigation (DIC) had come to 
investigate what I was doing. When I returned 
to the house where I rented rooms, I found all 
my notes and tapes removed. I later learned 
that my student had taken them in a laundry 
sack to a friend's house in the mining commu­
nity, but I had a few bad hours reflecting on 
the danger my notes could bring to my infor­
mants. The agent returned, and (remembering 
U Nu's "tension-releasing lunches" with his 
cabinet from my Burmese days of fieldwork), 
I invited him for breakfast the following day. 
That afternoon I received a call from one of 
my miner friends, who had begun an autobi­
ography. He had heard the DIC was after me 
and was curious to know what had happened. 
I assured him that I would not let the DIC see 
any of his work, and said that I would burn it 
first if there was any danger. He protested 
against such drastic action; it made me feel 
good that he had confidence in me and was 
committed to the work we were doing. That 
evening we gave all the notes to a student 
who was traveling to La Paz retaining only a 
few myths and folk tales to show the DIC. 
The agent arrived promptly the following 
morning and waited for us to return from the 

226 JUNE NASH 
anniversary mass of a friend's deceased 
mother. After we had chatted about folklore 
and rituals, he went on to tell us about his 
student days at the University of Wisconsin, 
where he said he had had a scholarship to 
study "counterinsur gency," and about his 
friendship with an American CIA agent 
working in Oruro. Then he left, after asking 
only to see our passports, although on the 
previous day he had demanded that we show 
him all our notes. 
Political campaigns for a presidential elec­
tion were underway when I left Bolivia in 
September. The Mayor of La Paz, Armando 
Escobar Uria, was gaining popularity as a can­
didate. I was not surprised to read shortly after 
that Alfredo Ovando, who had helped Barri­
entos attain power and who had littJe reason 
to believe that he could win a democratic 
election, had seized power on September 26. 
Desiring to outdo Siles, who had been promis­
ing to revise the oil code to increase the 
national share of the wealth of the American 
holdings in Santa Cruz, he nationalized the oil 
company. Economically , it would have been 
preferable ro await the installation of a gas line 
to Argentina' s markets, but the move was die­
rated by the political urgency of stabilizing a 
weak military coup. Yielding to pressure from 
intelJecruals and workers, Ovando freed some 
of the jailed union directors, who returned to 
work in the mines. When I returned to Bolivia 
in January, 1970, I sensed the uncertainty 
that Ovando's moves had created among 
the miners. Some calJed for a position of 
acerquismo, getting closer to the center of 
power, by supporting Ovando and trying to 
influence policy. Others distrusted the attempts 
of what they felt was an opportunistic regime, 
still dominated by the military, to gain support 
among the masses. Wages and contracts cut in 
half by Barrientos in 1965 in a "temporary" 
austerity measure, remained at the same low 
level, a linJe under a dolJar a day. 
Labor had begun ro rebuild its shattered 
organization. I visited the new secretary­
general and presented my credentials and plan 
for a study of the mining community. (I had 
avoided the former representative because of 
the low esteem the miners had for him and 
their suspicion that he was a spy for manage­
ment.) In April I attended a weeklong congress 
of the Federation of Mine Workers' Unions at Siglo XX Catavi, where old leaders and new 
gathered for the first time in five years to plan 
a program of action and elect a directorate. I 
was permitted to attend all of the sessions and 
to tape record the proceedings, except for 
those of the political commission. The regu­
lar attendance of myself and two assistants 
became something of a joke. It seemed too 
obvious a stunt for the CIA to pull -having a 
"blond" gringa sitting in front of a nearly all­
male audience with a large paisley-covered 
tape recorder. For those with lingering doubts 
about my presence, it might even have been 
appealing that they had their own specially 
assigned agent bugging them. I felt that imme­
diate feedback was essential to justify my pres­
ence to the miners, and so I wrote some of 
my impressions in an article published in 
Temas Sociales entitled "El XIVe Congreso y 
.Despues." In the months that followed, the 
union leadership concentrated on regaining the 
ground lost in the Barrientos period. The direc­
tors formulated a plan for reinstating wages 
at the pre-Barrientos level without producing 
inflation that had crippled the MNR govern­
ment before currency stabilization in 1956. 
Their plan involved eliminating many of the 
bureaucratic and technical posts that had accu­
mulated as the army invaded the administra­
tion and abolishing the mining police. Only 
one strike was called, and that was to demand 
replacements for machinery and tools in the 
mines. By the fall (our spring) of 1970, 
Ovando's government was beginning to swing 
farther to the right. The promised wage 
increase was not forthcoming and increased 
expenditures were made for armaments. One 
of the few left-of-ce nter critics in the govern­
ment, Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz, resigned 
from the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum in 
protest on May 18th. It wasn't just protest 
directly on mines wages but on a whole swing 
to right. He later revealed Ovando' s intention 
of replacing all the civilian mini sters with mil­
itary men (Presencia, july 7, 1970). The only 
other civilian minister of the left, Kidrich 
Bailey, was forced to resign soon after. The 
union leaders alerted the workers to this swing 
to the right in the cabinet and called for an 
antiimperialist demonstration. 
In the middle of July university students sent 
out a call to mobilize the National Army of 
Liberation, the guerrilla movement left over 

ETHNOLOGY IN A REVOLUTIONARY SETTING 227 
from the Che Guevara period, in Teoponte, 
and scores of students went there in the guise 
of literacy brigades. The 68 guerrillas were 
quickly defeated. As they were surrendering to 
the army, they were shot. Prisoners, some of 
them wounded, were killed with machine gun 
fire and hand grenades. Ovando refused to 
hand over the bodies of the victims to their 
families, perhaps, as rumor had it, because the 
thoroughly destroyed bodies revealed the bru­
tality of the military operation. Not only rela­
tives of the dead and political sympathizers, 
but many of the Bolivian people were outraged 
by this callous behavior. Other sectors of 
the middle class were alienated by Ovando's 
imprisonment and expulsion of priests in the 
middle of September. 
A series of demonstrations in La Paz by uni­
versity students protesting the government's 
bizarre handling of the dead guerrillas culmi­
nated in a march on September 21, the Day of 
Students. Usually a day for celebration of 
youth, when students crown their queens and 
dance, that year it was a day for-·rebellion 
against a regime that was falling into the old 
pattern of ineptness and repression of the 
resulting discontent. Union directors joined the 
students in a symbolic funeral of the dead 
guerrillas. Although the miners had rejected 
the movement when it was active, they pro­
claimed its martyrs when they were no longer 
a threat to their trade union aims. The streets 
for blocks around the university were still filled 
with the tear gas used to break up the demon­
stration when I passed by several hours later. 
My taxi driver said bitterly, "Each one of those 
bombs costs us $U.S. 10, and look what they 
do with them!" As I waited to meet a founda­
tion representative in the lobby of one of the 
few luxury hotels in La Paz, I was appalled to 
overhear some of my compatriots, attending a 
medical convention, joking about this latest of 
Bolivia's revolutions. I wondered how anyone 
could laugh at people prepared to die rather 
than continue selling their lives everyday in a 
market over which they had no control. 
The weeks following were a time of near 
anarchy. Ovando' s government had lost its 
legitimacy. The big question was: When will it 
end? 
The union in San Jose and other mining 
centers built up its antiimperialist campaign in 
these weeks of guerrilla action and student protest. The campaign came to focus more and 
more on Yanqui imperialism. Finally, I became 
the target. On October 3, Doris Widerke hr, 
who was beginning her dissertation research, 
went to tape a union meeting, as we had been 
doing for a special study of the rhetoric of 
worker organizations. She came back shaken 
and upset. One of the former leaders, who was 
himself accused by some of being a CIA agent 
had asked why we were allowed to tape the 
sessions and why we were doing the study. 
(Since I had had several conversations with 
him about the work we were doing, this 
seemed a tactic for diverting suspicion from 
himself.) The question had opened a general 
discussion of our role in the mining center. 
Three strangers from Argentina, one of whom 
claimed to be an anthropologist had said that 
they never used tape recorders in their work 
and that furthermore anthropologists need 
only 3 months for a field study and we had 
already been there 10 months. Doris had been 
asked to leave. 
We discussed the events of the meeting with 
my compadre, a retired miner, during lunch. 
He advised me not to get angry when eating 
because the bile would burst and I might die. 
I tried to control my anger until the afternoon, 
when I went to see the secretary-gen eral. For­
tunately he was not there. Since I had not yet 
worked out a plan of action, I then went to see 
another of my compadres, who was a delegate 
with the union. He consulted with a compadr e 
who had many years of experience in labor 
struggles, and they decided that I should draft 
a letter explaining my problem and methods 
of investigation in detail and distribute copies 
to all the delegates as well as to the secretary 
general, asking for an audience at the next 
meeting. I had, of course, discussed my work 
with the union before and had given the 
secretary- general copies of the articles I had 
published in Spanish, but changes in the union 
and in the political scene seemed to have made 
a reevaluation necessary. The strategy they 
outlined for me was to involve all of the men 
responsible for the operation of the union in 
the discourse, avoiding personal commitments 
to a single individual, who could then be sus­
pected of being in complicity with me. I 
drafted the letter and revised it in accordance 
with comments from my compadre. The fol­
lowing day I passed out copies of the letter to 

228 JUNE NASH 
the delegates as they were leaving a meeting 
concerned with an attempted coup in La Paz. 
The coup had begun on the morning of 
October 4, while Ovando was in Santa Cruz, 
with a radio-broadcast mandate signed by 
64 officers calling for his renunciation of the 
presidency. 
The following seven days have been called 
"The Week of the Generals" (Samuel 
Mendoza, Presencia, November 15, 1970). In 
the course of the week, six presidents entered 
and left the "Burned Palace." The contest 
became something like a football game 
between sectors of the armed forces, with the 
people listening to the radio with consterna­
tion, dismay, and a wild sense of the absurd as 
generals kicked the football of power from one 
to another . 
Because I had not yet cleared up the ques­
tion of whether I was an agent for the CIA, I 
did not go out except for brief trips to the 
plaza to see if any of the student demonstra­
tions announ ced on the radio were taking 
place. A new group of DIC agents had taken 
possession of one of the benches in the plaza. 
I discovered their identity when I was about 
to rake a photograph of soldiers massing near 
the Cathedral to block a scheduled student 
demonstration and one of the plainclothes 
agents rushed over to stop me, saying I had no 
right to photograph secret agents. 
On Monday, October 5, as a result of the 
only "election" in two years, held in the 
Miraflores barracks, officers of the army called 
for Ovando (who had by now returned to the 
Palace) to renounce the presidency "for having 
defrauded the hopes of the people." General 
Rogelio Miranda, who had led the coup could 
not muster strong support even within the 
army, so he named a triumvirate to take 
control. Students and workers rallied behind 
General juan jose Torres, as the least imperi­
alist, least Fascist, and least reactionary of the 
lot, to oppose the trio. When a strike was 
threatened for the following day, the tide 
turned against the triumvirate. Torres was pro­
claimed president on the afternoon of October 
6. He promised to form a government based 
on campesinos (agricultural workers), miners 
and factory workers, and university students, 
with the support of the army, the various min­
istries to be divided among these four sectors of the population. The representatives of the 
Bolivian Workers' Central (COB) at first 
rejected the plan of coparticipation, on the 
basis of their experience with the MNR gov­
ernment and criticism of the compromises 
resulting from that episode, but later agreed 
to accept the posts of Housing, Mines, and 
Labor. Torres's attempts to find a popular base 
for his new government threatened a rebellio n 
if labor were to have as much participation in 
government as Torres had promised them. 
Fearing the seizure of power by the rightist 
wing, the Political Command of the COB 
agreed to leave the new president at liberty to 
choose his cabinet without including them. 
Meanwhile, Doris and I had made prepara­
tions in case of an attack on the Anglo­
American-owned apartment building in which 
we lived. I took my daughter to stay at the 
house of a friend. We took suitcases of notes to 
the house of another friend and copies to still 
another. Then we shuttered the windows and 
listened to the radio. That night it looked as 
though the crisis was over, and we celebrated 
the assignment of ministerial posts assigned to 
labor leaders, some of whom we knew. 
The Workers' Central of the Department of 
Oruro had planned a strike and an anti-fascist 
demonstration in Oruro on October 7, with 
participation by miners from other centers 
as well as San Jose. From the window of a 
dentist's office that morning, I watched a 
crowd of young men converging on the ofiices 
of the DIC. The guards ran up to the roof with 
machine guns, but they did not fire on the 
crowd below, whether because of cowardice or 
good judgment I do not know. The youths 
came out carrying rifles. (We later discovered 
that the guns had no firing pins, but they 
looked menacing at the time.) Not far away, 
students were assaulting the U.S. Information 
Service building, where the doors of the library 
were bombed open and books and materials 
carried off or burned. 
When I returned home, our cook told me 
that she had just bought a can of oil in the 
market when one of her neighbors pointed a 
rifle at her and tried to seize it. He did not rec­
ognize her until she screamed, "Don Roberto, 
what are you doing?" and then he let go of the 
can. Shortly after, one of the university stu­
dents came with news of the assault on the 

ETHNOL OGY IN A REVOLUTIONARY SmiNG 229 
USIS. He brought tear gas bombs and a vomit 
bomb, plainly marked US Army, that he had 
liberated from the DIC office and gave them 
to us in case the Anglo-American school, as the 
only symbol of US imperialism left, should be 
the next target. I was beginning to get irritated 
at some of the "revolutionary" tactics of the 
mob, and I didn't want to leave without at 
least some show of resistance. I felt that, while 
1 had to demonstrate that not all Americans 
were imperialis ts, I also had to make them 
realize that not all actions in the name of rev­
olution were revolutionar y. 
There was nothing to do but sit in the shut­
tered living room listening to the transistor 
radio, with the bombs close at hand. Radio 
Universidad announced the arrival of truck­
loads of miners from Machacamarca. Others 
from Catavi and Siglo XX were expected to 
join them for the afternoon demonstration. 
Suddenly a volley of shots was fired into the 
unarmed crowd in front of the central bar­
racks. Whether it was triggered when civilians 
approached the door of the barracks; as some 
said or when a woman, hit by an orange peel 
thrown at the guards, screamed, is not verified. 
For the next eight hours there ensued a useless 
battle with random sniping, resulting in about 
20 deaths and 100 injuries. Between desperate 
calls for a return to sanity radio announcers 
broadcast the lists of wounded and dead. 
The teenage son of a miner came to visit us. 
He wanted to go out in the streets to see what 
was happening, but I made him help me bake 
a cake. When it was done, I wanted to invite 
Doris, who lived across the street, to join us 
for tea, but the moment we opened the door a 
volley of bullets from a sniper sitting on a 
nearby hill discouraged us. I made the teenager 
stay overnight for fear that he would be shot 
going home to the mine. In the morning his 
parents arrived looking for him. As I had 
feared they had thought he was in the hospi­
tal or the morgue and had made the rounds 
early in the morning and seen the dead and suf­
fering. However , they agreed that the precau­
tion had been worth their night of anxiet y. In 
the afternoon of the following day, we went to 
the wake of eight students and youths in the 
university auditorium and then to the mine 
office, where three workers who had died were 
on view. Thousands came to pay their last respects and then attended the mass funeral on 
the following day. The speakers tried to make 
of the deaths a noble sacrifice for the revolu­
tion, but the people knew that they were due 
to nothing more than the stupidity and inept­
ness of the command of the armed forces. 
In the following days people waited and 
watched the new officials. The DIC office was 
still occupied by students, who had put a like­
ness of Che Guevara in guerrilla fatigues on 
the pillar in the entryway. They soon acquired 
a reputation of being as arbitrary in their han­
dling of cases as their predecessors. One of the 
miners told us that a fight had broken out in 
his family and everyone was detained in the 
cold cells without cots or plumbing facilities, 
even his 15-year-old daughter (who, as a 
minor, should not have been imprisoned ). In a 
country that lives with the constant expecta­
tion of revolution, there is little preparation for 
a successful outcome. During this period, there 
was relative freedom of expression in the press 
and on the radio. Union leadership was given 
full liberty to pursue the plans for the res­
titution of wages. There was no evidence of 
restraint or recrimination against any of the 
combatants. 
A week after my accusation, 1 went to ask 
the secretary- general for time to explain my 
work to the delegates. He agreed to give me 
some time in the next meeting. In my presen­
tation, I stressed that the tape recorder was a 
tool to get more accurate data and not an 
instrument of espionage. One of the delegates 
told me that the suspicion had arisen when I 
had lent the tape recorder to one of the dele­
gates to a COB conference. Though the title of 
the tape on the machine had been erased, the 
tape itself had not and it contained accusations 
by one of the members against some of the 
directors. The delegate had played the tape for 
the other delegates to the conference and let it 
be known that it was mine. I was dismayed at 
what I had let happen after all my care, and 
assured them it was an error of stupidity and 
not evil intention. They seemed prepared to 
believe this. Despite their hatred of the CIA, 
they had a very high regard for the agency's 
performance, and this blunder did not fit the 
image. I felt that they had accepted my contin­
ued stay in the community when the direc­
torate's intellectual advised me how I could 

230 JUNE NASH 
improve and amplify the study by investigating 
work conditions of the women on the slag pile. 
The episode, although disturbing and threat­
ening the very possibility of continuing my 
work, yielded some ethnographic benefits. 
Enemies of the leadership became friendly to 
me when I was cast as an enemy of their 
enemy. They told me of the leaders' attempts 
to gain favor with the administration and 
described the circle of llunkus, men who curry 
favor with those in power, that surrounded 
each of them. They spoke more frankly of their 
own fear of being deceived by their leaders, the 
ever-present fear of the powerless. I learned of 
the corrupt union leader's technique of taking 
issues from the management, and introducing 
them as union demands, such as constructing 
additions to social service buildings (projects 
that meant a lor of graft), I discovered that I 
had been under almost constant surveillance 
by a neighbor whose husband worked in the 
mine, and that her report of my visitors' being 
only workers from the rank and file reassured 
the people that my interest in the mine stem­
med from genuine sympathy. ln the week of 
my own "suspension" I came to understand 
more fully the insecurity that robs working 
people of their revolutionary zeal. 
Several days after my meeting with the 
union delegates, I saw the jeep station wagon 
put at the disposal of the union by the 
company raising a cloud of dust behind me as 
I walked dovm the road. StiU not sure how 
they had taken my defense, I jumped into the 
ditch to avoid being run down; much to my 
surprise, rhe driver pulled up to me and the 
secretary-ge neral asked me if I would like a 
ride. I was too overcome ro think of an excuse, 
so I agreed, but I recovered my defense enough 
to decline a drink of chicha (the fermented 
drink of the workers}. At that point I was 
afraid of being seen with him and his 1/unkus. 
The next time I showed up at a union meeting, 
two of my compadres came over and greeted 
me, using the formal address of comadre, thus 
establishing the relationship publicly. Later, 
when a newcomer who was trying to gain 
footing in the union tried to intercept my 
taking a photograph of two children listening 
in to the discussion at a meeting, two other 
friends came over and asked him what he 
thought he was doing. Aher the meeting a man invited me to be comadre of the soccer team. 
I could hardly refuse, although it meant buying 
socks for the 13 members. 
Torres visited the San jose mines in Decem­
ber, just after the announ cement that the wage 
raises would go into effect in January . The 
crowd of 200 or so miners who came to the 
stadium to listen to him applauded his speech 
but saved most of their vivas for the working 
class and the martyrs of the union struggles. 
The president called for confidence in his gov­
ernment and the good will of the armed forces, 
and he pleaded for peace to work out a program 
for economic improvement. "You have fought 
enough,., he told the miners, "in the war of 
Nancahuasu and when Maria Barzola marched 
and sacrificed her life asking for more bread for 
the workers "; the miners responded with a call 
for arms for the workers. Miners have learned 
that the words of presidents have little value 
unless they have confidence enough in the 
workers to give them we a pons. 
I left in December feeling somewhat opti­
mistic about the future of the mines. When 
I returned in July, 1971, to make a film 
based on the miner's autobiography mentioned 
earlier, there was a new secretary-general, for­
merly a leader in Siglo XX who had been jailed 
during Barrientos's term of office. When he 
had been elected in December , one of the 
superintendents expressed relief that he had 
won over the more Marxist-revolutionary can­
didates, since he had a good reputation as a 
foreman concerned with production. He had 
already aroused some criticism from the rank 
and file for getting employment in the mines 
for members of his extended kin group. Fur­
thermore, newspaper articles implicated him 
in the torture and slaying of a union leader 
during Ovando's period of office. The last 
thing he needed was a gringo working in the 
mines. He agreed to let me show the Super-8 
film we had made the year before. I had looked 
forward to this as an opportun ity of telling 
people in the mining community about the 16-
m.m film we proposed to do. When I arrived at 
the union hall, the order to permit the showing 
of the film had not been given. I sensed that I 
was going to have some opposition from offi­
cial union sources in making the film and con­
tinuing my work, although my friends and 
compadres were cooperative throughout. 

ETHNOLOGY IN A REVOLUTIONARY SETTING 231 
There had been a marked shift to the left in 
the Torres government. Two or more attempted 
coups in january (one by Hugo Banzer, who 
was to carry out the successful coup in August) 
had been put down with the help of miners. 
The right was on the defensive or in flight. 
The PopuJar Assembly , a kind of forum of 
union leaders, campesin os, and left politicians, 
opened in June. Ideologies and programs of the 
left were aired in what Presencia (August 6, 
1971) referred to lyrically as a "symphony for 
the revolution ." The main business of the 
Assembly became the working out of the details 
of coparticipation of workers in the adminis­
tration of mines and factories. Workers in 
the mining center were doubtful about the 
program, since they felt that in the coparticipa­
tion phase of the MNR regime the union lead­
ership had lost its revolutionary aims as it 
learned to participate in the spoils of the 
company. At an August meeting in San jose 
mine, the director was unable to secure a 
quorum, and those present began to whistle and 
protest that the leaders had not come to advise 
them about the plan for coparticipation. The 
director turned to me and ordered me to go, 
thereby diverting the workers from their protest 
and eliminating a witness of the breakup of 
the meeting for lack of a quorum. After the 
meeting, rank-and-file members told me resent­
fully that they were again being used as "steps'' 
in the rise of opportunistic labor leaders. 
During July and August there were inva­
sions of agricultural and business enter­
prises. Miners seized private holdings in 
Colquecharca, Postosi, and Catavi. Peasants 
seized the homes of the hacendados (estate 
owners) for whom they worked. Some of the 
presses and radio stations were taken over by 
the men who worked in them or by popular 
pressure groups and were turned into cooper­
atives. There was an air of apprehensiveness 
and expectation; people stood in their door­
ways, watching to see the next development, 
just as they did in the week of Carnival waiting 
for the dancers to come in. When I went to the 
University of Oruro's library on the morning 
of August 7, pensioned miners who had been 
on a hunger strike to gain their subsistence 
money surged into the building, which had 
once been the residence of a tin baron. As the 
men and women pressed into the main hall of the baroque mansion, shorter than I by a head, 
stunted by years of malnutrition and shaken 
with the racking cough of silicosis, I felt the 
full impact of the revolutionary pressures in an 
economy hedged in by foreign powers that did 
not have to yield to their demands. 
In the early days of August, rumors of mil­
itary plots originating in Santa Cruz led to the 
demand for arms for the people to "defend 
their revolution and take positive steps toward 
socialism" (Presencia, August 8, 1971 ). On 
August 14, union directors in Santa Cruz 
advised Torres of subversion in their capital. 
Torres failed to act, but the military began to 
prepare themselves; on August 16, students 
in the military college were assigned to the 
central barracks without any official explana­
tion. The union leaders of Santa Cruz sent 
more urgent messages, and both union leaders 
and the Popular Assembly in Cochabamba 
asked for arms for the workers. On August 20, 
Hugo Banzer and 38 coconspirators were 
imprisoned. After a day of demonstrations in 
favor of his release, Banzer was set free and 
began to mobilize rebel forces. 
In Oruro, miners were mobilizing from Siglo 
XX, Catavi, Huanuni, and Santa Fe to fight 
the rebels. On the morning of the 1Oth, union 
leaders of San Jose called for a work stoppage 
and a united demonstration of miners from the 
other centers. The call was broadcast on the 
union radio until 11 A.M. At 11:20 A.M. 14 
truckloads of miners arrived in Oruro. The 
union leaders were no longer to be found. The 
mayor and government leaders had left their 
posts. At 12:45 P.M., the military guard of 
Oruro yielded to the insurgents. The demon­
stration was called off. On the following day, 
reinforcements arrived from Santa Cruz by air. 
Radio Pio XU, the Oblate mission station in 
Siglo XX, called for a withdrawal of miners 
still in the area to prevent bloodshed. At mid­
night the radio broadcast a speech, said to be 
by Victor Paz Estenssoro (whose MNR party, 
along with the Social Phalanx of Bolivia l FSB ], 
was behind the rebellion), calling for their dis­
persal. (Those familiar with his voice say that 
it was difficult to recognize it because of the 
poor transcription.) Some of the miners left the 
city in response to his plea. 
The miners were still under contradictory 
orders from their leaders on the following day. 

232 JUNE NASH 
Over 1500 miners from Siglo XX and 
Huanuni, resolved to take the Oruro airport 
and hold it against the insurgents, were 
repelled by heavily armed forces, and 8 were 
killed. According to 2 miners taken prisoner, 
their leaders had told them that they would be 
joined by military forces under the command 
of President Torres (Presencia, August 23, 
1971 ). The prisoners reported that the direc­
tors of the union escaped in some of the vehi­
cles, leaving the dead and wounded without 
help (Patria, September 22, 1971 ). 
The 280-day presidency of Juan Jose Torres 
ended after 3 days of fighting in the capital 
cities of Santa Cruz, Oruro, Cochabamba, 
and La Paz departments. Torres had given 
the country over nine months of freedom -
freedom for workers to reorganize the unions, 
for students to march in protest against impe­
rialism, and for politicians of the right as well 
as of the left to formulate positions and seek 
alliances. For some, this freedom meant only 
anarchy, but in a country that had lived in a 
state of dependency and subjugation to outside 
economic and political interests, it was a time 
to assess who Bolivians were as a people and 
where they were going. 
Throughout his term, there had been persis­
tent rumors of intervention by the United 
States. That the US Embassy knew that a coup 
was about to take place is established by 
the warning to stock up on food supplies 48 
hours before the coup in La Paz� reported by 
Cuban correspondent Ernesto Gonzales 
Bermejo. Reports indicate that Torres had 
himself reserved 60 places for exiles in the 
Chilean Embassy. The reported association of 
Major Robert J. Lundin with Banzer prior to 
and during the coup (Washington Post on 
August 29, 1971) has been denied as having 
had a serious impact on the movement of the 
rebels in Santa Cruz by General Remberto 
Iriarte (Presencia, August 31, 1971), but those 
who were in Bolivia during the coup attest to 
the importance of a network of radio commu­
nication linking the activities of rebels and 
demoralized government armed forces. 
Despite the US denial of military involve­
ment, officials did not conceal their satisfac­
tion at the success of the coup (Presencia, 
August 30, 1971 ). The financial support imme­
diately offered the Banzer government indi-cared to Bolivians which side the United States 
was on. On August 28, Presencia reported a 
US loan of $2,500,000 for cotton agriculture. 
On September 7, Presencia announced in large 
headlines US offers of $100,000,000 credit 
with $3,000,000 earmarked for construction 
of three new markets. The Bank of America 
announced a $12,000,000 loan to the Nation­
alized Mining Corporation of Bolivia Septem­
ber 11, 1971. Victor Siracusa, US Ambassador, 
promised special financing to Bolivia that 
would offset any problems with the proposed 
law restricting imports (Presencia, September 
14, 1971). Brazil and Argentina added to US 
promises loans totaling $10,000,000. 
The new government is relying on military 
strength to hold on to what it has gained. The 
university and mines were occupied by troops 
until September. Recently armed tanks were 
delivered to Oruro, where the barracks are sit­
uated right next to the mining encampment. 
The two parties that backed the rebellion, the 
Social Phalanx of Bolivia and the National 
Revolutionary Movement, still maintain an 
uncertain alliance, but the old left-of-center 
supporters of the latter have urged Paz 
Estenssoro to denounce the government of 
Banzer for its treatment of students during the 
raid on the University of San Andres. 
Reading the newspaper reports of the after­
math of the coup, I felt that I was back in 1954 
in Guatemala, when Castillo Armas entered 
the country with 200 rebel troops equipped by 
the United Fruit Company and backed by 
promises of support from the US government. 
I was living in an Indian town in the western 
highlands and saw trucks loading campesinos 
with nothing more than machetes to "defend 
their revolution,, the njght that Jack Purifoy, 
special representative of the US government, 
maneuvered the ouster of President Arbenz. 
The coup also has a parallel in the US invasion 
of the Dominican Republic, when President 
Johnson sent in Marines to take back control 
from a government considered too far left. 
Recalling the consequences of our interven­
tion in these countries, I began to reflect on the 
role we social scientists are called on to play. 
Do anthropologists go to these countries just 
to write epitaphs for the movements that are 
cut down when they go beyond the limits the 
US government sets for them? Those of us who 

ETHNOLOGY IN A REVOLUTIONARY SETTING 233 
are concerned with the welfare of the people 
we study must reveal what we know about the 
US involvement and what it means to them. In 
the months I worked in Oruro, I came to 
realize the CIA symbolized the American pres­
ence in Bolivia. Their agents act in secrecy and 
are protected by the State Department, while 
we, as American citizens, must bear the burden 
of guilt for their actions. It seems a corollary 
of this that we must dedicate ourselves to erad­
icating their influence on our government' s 
policy. 
The role of the participant-observer in a rev­
olutionary setting has a special dynamic. Just 
by being there, threatening the existing role­
structure and hovering in the conflict of iden­
tity, I became an instrument in the research. 
The attacks directed against me gave informa­
tion of the inner conflicts of a people who had 
suffered · "in their very flesh" the presence of 
the United States and the abhorred CIA agents. 
In evaluating my own role in the commun ity, 
I realized that the CIA agent is not entirely dif-
. ferent from the witch in the Maya communit y. 
The difference was that, while I despised the 
activities of the CIA of my own country, I felt 
neutral about witches in another country, and 
while I became one of the targets of accusation 
in Bolivia my cultural distance protected me 
from becoming part of the witch hunt in the 
Maya commun ity. This breakdown of my 
carefully cultivated "cultural relativist" posi­
tion forced me to realize that it was premised 
on a colonialist attitude. I did not judge the 
witchcraft institutions because I felt removed 
from and impervious to them. In Bolivia I was 
no longer able to maintain this pose, because 
the CIA agents and I were part of the same his­
torical continuum. I realized more fully the implications of Maquet's (1964) rejection of 
the scientific attitude of impersonal objectivity 
as inappropriate for the kind of research in 
which we by our very presences are instru­
ments of that research. The world is no longer 
our laborator y, as Berreman has remarked 
(1971:100), but a community in which we are 
coparticipants with our informants. 
Anthropologists are now at the crossroads 
in defining a participation-observer perspective 
more adequate to the load that revolutionary 
stress is putting on their role in the field. We 
must begin to specify the ''degree of indeter­
minancy" (Heisenberg, quoted in Mannheim, 
1936) arising from our own perspective. We 
can no longer retreat into the deceptive pose 
of neutralit y (Henry, 1966). Science advances 
only by honest declaration of the convictions 
that influence our data gathering and analysis. 
It is a paradox that the physical sciences cast 
aside the pose of neutrality decades before the 
social sciences, with their presumably greater 
humanitarian orientation. In Bolivia I became 
convinced that part of our professional task as 
anthropologists is to attack the multifarious 
ways in which the US State Department oper­
ates to destroy the independence movements 
of the countries that supply it with raw mate­
rials. Levi-Strauss ( 1969:52) announced pre­
maturely that "our science arrived at maturity 
the day that Western man began to see that he 
would never understand himself as long as 
there was a single race or people on the surface 
of the earth that he treated as an object.'' We 
have yet to reach the goal he envisioned of 
becoming "an enterprise reviewing and aton­
ing for the Renaissance, in order to spread 
humanism to all humanity".
