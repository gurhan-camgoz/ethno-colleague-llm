1x1. From Ethnographic Present to Third-Person’s Perspective

Fabian’s deconstruction of time in anthropological discourse attempts to reveal how anthropological knowledge is in contradiction with ethnographic ﬁeldwork in terms of its use of temporality. Whereas in the ﬁeldwork, the anthropologist and its cultural other are in a coeval and dialogical relationship that operates in an intersubjective temporality which is shared as the locus of anthropological knowledge; the anthropologist denies this coevalness to its other, that is the object of the study, by rendering this other as non-subjects by using pronouns and verbs in third person which “mark an Other outside the dialogue” (Fabian 2014, 85). Fabian traces a tendency in ethnographic description as the use of present tense, which he calls as the ethnographic present, which is “the practice of giving accounts of other cultures and societies in the present tense" (Fabian 2014, 82). As the anthropologist assumes this ﬁrst person point of view, the writing addresses the second person which is perhaps other anthropologists or scientiﬁc community, while the third person as cultural other is muted or cannot speak. This is simply not coincidental or accidental as in marking a literary genre of ethnography, but “a choice of expression which is determined by an epistemological position" which reveals a cognitive stance that “presupposes the givenness of the object of anthropology as something to be observed" (Fabian 2014, 86). 

"Method is expected to yield objective knowledge by ﬁltering out experiential ‘noise’ thought to impinge on the quality of information. But what makes a (reported) sight more objective than a (reported) sound, smell, or taste? Our bias for one and against the other is a matter of cultural choice rather than universal validity" (Fabian 2014, 108).
The critical question with Fabian is indeed how to account for this experiential noise, and his solution points to a dialectical resolution that synthesizes the relationship between the autobiographic past and the ethnographic present as reﬂexion, which renders anthropology as a hermeneutic activity that interprets the experience of the ethnographer positioned in the ﬁeld. In a sense, ﬁeld is the coeval space and anthropology must recognize this coevalness which ethnography presupposes but the anthropologist denies by reﬂectively hiding the subjectivity. In order to rescue this coevalness and the intersubjective time, a ﬁrst step is “to recuperate the idea of totality” (Fabian 2014, 156). Then, Fabian turns towards Marx to rescue a sense of proportion after perhaps sounding too Hegelian and claims that the allochronic discourse of anthropology remains an idealist position and that includes all materialisms; whereas he oﬀers to think of a sensuous nature which ties consciousness “as an activity to the production of meaningful sound" insofar as this “involves the labor of transforming, shaping matter" (Fabian 2014, 161). Consciousness is the realization of the production of meaningful sound, a fully speaking and hearing Self that overcomes the contradiction of cultural diﬀerence; it is a kind of uniﬁcation of anthropology and ethnography such that awareness is predicated upon hearing meaningful sounds that are produced by self and other.

For Fabian, then, perhaps time is indeed an echo given the commutativity of intersubjective time “for the temporality of speaking implies cotemporality of producer and product, speaker and listener, Self and Other“ (Fabian 2014, 164). The resonance between the speaker and the listener is pure meaning as it cancels any noise, or it cancels into noise; for Fabian is either too quick or too late to assume that the act of speaking produces a being listened-to or even a heard, let alone any understanding. If the Wagnerian ethnographic device had an echo-locating human bat inside, Fabian’s has an eternal clock that swings between the temporal rhythm of the knower and the known which is its ‘self-relation’, self-resonance or self-standing. Fabian brings the fetishization of ethnography up to its transcendental limit, forms an analogy between speaking of the other without backing up and the inﬂationary printing of money, and then wonders where has its meaning gone: “What, to stay with the metaphor of inﬂation, would be the gold that gives the conceptual paper money circulating in discourses about the other its value?“ (Fabian 2014, 181). The auto-referential abstraction or the full automation of anthropological knowledge coupled with the coeval force of the ethnographic here and now, from which it extracts its meaning and which it dissolves, perhaps as money does away with commodity to beget more money: M-C-M’ or Anthropology-Ethnography-Anthropology’ to M-M’ or A-A’.
  
We are pursuing here the structural homology, as explained by Kolozova, between philosophy, capitalism, and patriarchy as tautological value exchange systems that erect value as self-standing through the destruction of materiality (Kolozova 2020); extending this homology into the anthropology’s seizure of materiality which succumbs human to a communicative rationality in a society, tied to the demands of ‘produce now’ or ‘consume now’, which is the same side of the same coin, ‘communicate now’, that cannot ﬂip to its other side. For the issue lies not on the side of anthropology, nor the ethnographic device as they are not opposed, but their functioning as a signifying automaton that abstracts value or meaning as self-standing. It is as if we not only render noise meaningful, but also make that meaning stand on its own; which is of course a hallucination, if not entirely visualist in Fabian’s sense but also an auditory hallucination. Without conceiving a dialectical relationship or any synthesis that grants a coherence, Kolozova considers the relation between the signifying automaton (language) and physicality (matter) as unilateral, which makes the conception a radical dyad: “a dyad is radical insofar as its components are not determined by the relation of one of the elements to the other but rather by the real, inside the dyad and the real of the dyad itself as determining materiality“ (Kolozova 2020, 5). ‘Noise’ is the real of the dyad, it is indiﬀerent to meaning but it unilaterally determines meaning according to the materiality of the real. Noise is radically foreclosed to thought, it is the impenetrable kernel of non-sense which makes it impossible to be ‘overcome’, whereas we can proceed with aﬃrming its foreclosure. 

Kolozova ﬁnds in Marx but also in Laruelle an aﬃnity to think from a ‘third person’s perspective’, to make oneself an object for a third person as well as to postulate the determination of thought by materiality as the real, which doesn’t grant the overcoming of this duality but of diminishing this tendency of philosophy as philosophy is too quick to announce to have overcome the contradiction it takes as a given: “The science of the species being of humanity postulates all reality, including the subjective, as object of investigation and, therefore, the thought as objective. This type of objectivity is placed beyond the subject-object dialectics“ (Kolozova 2020, 26). This eliminates the need for any dialectics between the autobiographic past and the ethnographic present as it does away with the opposition of doing and saying through a superposition; such that thinking can trace or submit to the “syntax of the real“ and give a descriptive account of its structure as a “minimal transcendental“ or minimum use of philosophy which is called the operation of ‘cloning’ (Kolozova 2020, 39; Laruelle 2021, 87). This cloning operation does not condition thought into a cancellation or an annihilation into noise; our clones are echoes as material conceptions that submit to noise without attempting to account for its meaning or becoming one with its essence; they are under-determined as material instances by the real. 

One can evince a double-slit experiment analogue in ﬁeldwork, in which the anthropologist conducts an experiment with the ethnographic device as a recorder: whenever any observation, measurement, or valuation is eﬀectuated, there appears a ‘collapse’ in the wave function which reveals the observation eﬀect. This ethnographic device can only ask ‘which way’, or can’t record the position and the momentum, or the location and the intention at the same time; to which the anthropologist reacts by attributing to oneself this observation eﬀect, as in giving time or echoing time to oneself. Thus, an anthropologist like Ingold can talk about ‘participant-observation’ as an ontological commitment in terms of “a fulﬁllment, in both letter and deed, of what we owe to the world for our development and formation“ (Ingold 2014, 388). Ingold’s commitment here echoes that of a property owner’s, who has come to ask for what’s essentially theirs in seeking their fair share of rent from the tenants who are perhaps the other participants that cannot make observations, or whose observations are transitive, melting into anthropological value. Their participation, and their observations are rewarded by the anthropologist who reasserts the value of anthropology as a gratitude for their taking part in the anthropologist’s little thought experiment.
