3x1. Swinging from a Hilltop in Athens

<In another ‘touristic’ exploration in Greece, we were wandering around the limestone hills of Streﬁ in the neighborhood of Exarcheia and it was where we have met ‘Don Juan’. For all intents and purposes, I will keep calling this man Don Juan out of personal reasons and to occlude his identity as well as forming a likeness with the infamous Don Juan in Carlos Castaneda’s books. Our Don Juan was somewhat diﬀerent than Castaneda’s but in a lot of other senses, I could not help myself but think about those books that tell the story of Don Juan during this interaction (Castaneda 2016; Castaneda 2018). When we ﬁrst saw him on top of a rock on this hill, he seemed to have found his ‘place’ and perhaps he was already expecting us to ﬁnd him. He was sitting there in the face of the sun, so sure of his place under the bright sky and above the city of Athens overlooking the Acropolis. He was an Alevi-Kurdish sage, an expert in medicinal herbs, as well as a miner, and he had many patients and animals that he was caring for. Out of many stories he has told in many places he has been, I will focus on and re-express his story of coming to Greece.  

Living in the Bağcılar neighborhood of Istanbul in the 1990’s, which is a workers’ district, he was hand printing a weekly journal which involved a lot of satire and controversy about the daily aﬀairs. In one of the issues of this weekly journal, he had written a poem claiming ’There is no God’ and ‘Religion is a Lie’, which apparently got him into a lot of trouble. He was sued with nonsense charges, nonsense because such a statement is ‘normally’ protected under the freedom of expression principle in the secular judiciary system of Turkey. At this moment, he goes back to his childhood and recalls a time he was working in the mines somewhere in central Anatolia. He had spent considerable time in jail because they were protesting the sale of these mines to foreign companies, and he recalls the times he was tortured in jail. ‘I could not go back to jail’ and the tipping point happened in 1999, with the Marmara Earthquake. Right after the earthquake, he went to work in the rescue operations since he knew how to work within debris, within the wreck as he is a miner. He says he had not even needed too many equipments, as miners know how to work with minimal equipment and perfectly with their hands. He had pulled out countless, dead and alive bodies out of the ruins. After these rescue operations, he came to a realization: The situation in the country was a mess, and his trial was not going anywhere as he sensed that he was going into jail once more. So, he had taken the last resort and escaped the country on a boat. He hasn’t been back to Turkey ever since. “…Look at this soil, look at these trees: why do you think I am here in Greece? It is the closest I can be on Earth to my own soil, as a human being is rooted in one’s soil. One knows how to work one’s soil, with one’s bare hands. One knows how to grow and take care of these trees, because one is one with the soil, with the trees. Anyone who is forcing you to ‘say grace’ (şükür etmek) is exploiting you using religion and God. Do not ever believe them! Find your places under this sky, and don’t let anyone trick you into believing non-sense…” After a couple of hours on this hilltop, which felt like an eternity in one’s lifetime, we were taught the secrets of inclined walking on these hills, and went down to the city with him. He talked about how these neighborhoods have changed ever since the ‘crisis’, as it was never the same as before. He had stood us to a treat and bought us food, which we enjoyed together. It was getting late and we walked towards the city center saying thank you for the shared time and the food. He said that we can probably ﬁnd him on these streets if you ever end up again in Exarcheia. Right before we left, he had shown us the mural of ‘Berkin Elvan’, the 15 year old boy who was killed by the police during the Gezi Park protests. We waved back at him, at Berkin and all those who have lost their lives or exiled because of political violence in Turkey…> 

Following up from the last chapter where we have tried to demonstrate that the assumed diﬀerence between an anthropologist and a tourist could be cast at another attempt at securitization of the place of the anthropologist, the excerpt above takes the discussion to one step further and forms a parallel with Castaneda’s Don Juan. Of course this likeness does not exist out there in the personhood of our “interlocutor“, nor in the account of Don Juan given in Castaneda’s books; it solely exists within the text, functioning as a limit to our account. Instead of Don Juan, the “interlocutor“ could have been called ‘Mansur’ after the 9th century Suﬁ mystic Al-Hallaj, whose utterance “I am the Real(truth)” has been a controversy in Islamic thought for centuries and who is reportedly preached building the model of Kaaba at one’s dwelling for personal worshipping. Perhaps if the statement could be 3secularized or profanized, we could see our Mansur to have been advising us to build ourselves an observatory at home rather than ﬁnding solace in the transcendences of modern science and its claim for any authority over us. In Suﬁsm, or simply tasavvuf, fana or fena, is the annihilation of ‘self’ or the human ‘ego’, the ultimate station a mystic can pass in one’s total dissolution of the subjectivity in one. 

<Just as we were leaving Athens to go to Istanbul, there was a question tingling in our ears: it wasn’t what we have ‘gained’ from this voyage in Athens but what has been left behind. Any voyage would change its saturation with meaning if one were to not ask ‘what have I gained from this trip’ but ask ‘what is it that we are leaving behind’, and who is this ‘us’ that is moving on in the departure from what has been left behind. Perhaps this is the gist of the diﬀerence between an anthropologist and a tourist that Seremetakis was pointing at: the anthropologist should never ask what have I gained from this interaction as a consumer of landscapes and services that appears as if they are there for the extraction of value by selling it to the tourists. The anthropologist always leaves behind, annihilates its own subjectivity, its own researcher identity where the diﬀerence becomes imperceptible. And when it becomes impossible to be diﬀerentiated from the tourists is our reporting in ‘disagreement’ with Seremetakis. Who’s to say what diﬀerentiates an anthropologist that appropriates the meaning for oneself from a tourist; or conversely what diﬀerentiates an anthropologist rid of this suﬃciency from a tourist that does not appropriate but leaves behinds, does not extract value but dissolves meaning in things left behind, materials and memories which are one and the same thing in the last instance… But more speciﬁcally, we could ask what has been really left behind in Athens? One possible answer is an old jacket that had some ‘euros’ and that magical little ‘residence permit’ the European Union gives us and asks us one more time to identify who we are. The realization that you have lost your ‘identity’ is a traumatic one; after bureaucratic phone calls with the Belgian consulate in Athens and in Istanbul, the best way forward has been decided as moving to Istanbul to apply for a visa to be able to go back to Belgium after the loss of the residence permit. You lose your identity and you are not ‘secure’ anymore to go back to where you are legally residing… Going through the visa application process for the second time is still as dehumanizing as it was for the ﬁrst time… While it could ‘secure’ your place in Belgium a second time, it also ‘secures’ your position as an outsider, a temporary one in that, for a second time in the same gesture…>
