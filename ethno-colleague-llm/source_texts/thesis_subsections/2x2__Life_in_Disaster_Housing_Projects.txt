2x2. Life in Disaster Housing Projects

<MEER is the name given to the disaster housing projects that were planned to be built after the 1999 Marmara Earthquake which means Marmara Earthquake Emergency Recovery Project. My family has moved to these disaster housing projects as soon as our keys were handed to us. I had spent a great deal of my childhood in these projects, and I have a couple of childhood friends that I have come to known solely from this neighborhood. My mother still lives in these disaster housing projects and I had met one of my friends from childhood when I was visiting my mother. After initial catching up in terms of how our lives have evolved, we have got to talking about life in the disaster housing projects. I used A to refer to his parts and used G to refer to my parts. 

Here’s an excerpt from our dialogue: A:… Look at this place, they have built this place right after the earthquake claiming that the soil is much safer and rocky compared to the city center whose soil is muddy and prone to earthquake damage. The scientists, they know too much; showing us the safer ways to live our lives. They have brought thousands of people here, built these apartment blocks in which people from all kinds of backgrounds live together.  G: So do you feel like everyone is more or less equal here? A:They distributed these houses according to lottery, but only the people who owned a house before the earthquake could enter the lottery, so even though there was a sense of connectedness after the earthquake as everyone was in one way or another earthquake victims, it has evolved diﬀerently. The renters before the earthquake were not entitled to come here. Although it’s message were put as giving justice to people, injustice was here even from the beginning.G: Do you feel like there is social cohesion, do you feel connected to the projects, to your neighbors? A: Yes, in terms of sharing the space together. But there are frequent clashes in the neighborhood. People did not leave their customs and habits before coming here, they have also brought them. Some of them use the common areas to plant fruits and vegetables, others object saying this isn’t a ﬁeld. Some of them want to build thermal insulation, others say its too costly and there is no need for it. So you get this patchy neighborhood where everyone wants to live according their habits. In this sense, it doesn’t feel very cohesive.  G: What about social functions, do people have places they can socialize, come across each other that is apart from their living spaces? I have seen some cafes and parks that were built after I was gone. A: You see, the plan was to bring all the oﬃcial functions related to local government here: The governorship, the judiciary and other bureaucracy related buildings. They have done that and then put a cafe over here, a park over there. But the ownership of these social places are distributed according to relationships with the ruling classes in the city. Some people embrace these places like it is their own, others object and do not even go near these places. I hear a lot of people complain about the lack of things to do, they detest that there is not a single shopping mall like the ones in the city center. Everyone needs to go to the city center to buy new clothes, to go to cinema and so on. Especially in the evenings, this place feels like a ghost town. It imposes a certain lifestyle on people. G: What do you see as the reason behind this? A: Well I think the plan was initially to direct all the new investments and rebuilding processes towards this newly designed part of the town. But the demolished areas in the city center must have seemed like they were more lucrative to redevelop. They were in proximity to habitual social life that was before the earthquake. The rich people acquired the destroyed areas cheaper than they could. And other rich people have taken a hold of this place, the ones that were close with the new government after the earthquake. Just like the government in the country has been in the same hands since the last 20 something years, our neighborhood representative (muhtar) is the same person since the last 20 years. Once you get a grip of power, you don’t tend to let go of it easily. They have even changed the name of this place to July 15 [he’s referring to the prevented coup attempt in Turkey on the July 15, 2016]. It reveals how they want to ingratiate the big men that rule the city and the country…>

The Marmara Earthquake Emergency Reconstruction Project or simply the Disaster Housing Projects were employed in the areas aﬀected by the earthquake in 1999. It was funded by the World Bank which worked together with various governmental and non-governmental agencies to bring these housing projects for people aﬀected by the earthquake. There were three stages to these reconstruction plans which made the disaster victims pass through tent cities to prefabricated structures which was planned to be temporary, and then from there to permanent housing projects. Tuncay Bilecen asks whether being an earthquake victim was enough to be considered as a beneﬁciary in these new housing projects and argues that the answer to such a question reveals the liberal character of the Turkish state; because the beneﬁciaries in these new projects were determined on the basis of their property ownership before the earthquake. But the World Bank funded reconstruction projects were not the only projects that were built and one interesting project that is noted in Bilecen’s account is called the Arızlı Housing Project, that was built with the 10 million US Dollars donated by the then Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. These houses were distributed through a points-based system that graded the victims in terms of losing their closed ones and their becoming permanently disabled. Bilecen remarks that these people, even though they were paying their tax, were gradually forced out of these buildings by the law enforcement oﬃcers as these houses were redistributed to government oﬃcials and bureaucrats (Bilecen 2021). 

<…As our conversation was going on with the childhood friend, he says that he was going to meet another of our common friends from the streets of the disaster housing projects. He said it would be nice to get back together after all these years, the three of us, and that I should stick for a bit more to see him, to which I agreed. As he also joined our conversation after some time, we greeted each other and I had to explain what was anthropology to him and what was I doing in Belgium.  I use B to refer to his parts in addition to A and G above. B:…It was obvious that you were going to become this scientist G: I am not a scientist, at least not yet B: Yeah but you were going to the private school with perfect grades, we were teasing you as being a private college baby A: You were the one doing it, I wasn’t a part of it B: [Laughs] I was sort of a bully back then A: Yeah, you were bullying me as well B: Anyway, what are you doing back here in these slums ? G: My mother still lives here, you know A: He’s doing research on earthquakes B: Oh right, Camili is the perfect place for researching earthquakes A: Yeah right?  G: I guess… it’s one of the starting points for me, living in these projects B: You want material for your research? I have recently watched this video on the internet… G: What’s it about? B: It’s the truth about why the 1999 happened here the way it did A: Why did it happen then? B: There’s a weapon called the HAARP, its an American invention 2A: Yeah right, as if ‘everything is a game played upon us by the US’ B: It really is, I can send you the video… It says the US has this weapon which can induce artiﬁcial earthquakes from far away… A: It sounds non-sense G: I don’t know, maybe it has some sense, maybe not; but I would approach it with skepticism B: It’s the truth I am telling you…It gives a history of artiﬁcial earthquakes in history…  A: It is an outright conspiracy B: You don’t want to see the bigger picture, look at these houses we are living in: they were built by the ‘World Bank’ A: And? B: America controls the ‘World Bank’, and the murderer always comes back to the scene of the crime….  High-frequency Active Auroral Research ProgramG: So are you saying they have both caused the earthquake and then built the disaster houses? B: Yeah… To appear as if they are helping us, or saving us so that we can stay indebted to them…>
