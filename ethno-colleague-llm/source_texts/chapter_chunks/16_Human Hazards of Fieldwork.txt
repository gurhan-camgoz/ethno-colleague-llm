Human Hazards of Fieldwork 
Nancy Howell 
If we were thinking of the hazards of humans 
as disease and accident vectors, many of the 
hazards experienced in the field could be put 
in this section. Venereal disease, for instance, 
is a "contact disease" of humans, but we will · 
classify it as an infectious disease and confine 
our attention here to the hazards of human 
hostility and conflict. 
More than other hazards, interpersonal 
assault and threat are touchy subjects for 
anthropologists, calling into question the rela­
tionship that the fieldworker is supposed to 
establish with colleagues and with the subjects 
of his or her study, as a matter of professional 
competence. Nevertheless, these failures do 
happen, and whether the anthropologist is in 
some sense to blame or is blameless, many 
anthropologists suffer interpersonal attacks 
during the course of their fieldwork. 
Some anthropologists, when reporting these 
kinds of problems during fieldwork, are quick 
to poinr out that the same kinds of problems 
of criminal attack might occur in the home 
society -and, indeed, some are sure that the 
field is much safer than home in these respects, 
even if there is still some danger. 
We start by looking at the frequency of the 
kinds of events that we consider "criminal": 
theft, fighting, assault, rape, and murder. 
Table 1 gives the overall table of numbers reporting one or more interpersonal problems, 
to self and to other members of the research 
.group. Note that the percentages given are 
cumulative, so that the percent under "others" 
includes those that reported the hazard for 
self. And the categories are nested, so that if 
an event occurred to oneself and to others in 
the group it is coded as happening to self. 
Political problems, stemming from govern­
mental or political movements such as arrest 
and military threat are not included in 
Table 1 and will be considered later in this 
chapter. 
We note that the majority of those who 
work in Africa report one or more kind of 
interpersonal hazard, and that those who 
work in North America have the best record 
of avoiding these problems. 
We also note that most of those who report 
any such problem report it as having occurred 
to themselves rather than to others of the 
group. Generally speaking, common events 
show this pattern of being reported primarily 
for self, while rare events are more often 
reported for others than for self. Criminal 
hazards seem to be highly variable by area. 
Where they are common, they are reported pri­
marily for self, and in other areas they are not 
reported for either self or others in the group. 
A similar pattern would be expected if some

respondents reported while others denied 
interpersonal hazards. 
About one third of those who work in Latin 
America, Africa, and the Pacific report having 
been robbed during fieldwork (Table 2). In 
South Asia, the rate is about one quarter. In 
North America, despite the American reputa­
tion for lawlessness and incivility, only about 
13% report having been robbed in the field. 
Overall, about one in four report one or more 
robberies during fieldwork, and some have 
been robbed many times. Countries with par­
ticularly bad reputations for robbery are 
Kenya, Peru, Colombia, and New Guinea. 
Maintaining the distinction between criminal 
and political acts is often difficult in these parts 
of the world. Many of the robberies reported 
occurred in national capitals or other big cities 
on the way to fieldwork but were not directly 
a part of the fieldwork experience. 
During traveling to and from the field, one 
is at risk of robbery because one is burdened 
with carrying luggage while being disoriented, 
tired, and unsettled. Pickpockets may lift a 
wallet, and luggage, cameras, and backpacks 
are frequently stolen in transit, in airports, 
while getting a taxi, checking in to a hotel, and 
so on. Shoulder bags are especially common 
targets in some parts of the world, where the 
experience of having one's bag grabbed by 
someone on a passing motorbike is frequently L. America India Africa Pacific Total

reported. The difficulty of replacing a stolen 
passport or travelers' checks is both common 
and disheartening. 
Hotel rooms are another frequent site of 
theft for travelers, by hotel emp loyees or by 
outside thieves who might be ex-employees, 
ex-residents in the hotel, or just ordinary 
thieves. Some travelers bring along a wedge­
shaped doorstop for use in hotel rooms, which 
will not eliminate the danger of theft but at 
least will prevent break-ins while one is in the 
room. Some people leave passports, tickets, 
and travelers' checks in the hotel safe while 
visiting a dangerous area. (Good advice on 
managing the risks of theft is given in Hart 
1985.) 
Circumstances of robbery are likely to vary 
by areas of the world. In some places, anyone 
walking around who does not look like a local 
is at high risk, whereas in other areas it is the 
knowledge of the tempting money and goods 
that might be taken that seems to pose the 
greatest risk. 
A matter of great concern under such cir­
cumstances is the keeping of guns. Some 
researchers want to have a gun in order to 
prevent or retaliate against robbery, but the 
knowledge that there is a gun in camp may 
enormously increase the probabil ity of being 
robbed, as a gun is a very valued possession in 
many areas. Knowledge that one keeps a gun 

236 NANCY HOWELL 
may also lead robbers to come armed with 
guns, increasing the danger to everyone. 
One may also be robbed by informants 
or employees. Many anthropologists have 
reported that they have lost valuable posses­
sions in the field, but few are willing to 
describe the incidents "on the record." It is 
easier to talk about thugs in the capital or 
bandits who sweep down into the village, but 
hard to talk about breakdowns of reciprocity 
at the field site, especially for social-cultural 
anthropologists. For all robberies combined, 
20% of archaeologists report robbery, while 
27% of social-cultural anthropologists report 
the same thing. 
Many examples can be cited. Napoleon 
Chagnon (1974) tells of a number of instances 
where temporary employees or village bullies 
stole trade goods, food, or research equipment 
from him, some of which were later recovered. 
When Louis and Mary Leakey were newly 
married, they were working at Hyrax Hill in 
Kenya. Local bandits broke in and stole every­
thing from their tents. In response they got 
a dog, and have kept dogs with them in the 
field ever after (Leakey 1984:71 ). Dian Fossey 
was robbed of a case containing her money, 
checkbook, passport, and car papers (Cole 
1975:345). 
In Nairobi, Kristen Hawkes and Jim O'Con­
nell (University of Utah) had their entire truck­
load of supplies for an expedition to the Hadza 
stolen. Not only camping geai; but notes, 
cameras, and research supplies were taken, 
leaving only a case of bully beef. This delayed 
the research considerably and almost threat­
ened to end it, since the materials were essen­
rial and they could not easily replace them. 
Again in Nairobi, Hawkes and O'Connell 
were robbed by four men on foot, while they 
were walking from the hotel to dinner. Her 
jewelry and money were taken, and his watch, 
wallet, and pocket knife. A passerby in a car 
saw the robbery going on and stopped and 
rescued them, but the robbers were not caught. 
This crime was reported to the local police and 
embassy. 
Mark Owens (Owens and Owens 
1984:107), who worked with his wife in the 
Kalahari, reports: 
Later, when we unloaded in camp, we found 
that our three months' supply of flour and sugar had been stolen from the truck, along 
with some other grocery items. We were 
furious. On our limited budget, there was no 
going to Maun until our next regularly sched­
uled trip, so for three months we were without 
bread, an important part of our diet. Since 
most of the door and window locks on the old 
Land Rover were broken, there seemed to be 
no defense against being robbed, other than 
for one of us to watch our goods every minute 
while in the village. 
Owens also reports ( 1984:1 07) that he pro­
tected his goods in the truck after that disas­
trous theft by killing a couple of large and 
feared mamba snakes and draping their bodies 
over the fresh supplies in the back of the Land 
Rover. He says that even after the locals real­
ized that the snakes were dead, no one touched 
the goods, probably because the bizarre sight 
of them suggested witchcraft to locals. 
Physical Violence 
The three categories -assault, fighting, and 
beating -are similar in that they all refer to 
interpersonal struggles in which physical 
injuries were inflicted, but they seem to differ 
in the locus of the responsibility being 
assigned. Note that fighting and bearing are 
more frequently reported for others in the 
research group, while assault is much more 
commonly reported for self. In may be that 
"assault" is a word we use to describe cir­
cumstances where the victim is held to be inno­
cent of blame, whereas "fighting" implies 
more aggression, and being beaten implies 
defeat. In interviews, it has emerged that the 
"others" referred to in these responses are 
typically male graduate students and junior 
colleagues. 
There are many known instances of assault 
to anthropologists, and they are found in all 
parts of the world. In Papua New Guinea, 
Robert Welsch, then a student at the Univer­
sity of Washington and now at the Field 
Museum in Chicago, was assaulted and 
stabbed in a robbery attempt while staying in 
a university residence for researchers in Port 
Moresby. There had been an outbreak of rob­
beries around the university in 1980. Welsch 
was sleeping in his room one hot night, when 
seven of these "rascals" broke into the housin g

unit. Three entered his room, armed respec­
tively with a baseball bat, an ax, and a long 
kitchen knife. Welsch resisted and was stabbed 
between the ribs in the struggle. They fled 
without taking anything of his, although 
others in the residence were robbed that night. 
He was taken to the hospital by colleagues, 
underwent surgery, and recuperated in the hos­
pital 12 days, and then in the home of Mac 
Marshall. Welsch partially blames himself for 
the attack, for sleeping with his door open on 
a hot night. Afterward, the university installed 
a simple whistle in each room as a low-tech 
alternative to burglary alarms. 
Lorraine Sexton reports that one time she 
was driving with Mac Marshall and his wife 
and child near her field site in Papua New 
Guinea when they were approached by ax­
wielding "highwaymen' attempting to rob 
them. Marshall adds to her account that when 
he realized the threat "I sped up and aimed 
right for the guy with the ax. When he finally 
realized that I would hit him, he flung the ax 
to one side and ran, looking very scared." 
Charlotte Ikels, Case Western Reserve, 
writes that when she was interviewing in Hong 
Kong she was robbed at knifepoint in the stair­
well of a building. 
Napoleon Chagnon (1974:4) tells of many 
instances among the Yanomamo of threats 
of violence and occasional hits or planned 
attacks, especially when the locals had been L. America India Africa Pacific Total

taking hallucinogenic drugs. On one occasion, 
Chagnon tells of one of the village men, under 
the influence of drugs, coming toward him 
with an arrow ajmed directly at his chest. 
Chagnon believed that the purpose of the 
behavior was to make the anthropologist tum 
and run, exposing his rear as a target, and he 
decided that he would stare the aggressor 
down, despite the dangers of provocation. As 
it happened, this dangerous gamble was 
rewarded with success. 
A recent encounter with violence occurred 
in Philadelphia, in April 1988, when an 
employee attacked four archaeologists with a 
knife. According to the New York Times of 
April 12, 1988, Glynn W. Sheehan, the direc­
tor of a salvage archaeology project on the 
Schuylkill River., and his wife, Anne Jensen, 
were attacked when they attempted to come to 
the rescue of two women being raped by the 
employee, Arthur Faulkner, who was arrested 
in New York City the next day. Sheehan and 
Jensen were stabbed, seriously injured, and 
were apparently left for dead. Sheehan crawled 
for help to the nearest house and got an ambu­
lance and the police. 
Rape and Attempted Rape 
Before Sheehan and Jensen arrived, the 
employee, Faulkner, had cornered Clarice J.

Dorner, of Elk Grove, Illinois, in the barn that 
was used for the headquarters of the archaeo­
logical excavation on the banks of the 
Schuylkill River outside Philadelphia. He was 
in the process of raping her when another 
archaeologist, Annaliese H. Killoran, of Lynn, 
Massachusetts, arrived and tried to stop the 
attack. According to the account in the Times, 
be raped and killed both women. 
Rapes occur among many occupational 
groups, and in many parts of the world. The· 
special risk factors in this case seem to have 
been the relatively isolated location of the site 
and the need for manual labor rather than any 
features of the archaeology itself. Generally 
speaking, rape seems to be a special danger to 
women who are unknown to the local power 
structure, which protects most women most of 
the time. Women anthropologists may be 
outside protective networks, even if only tem­
porarily, and may be unaware of the signals of 
challenge and deference with which local 
women protect themselves. 
Rape, including attempted rape, is a difficult 
topic to study, since many women do not want 
to discuss the topic. Table 4 shows that rape 
was reported by 2% of all fieldworkers, 7°/o of 
the women in the study. Some of them are 
motivated hy the fear that women who have 
been raped lose status and respect and are seen 
as pawns in the male game of aggression and 
competition. Other women are more con­
cerned about issues of employment and 
research opportunities that could be denied to 
them on the excuse (or perhaps the true 
motive) of wanting to protect women from the 
risk of rape in the fieJd. All in all, it is a touchy 
subject, and one that I am quite sure is under­
reported in this sample. 
In all, four anthropologists in the sample 
reported that they personally had been raped L. America India Africa Pacific Total

in the field, but two of these are women report­
ing an attack on themselves and two are 
men reporting an attack on their wives. 
Eight researchers, in addition, reported that 
someone in their study group other than self 
or spouse was raped (or experienced an 
attempted rape) during fieldwork in which the 
respondent had participated. Overall, about 
6% reported a problem with rape in their 
fieldwork. 
While the data are uncertain, it seems to be 
the case that the threat of rape is highly local­
ized: in some areas, at some periods of time, 
there is little or no risk, while in other areas it 
is hard to avoid. North Africa, localized parts 
of East Africa, New Guinea, and parts of Latin 
America (Peru stands out in the accounts) have 
been cited as particularly dangerous, while 
Europe seems to be relatively safe. Nader (in 
Golde 1986:111) states that threats to women 
in the Middle East have been highly exagger­
ated, and cites customs of protection of certain 
categories of women ("sisters of men") that 
should make foreign women safe. Other infor­
mants, however, disagreed that fieldwork was 
safe for women workjng alone in Muslim 
areas. Generally speaking, knowing the area 
and knowing people in the area seem to be 
factors in safety, whereas being alone, tired, 
and disoriented seem to be factors in danger. 
Murder, Suicide, and Other 
Mysterious Deaths 
Murder attempts against themselves were 
reported by five anthropologists in the sample 
(two Latin Americanists, two Asianists, and 
one North Americanist), and another four 
reported a murder attempt against a member 
of the research group (two in Latin America, 

HUMAN HAZARDS OF FIELDWORK 239 
rwo in Europe). One researcher reported a 
suicide attempt by a member of the research 
group in India. Another in the sample was 
arrested and tried for the murder of a member 
of his research group. 
A famous old case of an anthr opologist 
killed by the people he went to study is that of 
the death of William jones, who was. at the 
Field Museum in Chicago until he was killed 
by the Ilongot of Northern Luzon in the Philip­
pines around 1908. There have been other 
cases -in Latin America, New Guinea, and 
Africa -and there have been cases where 
anthropologists simply disappear and no one 
ever knew what happened to them. 
Another well-known murder case in the 
history of anthropology is the death of Henri­
etta Schmerler , a graduate student at Colum­
bia who died during fieldwork at the Fort 
Apache 1 Reservation in Arizona in 1931. 
Schmerler , a student of Ruth Benedict, was 
described by Morris Opler, who was a 
member of the research group, in the follow­
mg way: 
According to Goodwin, Miss Schmerler, who 
greatly admired Margaret Mead, was deter­
mined to duplicate her South Seas work in the 
Apache context and especially to gather mate­
rial about Apache sex life. This is a subject 
about which Apache elders do not speak 
easily to virtual strangers, and they refused to 
cooperate. The youth who slew her inter­
preted her emphasis on sex in her research as 
a sign of looseness and invited her to ride 
behind him on his horse, something that 
young people of opposite sex among the 
Apache do not do unless they are courting. 
Miss Schmerler , unaware of this, accepted . 
When he made advances and was rebuffed, 
the young man was angered at what he per­
ceived as enticement and then rejection; the 
struggle, assault and death followed. (Opler 
1987:3) 
The Schmerler case is almost a litmus test of 
whether anthropolo gists assume that they have 
to take the blame for everything that goes 
wrong in the fieid, or whether others are seen 
as independent agents who might be held 
responsible. The possibility that women might 
not be permitted to do fieldwork because of 
their susceptibility to rape and murder came 
close to the surface in this situation. Franz Boas wrote to Ruth Benedict when he heard 
the news: 
I cannot tell you how shocked and also 
worried I am by the fate of Henrietta. I am 
trying to imagine what may have happened 
and cannot conceive of anything that should 
have induced nowadays an Indian to murder 
a visitor. [In another letter after receiving a 
detailed report on the events:] It is dreadful. 
How shall we now dare to send a young girl 
out after this? And still. Is it not necessary and 
right? (Mead 1959:408-10) 
It is still true that women hesitate to speak 
out about rape or threats of sexual assault for 
fear that their freedom of action will be 
restricted. 
No doubt the most famous case in recent 
years of an anthropologist killed in the course 
of her work is the death of Dian Fossey, 
hacked to death with a panga knife in her 
research hut in Rwanda, during the night of 
December 27, 1985. Fossey had been working 
with the mountain gorillas of that area for 
some 15 years, and had been in frequent con­
flict with local residents and local officials who 
resented her high-handed ways. No one knows 
who broke into her cabin and killed her, as was 
shown in the recent film of Fossey's life ( Goril­
las in the Mist), but Mowat's book (1987) 
entertains several hypotheses. Local authori­
ties charged one of the graduate students and 
one of her long-time local employees. These 
two people were convicted of the murder, in 
absentia, and the case is considered closed by 
the Rwandan government, although primatol­
ogists familiar with the case are convinced that 
neither was guilty. 
Not all murder attempts are successful. 
Napoleon Chagnon (1974: 178-80) tells of 
being in a hostile village among the 
Yanomamo with a severe allergic reaction. 
Throughout the night, as he tossed and turned 
in itching and discomf ort, he shone his flash­
light around the village to orient hjmself when­
ever he woke up. Later he learned that the 
village leader and his two brothers, carrying 
axes, had crept up close to his hammock 
intending to crush his skull while he slept, but 
just then he had shined the light on them, and 
they had stopped in fear of his knowledge and 
his powerful gun. Hearing this story, Chagnon 

240 NANCY HOWELL 
decided to avoid work with this group for the 
foreseeable future. 
In some cases of mysterious death in the 
field, how the death occurred is not known, 
and perhaps never will be known. 
A German anthropologist, Harold Herzog, 
from the Max Planck Institute near Munich, 
was found shot with his own gun in the jungle 
of Venezuela where he was doing fieldwork 
with the Yanomamo. Despite the reputation of 
the Yan.omamo as the "fierce people" there is 
reason to believe that his death was due to acci­
dent or suicide rather than murder, although 
his entry to his daily diary gave no hint of 
despair that day. The Yanomamo reported the 
death to local authorities and said that they had 
just found the body near the gun (Polly Weiss­
nee, personal communication, 1986). 
In the early 1980s, Melanie Fuller, a gradu­
ate student in the biology department at the 
University of Chicago, and a student of Stuart 
Altmann, was in East Africa attempting to get 
started on dissertation research when she ran 
into difficulties. She broke off her agreement 
with her supervisor and spoke of establishing 
another topic with another supervis or. Then 
she was not heard of for some weeks. Her 
parents got in touch with local authorities in 
Kenya and investigators found her body in the 
bush, and identified it by dental records. The 
cause of her death is unknown; her money and 
documents had not been taken. 
Political Hazards 
It is often difficult to distinguish during field­
work between the kinds of threats that stem 
from criminal impulses on the part of others, 
and those that arise from political motives and 
circumstances. What feels like irrational rejec­
tion by a segment of the village may follow

and the arrival of hostile army officers with 
questions and demands to inspect papers may 
arise from racial hatred, a desire for bribes, the 
presence of the organized guerilla movement 
aiming to overthrow the government, or the 
suspicion that the researcher has broken a law 
of the land. 
We tend to assume that our colleagues are 
innocent of offenses, but we can probably all 
think of instances where a colleague broke 
local laws. 
Don Johanson tells (Johanson and Edey 
1981:15 8-9) of needing a human knee joint 
for comparison with a fossil when they found 
important new Australopithicine bones in 
Ethiopia. In the excitement of an important 
find, he compelled a reluctant graduate student 
to help him take a bone from a modern Afar 
burial mound, although he had been warned 
that any approach to the modern burials 
would be considered an outrage to local feel­
ings. Some researchers feel that consequen ces 
of that act have had negative implications for 
all foreign research in Ethiopia. 
Whether or not the individual was guilty of 
law breaking, about 5% of our sample of field­
workers report having been arrested in the 
field, and about 9% experienced an arrest in 
their group (Table 5). Some of the charges 
were minor, but one was the arrest of the 
group leader on murder charges, and two were 
arrests on drug smuggling charges in South 
America. 
Military Attack 
Like arrest, involvement with the military in 
other countries can be a frightening event. The 
hazard was described as "military attack," but 
apparently respondents included harassment

and questioning by the military, not just armed 
attack. Table 6 shows the experiences reported 
with the military. 
In areas of guerilla warfare, anthropolo gists 
may be suspected by the military of helping 
or supplying the rebels. The rebels may see 
anthropologists as allies of the government or 
as competitors for resources or people. In Peru, 
guerillas have been known to retaliate against 
villagers who sold food to an expedition. We 
recall that 31% of our informants reported 
having been unable to work somewhere when 
they wished to because of political instability. 
Another difficuJty that anthropol ogists 
sometimes have in the field is being suspected 
of spying. Bruce Schroeder of the University of 
Toronto tells of being arrested by the Syrian 
Border Patrol while surveying in the Anti­
Lebanon Mountains for sites in Lebanon in 
1972, apparently due to suspicion of his 
motives for working so close to the border. His 
group was taken across the border to several 
civil and military authorities in small villages 
until they reached Damascus. They were 
·released at the Lebanese border within a day, 
but they then faced the difficult task of 
explaining to the Lebanese border authorities 
why they had no Lebanese exit or Syrian entry 
stamps in their passports. Schroeder concedes 
that they probably did look like spies, 
"wearing khaki, and encumbered with maps,

authorities did not harass or mistreat them. 
But they spent a day "riding around Syria with 
armed troops, machine guns and bazookas at 
our backs." They eventually decided that it 
was not possible to work at that site until the 
political situation was resolved. 
An indicator of the degree of trust and good 
will of the local population is probably found 
in the frequency with which investigators are 
accused of spying, a charge that is difficult to 
defend against when one is there in search of 
information, and the uses to which it will be 
put cannot easily be explained to the locals. 
Overall, 15% of fieldworkers report that 
someone in the research group was suspected 
of spying (though only a few of these were 
arrested) (Table 7). 
We note that suspicion of spying is most fre­
quent among those who work primarily in the 
Pacific and Asia (30%). The rare for those who 
work in Africa is moderate ( 17% ), and is 
about 12% for those who work in Europe, 
Latin America, and India. Among those who 
work in North America, the suspicion of 
spying is not frequent, although it has been 
known (Wolff 1964:240). It is striking that 
suspicion of spying is much more frequently 
reported by social-cultural anthropologists 
(about 25%) than among archaeolo gists and

physical anthropolo gists (about 10%). And 
sometimes the suspicion is correct: after the 
crisis, Louis Leakey openly admitted that he 
had been working for the Kenyan government, 
as Mary Leakey put i4 "broadcasting propa­
ganda to the loyalists. and gathering intelli­
gence about Mau Mau groups and their 
leaders., (Leakey 1984:111 ). His fluency in 
Kikuyu and his knowledge of the people and 
the history of aU participants in the conflict 
made him invaluable to the government. His 
love of Kenya made him willing to do what­
ever he couJd to preserve a state with room for 
Europeans as well as Africans. 
Another kind of hazard even more fre­
quently reported by fieldworkers is living 
through a period of political turmoil in the 
country where the work is being done. These 
episodes are not necessarily focused on the 
researchers, but it may be stressful and dan­
gerous at times when one's presence and inten­
tions may suddenly come into question. · 
Examples are periods of revolution, war, or 
rioting. Naturally, the rate of such problems 
depends very much upon the countries in 
which one is working. June Nash (1979), for 
example, tells of living through a strike in a 
Bolivian mining commun ity, where she was 
forced to, and chose to, take sides with the 
strikers against the government, at consider­
able personal and professional risk. 
We note that about 30% of those who have 
worked primarily in India and in Africa report 
experiencing political turmoil during their 
fieldwork, as do 24% of those who have 
worked in Latin America (Table 8). North 
America, and Asia and the Pacific were places 
of political turmoil to about 13% of the 
workers, and Europe had the lowest reported 
rates, at only 6%. There is no striking differ­
ence in the rates for social-cultural versus 
archaeological field workers. We notice that the

16% 6% hazard usually occurs to all or none in the 
research group, although there are a few cases 
where .it was said to have happened to others 
in the group but not to self. 
Often the events involve several categories 
of problems at the same time. For instance, 
Ronald Cohen (University of Florida) tells of 
having a vehicle accident in Nigeria, during the 
period of Ibo massacres in northern Nigeria in 
1966. People were being killed, and he was in 
the process of getting his family into the 
country. Just then, he had the bad luck to hit 
a cow with his truck. What might have been a 
minor mishap in peaceful times was extremely 
stressfuJ during a period of national crisis. 
Cohen's African advisers helped him to resolve 
the problems quickly with the owner of the 
animal, ands he and his family were able to go 
to the peace of their field site destination. 
Factional Conflict 
A milder form of the same phenomenon is the 
experience of living through acute conflict 
within the unit being studied, for example, a 
struggle between factions in the village or 
organization under study, which might include 
violence. Overall, about 11% report having 
had this kind of experience as a part of field­
work (Table 9). 
Hostage-Taking 
A rare but severe form of interpersonal threat, 
almost always politically motivated (although 
the desire for ransom may be a motivation), is 
taking hostages. Five of the 204 respondents 
(2%) were involved in hostage-taking inci­
dents in the field -two in Latin America, and 
one each in the Indian subcontinent, Africa, 
and Asia and the Pacific (Table 1 0).

Perhaps the most famous incident of this 
kind was the abduction of three Stanford Uni­
versity students and a Dutch citizen by para­
military kidnappers from the Congo. They 
were taken in 197 5 from the Gombe Stream 
Reserve, where chimpanz ees were being 
studied in the field by Jane Goodall and her 
associates. A ransom was paid by Stanford 
University before the students were released. 
One of those students, Barbara Boardman 
Smuts, went on to get a PhD in neuro-and 
biobehavioral sciences and became a profes­
sional anthropologist. 
More recently, a woman archaeologist and 
her four-year-old child were kidnapped by 
guerillas in Peru and later abandoned in the 
desert. They managed to get back to safety. 
Assassination 
Mowat speculates whether the death of Dian 
Fossey should be attributed to poachers or 
whether it was a product of a faction in the 
resentful power structure of Rwanda. The case 
reminds us that anthropologists may be killed 
in the field for motives that are political rather 
than personal.

who was a professor at Maputo University in 
Mozambique, where she was killed in her 
office in 1982 by a mail bomb. It is suspected 
that the bomb was sent by the South African 
secret service to end her effective political 
protests against apartheid. First died on the 
job, even if she was not at the moment doing 
research "out in the field., Bridgit O'Laugh­
lin, who works in the same research institute 
in Maputo, was injured in the same explosion. 
Despite the difficulty of distinguishing polit­
ical from criminal or merely interpersonal 
causes of dangers from other people, the 
hazards of political problems can readily be 
seen to be real and frequent. Overall, 42% of 
those who worked in the Indian subcontinent 
reported experiencing one or another of these 
kinds of problems, as did 37% of those who 
worked in Latin America, 35% of those 
who worked in Africa, and 26% of those who 
worked in Asia or the Pacific. Rates for those 
who worked in North America (22%) and 
especially in Europe ( 12%) were notably 
lower. 
We have seen that interpersonal problems 
make a substantial contribution to the diffi­
culties of fieldwork. They are not the major 
cause of death -our next topic, accidents, is 
that. And very likely the rates of interpersonal 
violence and difficulty are no higher for field-

244 NANCY HOWELL 
workers than they are for other members of 
the society under study, and maybe not any 
higher than in one's own society at home. 
Human nature includes variation every­
where, and a person who has no difficulty at 
home may have a difficult time in the field 
setting. Conversely, a person with a reputation 
for difficult interpersonal relations at home 
sometimes does well in the field. And the best 
balanced and most socially skilled person may 
not find it possible to live and work in some 
circumstances without interpersonal conflict. 
A field site that is easy to work at one time may be very difficult a decade later. It is part 
of the nature of anthropology that anthropo­
logists tend to take credit for fieldwork that 
goes smoothly, and to feel guilty or unpr ofes­
sional when serious difficulties arise, especially 
in human relations. While these feelings are 
understandable, it is likely that many of the 
elements in the interpersonal equation are not 
under the control of the anthropologist . 
. . . It is important that these problems 
should not be denied, especially to young 
people starting to think about becoming 
anthropologists.
