Self-Conscious Anthropology 
Anthony P. Cohen 
... an anthropology that makes an ethnographic problem of itself offers pragmatic insight 
into the social worlds it examines and to which it belongs. (Herzfeld 1987: x) 
Some Biographical 
Observations 
Many anthropologists with fieldwork experi­
ence will recall the uncertainty with which they 
actually, or mentally, answered the question 
put to them by people whom they were 'in the 
field' to study: 'Who are you?'. The uncer­
tainty is composed of a number of factors: 
What should I say? {i.e. what would it be 
politic to say?) What can I say? (i.e. what could 
I say that would be intelligible? Is there an 
answer which is at once comprehensive and 
faithful? Do I even know who I am?). We cope 
with this aggravated sense of self-conscious­
ness by resorting to all sorts of more or less 
honourable devices. But the problem should 
be seen as one of self-instruction as well as of 
strategy. It ought also (but seldom does) put us 
on our guard when we reciprocate with the 
same question. So anxious are we for infor­
mation that we often fail to see just how per­
plexing the question can be. Evans-Pritchard 
famously recalled his Nuerosis in regarding the 
unforthcoming Nuer as bloody-minded, 
rather than as stumped (1940: 12-13). I was 
impressed by the disinclination of Whalsay 
islanders to offer introductions when we first 
met. I supposed that, since they all know each other and knew of my existence it did not 
occur to them that I would not know who they 
were. After all, on their own territory how 
could anyone not know? When I would 
enquire of a friend about the identity of a third 
party to whom I had just spoken, the answer 
would usually be given in terms of genealogi­
cal referents. Genealogy is rarely a neutral 
account in Whalsay, if anywhere, but is 
perhaps the most neutral, least complicated 
answer available. In public discourse in 
Whalsay, who a person is depends upon who 
is being asked and by whom. 
In the summer of 1986 I took with me to 
Whalsay the first draft of the book I was then 
writing about the community, intending to 
show it to some of the people who appeared 
in the book (Cohen 1987). One man who 
looms large in it is a controversial figure, well 
known for the single-mindedness and vigour 
with which he pursues his campaigns. His 
presence locally is such that he might reason­
ably be described as 'universally known'. 
Notwithstanding the regard and affection I 
have for him, I had tried to write about him 
'warts and all', reporting his somewhat 
ambivalent standing in the estimations of the 
islanders. I made reference to various anec-
. dotes which are invariably offered locally as

evidence of his idiosyncratic behaviou r. He did 
not object to any of this -although his own 
explanations of these anecdotal incidents were 
notably more prosaic than the versions which 
circuJated throughout Whalsay -nor of my 
account of the extremely contentious manner 
in which he had campaigned thiny years pre­
viously for a harbour development, an argu­
ment which caused considerable strife within 
the community and which still evokes painful 
memories. He made only one objection: to my 
description of his brief fishing career as 'inglo­
rious', the judgement of it which was certainly 
made by the many people who had commented 
about it to me. Far from being inglorious, he 
said, it had been 'da maist glorious' time of his 
life. 
All the stories elicited by mention of his 
name are of things 'known' about Henry: 
'everybody knew' them, 'Oh, aye, we aa' ken 
wir Hendry'. Yet, what was known 'about' 
him was clearly not known by him, or was 
known in a quite different way. Indeed, he 
would not recognise himself in other people's 
versions of him. Self-knowledge and social 
knowledge of persons are incongruent. 
Anthropologists tend to privilege the second 
over the first, in spite of their personal experi­
ence of the fallacies with which the Other con­
structs the Self. 
Many years ago, at a conference in Scotland, 
I presented a paper which contrasted strategic 
modes of public identity among political 
activists in rural Newfoundland. I contrasted 
them as, respectively, over-and under-commu­
nicating the bayman archetype of the New­
foundland outporter: as, on the one hand, 
emphasising, and on the other as masking the 
stigmas popularly regarded as inhering in 
Newfoundlander identity within Canada 
(Cohen 1975).1 A member of the audience who 
had known me slightly ten years earlier during 
my undergraduate days told me later that the 
paper was only incidentally about Newfound­
landers: it was obviously an autobiographical 
statement. I was sufficiently shaken by his 
observation not to want to pursue the discus­
sion, but assumed that he was referring to my 
jewishness, lapsed entirely in religious obser­
vance, supposedly betrayed in my committed 
anti-Zionism, but nevertheless evident in my 
name. I did not think then that he was correct (nor do I now): I was wntmg about New­
foundJanders, rather than about myself. 
However , his comment did persuade me that, 
as an anthropologist, my concern with identity 
had its source in my personal experience; more 
than that, that my construction of identity as 
'a problem' or dilemma, though hardly origi­
nal, was a reflection of my own struggles. It 
would not be contentious to suggest that many 
anthropologists are motivated by a personal 
problematic as well as by mere intellectual 
curiosity (an issue raised in several contribu­
tions to the 1989 ASA Conference, Anthro­
pology and Autobiography). Fabian tersely 
remarks that, 'our past is present in us as a 
project' (1983: 93}. 
There is nothing very novel in this. If we 
accept that anthropology is an essentially 
interpretive exercise, it must be clear that inter­
pretation cannot begin from a tabula rasa. 
Rather, it must use all the resources of sense­
making that are available to us. Further, it 
would be impractica l, tedious and a denigra­
tion of our expertise to have to provide an 
autobiography as the interpretive key to our 
ethnographies. If we are really saying that the 
only paths to the Yanomamo or to the 
Whalsay islanders are through the life-histories 
and self-analyses of their ethnographers, we 
clearly call into question the scholarly integrity 
of the entire ethnographic record. Knowing 
that Leach was a mathematically-insp ired 
engineer (Leach 1961: 6, 1984: 9-10} may 
enable me to appreciate some nuance in Polit­
ical Systems of Highland Bunna (1954) which 
I had previously missed; but I do not need to 
know his background in order either to read 
his account of the Kachin, nor to make a 
judgement about its authentic ity. By the same 
token, Nuer Religion (Evans-Pritchard 1956) 
and The Dnuns of Affliction (Turner 1968) 
must both be comprehensible as accounts of, 
respectively, Nuer and Ndembu, rather than 
as records of their authors' conversion to 
Catholicism. But that is not to say that they 
can or should be regarded as ethnographic and 
interpretive documents which somehow stand 
independently of their authors' religious expe­
riences and convictions. 
So, what importance should we impute to 
the anthropologist's self? Where should it fit 
into the equation, if at all? It is a commonplace 

110 ANTHONY P. COHEN 
of fieldwork experience that we learn a good 
deal about ourselves while struggling to under­
stand others. This self-discovery does not 
concern only our hitherto unsuspected 
resourcefulness, durability and ingenuity; it is 
also that, by struggling to understand other 
people's complexities, we are brought face-to­
face with our own. Thus, Jean Briggs's 'dis­
covery' of the emotional discipline displayed 
by Utku Inuit prompts her also into frustration 
with her own emotional self-indulgence 
(1970). Southwold' s doubts about God and 
Buddha are re-energised by the confrontations 
of 'theological' and 'village' Buddhism in Sri 
Lanka {1983). There is here a transposition of 
self and other. Indeed, in anthropological dis­
course we are accustomed to making instru­
mental use of the Other in our self-discovery. 
But we have been educated to the contrary 
view: that using the self to discover the other 
offends the fundamental canons of anthropo-: 
logical science. How curious that we should 
have succumbed to this rigid discrimination. 
Needham argues that it arises from anthro­
pologists' assumptions about psychological 
universality: that we suppose we can recognise 
others' states of mind because we assume they 
must be like our own, or can be linguistically 
constituted as such (1981: 57, 60). He goes on 
to castigate such assumptions. However, I 
would suggest that our dogmatic segregation 
of Self and Other has had the contrary conse­
quence of constituting us (self) as qualitatively 
different from the Other, depicting this quali­
tative difference in terms of our complexity 
and uniqu eness, and their simplicity and gen­
eralisabil ity. As Wendy James puts it, we 
impute to ourselves a 'potent ego', but to them 
a lack of 'moral personhood' (1988: 143; 
1987: 57). This is the discrimination which 
Hannerz satirises as the 'Great Divide' (1983: 
350). We do not avoid egocentricity, ethno­
centricity (nor Eurocentricity for that matter 
(Needham op. cit.: 71; Herzfeld 1987: 7) by 
supposing we can, or should, neutralise the self 
until the completion of the day's research 
work. To the contrary. The inevitable con­
junction of self and other has been noted by 
Stein as one of the processes of 'counter­
transfere nce' characteristic of medical diagno­
sis (Stein 1985} where self insinuates itself as 
an 'explanatory model' (Kleinman 1980). As an anthropologist, I cannot escape myself; nor 
should I try. In studying others I do not regard 
myself as merely studying my self; but rather, 
as using my self to study others. 
Another Biographical 
Observation 
Recently, three of us, schoolfriends since the 
ages of nine or ten, were talking about the 
efforts of our ex-headmaster to contact former 
pupils of the school (which no longer exists) 
all over the world. It had been a very small, 
predominantly Jewish school which, after the 
Second World War, had mostly recruited 
foreign pupils, particularly from the Middle 
East. My two friends, both lawyers, were 
reflecting on the disproportionat e number of 
our former associates who seemed to have 
achieved professional or financial success, or 
have risen to positions of prominence in their 
own countries. They surmised that our Jew­
ishness, that is, our membership of an histori­
cally disadvant aged minority group, motivated 
us to impress ourselves on our host societies, 
and suggested that this applied to each of us.2 
Again, I disagreed. First, it did not explain the 
absence of such motivation among many -
most?-Jews, nor among other minority ethnic 
groups. Second, it did not address my aware­
ness of my own motivation since, in most 
circumstances, I am not conscious of myself as 
a Jew. 
I said as much-as, indeed, I have for as long 
as I can remember, but my friends demurred, 
figuratively tapping the sides of their noses: 
'we know better'. Do they? I read my own 
conduct and life in one set of terms; they con­
struct them in another. Are they not doing to 
me, like the Whalsay islanders do to Henry, 
what we do as anthropolo gists {a) to those 
whom we study, when we subordinate their 
individuali ty as members of society X or as 
bearers of culture Y (d. Needham op. cit.: 56); 
and (b) when we insist on reading our col­
leagues' works biographically as well as, or 
instead of, ethnographically (Geertz 1988)? 
Incidentally , our disagreement about me is an 
interesting refutation of Fortes's contention 
that self-knowledge is only knowledge if it is 
extemalised: 

SELF-CONSCIOUS ANTHROPOLOGY 111 
How does one know one is a Jew ... ? One 
can only know it, obviously, by showing it in 
some way; to sit back in your armchair and 
know gets you nowhere; it is meaningless. So 
if you want to know who you are, you have 
got to show it ... (1983: 395-6) 
In the past we blithely referred to our self· 
consciousness as fieldworkers. But we have 
barely begun to plumb the depths of that con­
sciousness, nor of its implications, for anthro� 
pological research and writing. For years we 
were instructed to eliminate it from our 
processed anthropol ogy. We now acknowl edge 
that self-consciousness is a useful learning 
device through which we test on ourselves our 
perceptions of the cultures we study. More­
over, many of us would accept that, by its very 
nature, ethnography is an ethnograp her­
focused· art. 'The magician', says Hastrup, 'is 
part of the plot' (1989), a sentiment echoed in 
many of the papers at the 1989 conference. But 
how do we avoid writing just about the magi­
cian, or so positioning her/him that the trick is 
obscured? 
A further complication is our ingrained and 
correct fear of ethnocentrism which inhibits 
us from recognising qualitative similarities 
between the self of the anthropologist and that 
of the anthropo logist's 'subject'. This would be 
defensible if it was due only to a determina­
tion to avoid constructing others in one's own 
image. But it is not defensible if it results in the 
axiomatic denial of such similarity when this 
has the consequence of denying to others the 
complexity which we impute to ourselves . By 
and large, we do not regard ourselves as gen­
eralisable. Yet, the categorical techniques of 
our discipline, indeed the conventional defini­
tion of our task as the discovery of 'culture', 
implies our generalisation of others. We have 
reserved the Self as the province of mysticism, 
of artistic expression or psycholo gy. Anthro­
pologists' concerns with it have been deni­
grated as self-indulgence (Friedman 1987) or 
worse (Sangren 1988), or have been confined 
to the elaboration of putative cultural theories. 
Perhaps this is because we do not know how 
to reconcile the notion of the unique self with 
a generalisation such as culture. We (anthro­
pologists) have 'method'; they {those whom 
we purport to observe) have culture. We have strings to our bows besides anthropolo gy; that 
is, beyond our method there lie our selves 
(which we may confide to our diaries, even to 
novels or to poetry). What could lie beyond 
their culture, assuming we exclude biology? It 
has been a peculiarly inhumane approach to 
ethnography {cf. Okely 1975) and one for 
whose exposure the 'reflexivists' and experi­
mental ethnographers can claim some credit. 
Let us determine to avoid trying to reinvent 
the wheel. The purpose of this discussion is 
not to rehearse the weary old truism that the 
ethnographer's self intrudes upon the ethnog­
raphy; nor that social theory should address 
the relationship of the individual and society -
for it, and anthropolo gy, have always done so. 
Indeed, anthropology has long acknowledged 
its difficulty with the self. Our present object 
is to so formulate the problem that we might 
begin to exploit the intrusive self as an ethno­
graphic resource rather than suffer it as a 
methodological hindrance. I suggest three 
ways in which this expedient use of the self 
may help us. We can use our experience of the 
complexity of our selves to contain the anth­
ropologist's temptation to generalise and 
simplify others. We may recognise that self­
hood, the sense of personal identity, is not 
merely contingent or relative, but has a certain 
absoluteness, or a 'self-driven' element. 
Finally, with these points in mind, we might 
make sense of concepts in other cultures which 
approximate to our notion of 'personhood', 
but without rendering them egocentrica lly, 
ethnocentrica lly or Eurocentrical ly, as ana­
logues of our concept of self. 
An Historical Sketch of the 
Anthropology of the Self 
I suggest that we will nor be much assisted in 
this exercise by recent musings of experimen­
tal psychologists, nor of some philosophers 
(while Luhmann is elegantly sceptical about the 
help available from sociology (1986: 313-14)). 
The philosophers seem strangely absorbed by 
the problem of whether a person at different 
moments may be properly spoken of as the 
'same' person (Williams 1973; Swinburne 
1984 ), and with distinguishing among the 
body, the person and the self. Psychologists 

112 ANTHONY P. COHEN 
pursue their own semantic puzzles over dis­
criminations between person or self, and 'per­
sonality' (not to be confused with Mauss's 
struggle with personne, personage, and moi); 
and clearly tend towards relativism: to a view 
of the self as 'other-directed' (Gergen 1977). In 
this, they resemble early psychological anthro­
pologists like Hallowell, Lee and Florence 
Kluckhohn. Lee added a Buberesque ideologi­
cal dimension to her view of the socialness of 
the self, arguing that its autonomy can only be 
realised in a person's 'relatedness' with others, 
the degree to which such relatedness is 
achieved being an expression of 'cultural value' 
(e.g. Lee 1976). Hsu pursued the point, with 
some sophistication, distinguishing among 
gross cultural types - Chinese, Japanese and 
western - on the basis of the extent to which 
the individua l's 'psychosocial homeostasis' (the 
essential self?) is rooted in relationships of. 
her/his own making, the Chinese being at t?e 
minimal extreme, the western at the maximal 
(e.g. 1985). The spectre at this feast, often curi­
ously unacknowledged by British anthropolo­
gists (with Fortes an honourable exception (e.g. 
1973)), is G.H. Mead. Mead went beyond a 
recognition that individuals cannot be 
regarded as cultural automata, to consider in 
some detail the question of how the individual 
symbolises her/himself in interaction, a 
concern from which the tradition of symbolic 
interactionism sprang. 
Mead distinguished between the 'Me' -the 
unthinking being, the enduring product of 
experience - and the 'I', the consciousness �of 
being, the being which, through its competence 
to symbolise, is capable of behavioural 
control, precisely because it conceptualises the 
self. The 'I', the active agency of being, has to 
be continuously creative to keep the person 
(including the 'Me') viable, a view of the 'self' 
which has had recent anthropological echoes 
(e.g. Heelas 198la: 13-14; Lock 1981: 32). 
Much of Mead's work elaborated this creative 
aspect of the individual, dealing, for example, 
with the human's unique power to 'manipu­
late', to intercede, through 'mind', between 
means and ends; to intervene, say through lan­
guage, in the process between perception and 
'consummation'. It is in this mediating phase 
that individuality inheres in the form of reflec­
tive thinking. Mead's individual, both in its reactive and proactive modes, is permeated by 
the Other; but, to the extent that reflexivity is 
retained and nurtured, is not determined by it 
(see, e.g. Mead 1934). 
Such influence as Mead had on anthropol­
ogy was largely through the interactionists and 
phenomenologists, surfacing later among the­
orists of strategy, game and transaction. It 
seems to have missed most British scholars, at 
least until after the 'discovery of mind' and the 
demise of the deterministic paradigms. That 
Mead is still not routinely taught to British 
undergraduates is an expression of this histor­
ical neglect, but the omission has become even 
more curious with the accession to our reading 
lists of contemporary 'reflexive' anthropology. 
For Mead of course, as, earlier, for Cooley, 
social interaction is at the very foundation of 
self-conception: both are accomplished by 
'taking the role of the other' - viewing oneself 
and one's behaviour from what is imagined 
to be the perspective of an Other, anticipating 
the Other's reaction. The 'I' component of the 
self is the analyst of this self-'observation' who 
modifies or plans behaviour on the basis of 
the analysis. The conceptual material for the 
analysis is partially derived from 'culture' 
(which accounts for the similarities among 
members of a society); but is mediated through 
the individual consciousness in ways which 
reflect cultural theories of the relation of 
individual to society. 
This all sounds rather dated in the context 
of recent symbolic theory and developments in 
linguistics and semiotics. However , another 
curiosity of recent anthropology is that our 
conceptualisation of the self, the symboliser, 
has not kept pace with our ever more complex 
and refined approaches to symbolism itself. In 
his book on ethnic identity, Epstein ( 1978) 
quotes the Leach of a decade earlier sounding 
even more relativistic than Mead himself: '1 
identify myself with a collective we which is 
then contrasted with some other. What we are, 
or what other is will depend upon context' 
(Epstein 1978: 100, quoting Leach 1967: 34). 
By contrast, Epstein also quotes Rabbi Mendel 
of Kotsk - and one could be forgiven for won­
dering who, of Leach and the Sage, is the ·modern and who the medieval: 'If I am I, 
simply because I am I, and thou art thou 
simply because thou art thou, then I am I and 

1 
I SELF-CONSCIOUS ANTHROPOLOGY 113 
thou art thou. But if l am I because thou art 
thou, and thou art thou because I am I, then 
I am not I and thou art not thou' (Epstein 
1978: 1). 
The reluctance to address the issue of the 
essential self may have been the product of a 
tradition of social theory which, since the late 
nineteenth century, had treated self-conscious­
ness as an aberration. For Marx, in capitalist 
society it was a false consciousness, a mani­
festation of the individual's alienation; for 
Durkheim, it signified the inadequate subordi­
nation of the individual by society. Mauss's 
concern with the person or self took the form 
of a cross-cultural review of the degrees of 
licence afforded by cultures (and their legal 
and religious institutions) to individuals and 
individualism. His was still, and not surpris­
ingly, a structural rather than an 'experiential' 
approach to the self (Mauss 1938; Carrithers 
et a/. (eds) 1985). Throughout the traditions 
of structural functionalism and British struc­
turalism, the individual was analytically 
consigned to membership of groups and 
categories, and perceived as refracting their 
collective conditions and characteristics. This 
was entirely consistent with a theoretical 
model in which the parts of society were 
conceptually identified by reference to their 
unique functions. In this kind of schema, indi­
viduals were regarded as significant as struc­
tures in themselves or as related to structure in 
identifiable ways, a view which is still pro­
pounded by Dumont (1986).3 Even in struc­
turalisme, individuality is subordinated to 
the uniformities of cognitive structures. In all 
these approaches, the individual is depicted as 
determined by culture, society, psychology or 
environment, or by a combination of any of 
these. Hence, individuals were regarded as 
generalisable. Individuality was thus portrayed 
as a theoretical problem: as a deviation from 
a putative norm, it was something to be 
explained -as wilful deviance, a failure of 
socialisation, or as the breakdown of the 
normal constraints of life. 
Whatever the particular theoretical variety 
of anthropological positivism, individuals 
were displayed as almost incidental. This 
posture did not change appreciably until we 
began to recognise 'meaning' as a problem; to 
see social differentiation within cultures in every respect as normal; to push the problem 
of generalisation to the centre of the method­
ological stage. 
The relationship between this general para­
digm shift and the conceptualisation of the 
individual is obvious. We belatedly recognised 
'meaning' as a matter of interpretation� rather 
than of stipulation, and then also had to revise 
our view of symbolism accordingly. Not only 
were symbols acknowledged as saying many 
things in many voices, but as being heard in 
quite different registers. Hence, the idea of 
culture integrating its individual members by 
their sharing of its symbols required some qual­
ification. Further, we came to recognise that this 
variability of meaning might not be susceptible 
to ethnographic 'documentation', precisely 
because the very nature of symbolism locates it, 
at least partly, in a non�observable realm. 
Symbols are thus perceived by people through 
their individual {rather than culturally-cloned) 
consciousnesses. We cannot hope to make 
sense of their perception of symbols- that is, of 
their 'membership' of society -without 
acknowledging their individuali ty; and cannot 
do that without recognising the character of our 
own. I see no more of myself in Leach's state­
ment of contingency than I do in my friend's 
version of me as a replicate of their experience 
as Jews, or than Henry does in his friends' 
accounts of him as laughably eccentric and 
seasick. Rabbi Mendel tells me who I am not; 
but neither he, nor anyone else, can tell me who 
I am. 
Who Am I? 
If I am not necessarily the person that others 
see, and if I am not necessarily the person who 
I imagine that others see, and if I am not 
merely the persona whom I present to others 
(for whatever reason), who am I, and how 
might I discover the answer? As I suggested at 
the outset, posing the question is instructive 
because it alerts us to the enormity of the task 
we assume in describing other people - and to 
the immensity of our misrepresentations of 
them when we treat them categorically {'as 
typical examples of a genus, (Watson 1989}); 
or when we confuse them with our and others' 
perceptions of them. I do not suggest that 

114 ANTHONY P. COHEN 
ethnographers should become psychoanalysts, 
searching for the irreducible essence of a 
person buried so deeply that the person may 
be unaware of it: simply, that we should allow 
the intracta bility of the problem to discipline 
our pens. Hywel Lewis described the difficulty 
eloquently, but succinctly, in his Gifford 
lectures: 
(If I a� asked) what is this 'I' that has these 
thoughts and this pain, how is it in turn to 
be described over and above describing the 
thoughts or the pain, or noting them, what is 
the self or subject over and above there being 
the pain etc.?' - I am wholly nonplussed. 
There is nothing I can begin to say in reply, 
not because it is exceptionally difficult to give 
a correct description, but just because there is 
no description that can be offered. My dis­
tinctness, my being me, is quite unmistakable 
to me, there can be nothing like a rare vase or 
painting where we can indicate the properties 
that make it unique, but unique in a final sense · 
of just being itself. (1982: 55) 
This irreducibilit y and elusiveness of our own 
selves should be an invaluable mnemonic. If 
we do not do descriptive justice to individuals, 
it is hard to see how we could do it for soci­
eties. If the substance of 'self' is indescribable, 
and if (as I trust) (pace Douglas 1983: 43) we 
accept that there is no more mileage in trying 
to use the self to discriminate between types of 
society, how, then, can we use the self ethno­
graphica lly? A tentative answer is 'experien­
tially', for this is the only way to avoid the 
fictional abstractions that inevitably emerge 
from sociological theories of individualism or 
of the self, and from taxonomies of society and 
individualism. How is self-hood experienced? 
Ethnography and 
Self-Hood 
Commenting on this chapter at the ASA Con­
ference, my colleague Ladislav Holy remarked 
that, in practical terms, only social knowledge 
is accessible to us; and asked whether people's 
self-knowledge should be an issue for anth­
ropology if it is not available to the eth­
nographer. The ethnographer can only guess 
at it with the experience of her/his own self-knowledge (which, in itself, is relational in 
source and nature, especially when the 'dis­
covery» of the anthropologist's self is so heavily 
influenced by fieldwork and literary encoun­
ters with the Other). In this respect, he 
observed, anthropological accounts are neces­
sarily reflexive and autobiographical. 4 But, he 
concluded, this suggests the danger, all too 
manifest in contemporary anthropo logy, of 
'too much self, too little other'. 
My response to these cogent arguments is 
that, although people's self-knowledge is not 
easily available to the ethnographer, anthro­
pology cannot continue to be written as if it 
does not exist, or is immaterial, or, even, is less 
important than 'social' knowledge. People's 
knowledge of themselves is of critical impor­
tance to us for without it we misunderstand 
them. Its availability does certainly present us 
with profound methodological difficulties, 
for which we may have only the very imper­
fect device of our own experience -and here I 
hasten to distance myself from any suggestion 
that anthropology should be 'about the 
anthropolo gist's self': rather, it must be 
informed by it. 
It is with such self-experience in mind that I 
argue that anthropology may have exhausted 
the usefulness of contingency and relativism as 
means of revealing theoretically how people 
experience self-hood. Relativism has spanned 
diverse theoretical traditions in anthropology 
and is based on views of the individual as 
plastic, as capable of reformulation by society 
through various processes of socialisation and 
initiation. Some exponents of such views 
defend them with the assertion that in the 
societies with which they are concerned there 
is no 'asocial' concept of self and, therefore, 
no experience of self-apart-from-society (e.g. 
Lienhardt 1985). John Mbiti remarks, 'I am 
because we are, and because we are therefore 
I am' (1970: 141). I am not convinced. My 
sense of self does not only become crucial 
when I experience contradictory social 
demands made of me; or social constructions 
made of me from which I dissent. It is to be 
found also in my solitary, Cartesian soliloquy; 
in my experience of personal space; in the 
increasing proficiency with which I learn the 
use of the concept which mediates between 
the absoluteness and the contingency of self: 

SElF-CONSCIOUS ANTHROPOLOGY 115 
'us'. When 'I' becomes 'we', one does not nec­
essarily contradict self but, rather limits it. One 
says, in effect, there are aspects of 'I' which are 
not relevant to 'we' and which must be, or can 
be left out of consideration for the moment. 
The self that is taken into 'we' is a particular­
istic, but not a contrad ictory, version of self. 
I will now attempt to illustrate these various 
points with something of a Cook's tour of the ·
comparative ethnographic record. Several 
critics have called this excursion into question. 
Quite apart from its presupposition of the com­
parability of extremely diverse cultures, and 
the generalisability of any one of them (which 
I have been to some lengths to criticise ), it has 
been suggested that it privileges anthropologi­
cal over indigenous knowledge (Rapport: per­
sonal communication). Further, ethnographic 
examples cannot, of themselves, do anything to 
establish the integrity of my claim for a 'self­
driven self', as opposed to a 'society-driven 
self', which can only be axiomatic (Campbell: 
personal communicati on). 
My critics' reservations would certainly be 
justified except, I think, that my reasons for 
introducing these ethnographic accounts are 
somewhat different. I wish to suggest that a 
person's consciousness of self and of social 
membership are not merely reconcilable, or 
complementary, but that the second may be 
built on the first (rather than vice versa). 
Further, it seems to me that this relationship 
cannot be appreciated without the explicit 
introjection and use of the anthropologist's self 
-and that, far from this being a weakness of 
a particular argument or style of anthropo logy, 
it is both the limitation and the strength of 
anthropol ogy as such. 
'I' and 'We' as Versions of 
the Self 
The first case is drawn from Hastrup' s account 
of the Icelandic freestate, the period between 
settlement by the Norse in the ninth and tenth 
centuries until its full colonisation in the thir­
teenth century. Hastrup suggests that at first 
concepts of time and space were ego-centred. 
People lived in isolation. The measurement of 
time was material only in relation to the 
routine observed in the conduct of one's own subsistence activities. Moreover , since its reck­
oning was based on observations of the sun 
and moon, it would vary according to vantage 
point. Concepts of space were likewise related 
to the unique coordinates of ego's location. 
Space was demarcated by reference to ego con­
ceptualised as occupying its centre.5 As the 
population increased and settlements became 
denser, social relations obviously assumed 
greater prominence and the mechanisms of 
the state proliferated, among them absolute, 
rather than egocentric, standard measures of 
time and space. But the one did not simply dis­
lodge the other. The two systems of reckoning 
coexisted, each prevailing in different spheres. 
So far as the individual' s immediate environ­
ment was concerned (say, the farmstead), there 
was retained a model of space 'as a circular , 
multi-dimensional area with ego in the centre 
.. .' (1985: 56). However, when the space in 
question was beyond the personal 'fixed' 
domain (for example when reference was to 
an area which implied the individual moving 
between fixed points outside his own domain) 
then it was divided by a scheme based on fixed, 
objective coordinates reflecting the socio­
political sub-division of the country into quar­
ters. Rather than being ego-centred, this model 
of space was society-centred (66). For so long 
as the two systems coexisted, the imposition of 
a social system for the reckoning of space did 
not especially compromise the former individ­
ualistic mode. 
A structural-functional reading of this 
history would see the state displacing the self 
to the degree at which the individual became 
a mere basket of social roles or repository of 
social facts, the kind of picture which Wirth 
depicted as the fate of social actors on the 
urban stage (1938). A Meadian perspective 
would sustain the view of the more inclusive 
self evident in Hastrup's account. For example, 
Ralph Turner insists that, 'People are not just 
miniature reproductions of their societies'. 
Rather a person's experience of his/her articu­
lation with social structure generates a 'self­
conception', that is, a consistent symbolisation 
of self which runs through all the person's 
activities (Turner 1976: 989-90). This essen­
tial self may be informed by social engage­
ment, but is not dependent on it: it is an 
expression of autonomy rather than of 

116 ANTHONY P. COHEN 
contingency. Consider this lesson in self-hood 
administered to Turnbull by an Mbuti on the 
banks of the River Lelo. 
The Reality of Self 
Stand at the edge of the water, I was told, and 
look at your reflection. Who is it? It looks like 
you, but its head is down there, looking up at 
the other you. Is it thinking the same thing, 
wondering who you are? Then put out your 
foot, over the water, and gently lower it. The 
other foot will come up to meet yours, and if 
you are very careful (not to break the surface 
of the water), you will feel that other foot 
touch yours. You are getting to know your 
other self. Then as you lower your foot further 
into the water the other foot comes up, passes 
through your foot, and disappears into your 
leg. The deeper you go into the water the more 
of your other self enters into you. Just befo�e 
you go right down into that other world, look 
down, and see yourself down there, all but 
your head. Only your other self's head is 
there. And then look upward as you go right 
under the surface, and you see nothing. Your 
other self has passed into the world you left 
behind, taking your place. Now walk across 
the bottom of the river, and slowly come out 
on the far side. If you look up from under the 
water you will see nobody, just the forest, but 
as you emerge into that world something will 
leave you, passing through your body down 
into the water. Now who is the real self, and 
which is the real world? (Turnbull 1983: 122) 
It is possible to read into this probing of the 
apparent a number of themes which are pro­
minent in Mbuti culture. The one to which I 
would draw attention here is a notion of 
balance. Not only does this seem to embrace 
many features of Mbuti life, but also expresses 
a resolution of the dialectic of self and society. 
The Mbuti live nomadically within the lturi 
forest, speaking a wide variety of languages 
and revealing a plethora of extraneous cultural 
influences. They live in and on the forest, have 
a very fluid kin structure, moving from band 
to band, and from place to place, as they judge 
expedient. Around them, on the edge of the 
forest, live Mbira villagers who contrast with 
them in most respects: they are tribal, seden­
tary, non-pygmy, cultivators, who are incom-petent in the forest, depend on the Mbuti to 
supply them with its produce, but play the 
roles of patron to the Mbuti's client. The 
villagers are alter to the Mbuti ego. 
Here we have the Mbuti, contemplating his 
reflection in the river and talking about his two 
selves. Who or what might they be? They 
could be a metaphorical statement of this 
curious opposition between the forest nomad 
and sedentary villager, but this is improbable: 
ethnic encounters do not often seem to be con­
ceptualised in terms of mirror images -at least, 
not unless we think in terms of distorting 
mirrors. Rather, the very idea of the reflection 
of two images may be a paradigm for the rec­
onciliation of contradictory themes which are 
perceived as inherent in the human social con­
dition, among which is the opposition between 
self and society. So far as the Mbuti are specif­
ically concerned, the existence of oppositions 
and of their resolution is a constant refrain in 
the culture (Turnbull 1965). There is the 
obvious distinction between the Mbuti and 
the villagers: distinct tribally and ethnically; in 
terms of modes of subsistence and social 
organisation; physically and topographically 
different; believing in different gods and 
spirits. Yet, they live in a degree of symbiosis, 
the Mbuti supplying the villagers with forest 
foods (roots, berries, meat and honey) and 
building materials: the villagers, probably 
unwittingly, certainly unwillingly , providing 
the Mbuti with lootable cuh:ivated foodstuffs. 
Their 'contra-definition' is reconciled through 
the great circumcision festival of Nkumbi, held 
approximately every three years, through 
which many of the locally-dwelling peoples 
are federated. 
There are a host of other oppositions: for 
example, between biological and classificatory 
kinship. The latter suggests a pronounced egal­
itarianism, all the women of one's mother's 
generation being one's mother; all the children 
of your child's generation being your children. 
The equality is ruptured by marriage but this 
contradiction is itself at least partially 
resolved, by the licence to resume unrestricted 
sexual relations during the three years follow­
ing the birth of a child. There is the contra-
. diction between the ideals of non-aggres sion, 
of passivit y, of freedom and the sanctity of life; 
and, the necessity for adults to hunt and kill 

r

game and meat, a contradiction resolved by 
the ritual purification of adults, thus polluted, 
by uncontaminated children. There is the con­
trast between the ideal of peace, ekimi, and 
noise or crisis, akami, resolved through the 
mediation of youths bringing the crisis out into 
the open and music-ing it away with the sacred 
molimo-made. 
The metaphor of reflections and reconcilia­
tion might itself be metaphorised as weights on 
either side of a scales. If they are unresolved, 
one pan will outweigh the other. The ideal of 
resolution is to bring them into balance. Being 
out of balance, waziwazi, does not imply 
movement from the individualistic to the col­
lective modes of self. It just means being dis­
oriented. When the Mbuti refers to the 'real 
self', he/she can have in mind both the indi­
vidual and the member of the collectivity. In 
this view, then, the mere fact of sociality does 
not compromise the idea of self. 
Society, Self, Other 
Why might it be that the Mbuti seem to have 
achieved a reconciliation of self and society 
which has eluded most of us? The answer 
might be that they accord greater value to the 
self than to the social: the individual is not per­
manently tied to kin or hunting groups, and 
enjoys a mobility which suggests an avoidance 
of the social impingement of self (and, inci­
dentally, provides a marked contrast to the 
individualism which Riviere describes among 
potentially mobile Guianan peoples ( 19 84: 
94 ff)). But this view bears all the hallmarks of 
that 'society-driven' view of the individual 
which has dominated anthropology and which 
still directs us to limit our interpretation of 
'inner states' to what can be documented in 
terms of 'social facts' (cf. Needham op. cit.) or 
of generalised cultural models of the constitu­
tion of personhood (e.g. White and Kirk­
patrick 1985; Heelas 1981b). If, instead, we 
were to allow the possibility of the self-driven 
individual the Mbuti case would not look so 
discrepant. 
The society-driven view sees the self being 
tugged in different directions by the competing 
claims and allegiances of the individu al's social 
ties, each of which entails a role with appro-priate script. But for too long anthropology 
has simply tended to accept the social psy­
chologists' axiom that we are so subordinated 
-indeed, that we may even connive at such 
self-subordination strategica lly and tactically: 
that is, we attempt to make ourselves appear 
as we believe others would wish them to, or 
in ways in which we would wish others to 
perceive them. In this tradition, the self con­
fronted by society is merely Performance. 
What lies beneath the script and the make-up 
is indiscernible. This kind of analysis threatens 
to elimina te the self as a real entity altogether. 
For example, in his book, The Tactical Uses of 
Passion, Bailey analyses displays of emotion, 
the very antitheses of self-control, in terms of 
their tactical potency (1983). It is a theory of 
self with no null-hypothesis -just as, in his 
earlier exhibition of political masks, he pre­
cludes logically the possibility of a person 
claiming truthfully not to be masked (1977). 
This may be an especially explicit attack on the 
saliency of self-motivation, but it is not much 
more exaggerated than the mainstream social 
anthropology which persists with the use of 
general categories from which the self is 
excluded on the grounds of irrelevancy or 
methodological inaccessibility or is treated as 
culturally defined. 
The contrary, self-driven view may be less 
exciting theoretically, but may be closer to our 
experience. It is cenainly true that we suffer 
from a contemporary idiom which assumes 
our passive conformity and complicity, which 
treats us as reflecting, even parroting the social 
influences which are brought to bear on us. 
•The self', says Lock, 'is constituted by culture' 
(1981: 22). By extension, this would suggest 
that we wear designer -selves by courtesy of the 
advertising copy-writers and market manipu­
lators; indeed, even allow the 'rights' which we 
rhetorica lly express as inalienable from our­
selves, to be defined, and increasingly curtailed 
by the sophistry of our political leaders. 
This view of the self-as-clone should not 
satisfy us. Our own theoretical approaches to 
symboHsm and meaning contradict it. We do 
not merely ingest stimuli, whether these are 
symbols or directives. We interpret them; we 
make sense of them, and the stimulus does not 
dictate what sense we shall make of it. Of 
course those who direct them at us try to 

118 ANTHONY P. COHEN 
contrive in us particular interpretations, or 
attempt to limit the kinds of interpretation we 
might make. But there is evidence to suggest 
that we are still left with plenty of interpretive 
(or misinterpretive) space. The 'self-driv en' 
view does not deny the reality of the pressure 
exerted on individuals to conform to norma­
tive role definitions, nor that many, even most 
people do succumb. There is no suggestion 
here of the individual compulsively fighting a 
war of resistance against society. But experi­
entially most of us would feel ourselves to be 
in control -that is, in control of our selves. 
Indeed, the contrary feeling is defined as 
pathological and may be diagnosed as 'a 
breakdown'. Nor should we dismiss the claim 
to self-control as self-delusion for, in organis­
ing our time and space, our social relation­
ships, our self-definition and presentation, we 
are struggling to keep ourselves in balance, to 
keep ourselves, as the Mbuti would have it, in 
the centres of our spheres. In this struggle, the 
self speaks in the active voice as 'idealist' 
rather than as passiones (see Douglas 1982; 
Heelas 1981b: 39 ff}. Fortes might not have 
wished to go quite as far as my own over­
stated suggestion, but he nevertheless points 
us in the direction: 'The individual is not a 
passive bearer of personhood; he must appro­
priate the qualities and capacities, and the 
norms governing its expression to himself' 
(1973: 287). The public expression or presen­
tation of an identity may be very different from 
its private experience. It is not merely a matter 
of making the implicit explicit (to borrow a 
phrase from Crick (1989)); nor, as Hastrup 
laments, of turning oneself 'inside out' (1989). 
Marilyn Strathern has recently showed that 
this assumption is one of the curses of our time 
(1989). �ublic identity is a transformation of 
the self, not an equivalent expression of it. To 
mistake the two is to make a fundamental 
error about self-percepti on. So far as anthro­
pology is concerned, the active self is present 
again (and again) when the selves of the 
anthropologist ('personal' and 'anthropologi­
cal') contrive an interpretation of what is said 
and heard in the field (Rosaldo 1980: 233; 
Cohen 1987: 94; 1989: 47-9.) 
This does not dispute the existence of cul­
tural theories of the self, nor of indigenous the­
ories both of the constitution of the individual and of personhood. Rather, it complements 
them. For example, take the idea, reported 
both in Morocco and Andalucia, that a 
person's moral credibility (and, therefore, 
social visibility) is based less upon identity 
(who the person is), than upon acknowledged 
moral accomplishment - or, at least, confor­
mity with an ideology of accomplishment. 
Writing about Sefrou, Morocco, Rosen 
observes, 
It is world -and hence a self-in which people 
are known by their situated obligations and 
by the impact their actions have on the entire 
chain of obligations by which they and their 
society are known. Human beings do not 
create themselves but they do place themselves 
in those contexts ... {1984: 179) 
Pitt-Rivers describes reputati on in Alcala de Ia 
Sierra in similar terms (1972). Notwithstand­
ing the putative doctrine of Moroccan Islam, 
Rosen subtly shows that self-hood, like most 
other variable things in Sefrou life, is nego­
tiable and, therefore, is created by the power 
and ingenuity with which the individual 
deploys and exploits available resources. 
There may be tensions between the society's 
dominant ideology of personhood and the 
individual' s concept of self. There are societies 
which apparently attempt to impose complete 
control over the definition and experience of 
self: Goffman's asylum and Campbell's 
/ 
Sarakatsani (1964) (at least with respect to in-
marrying brides) are examples. Goffman 
himself, like other 'total institutions' theorists 
(1964) (but not Campbell), acknowledges the 
difference between imposed role behaviour 
and self-perce ption, a distinction manifested in 
the resilience of self both in 'total institutions' 
and, pace Campbell, in rural Greek marriages 
(Du Boulay 1974). There are societies in which 
these tensions are resolved, but without sanc­
tions; Hastrup's medieval Iceland (above) is a 
case in point. And there are societies which 
theorise the constitution of personhood, but in 
a way which may be tantamount merely to 
providing terms of reference for the self, while 
appearing to do rather more. That is the sense 
with which I read Wendy James's account of 
Uduk personhood (1988). The characteristics 
attributed to stomach and liver constitute 
physiological explanations of personal psy-

SELF-CONSCIOUS ANTHROPOLOGY 119 
chology, but in a quite impersonal way: really, 
they map out explanatory space within which 
the individual can find a unique niche. They 
leave intact the individua l's essential moral 
autonomy and self-motivation. The individual 
is 'singular', possessed of a personal Genius 
(88): 'The human being is the creature of no 
ruling god, no inner passion, nor are persons 
mere puppets of an external order' (91; and cf. 
Beattie 1980: 313-14). Individuals are mostly 
free to contrive their own relationships (94). 
All of this is consistent with the idea of arum 
as the driving force, for arum is 'inside' the 
person (133) and, even having in mind 
Needham's strictures regarding the translation 
of psychological states, might reasonably be 
viewed as an approximation to the concept 
'self'. 
This requires some qualification, for arum 
has multiple meanings: spirit, or ghost (8) or 
spiritual power (11), 'timeless things of myth' 
and pre-civilised people (142); animating per­
sonal force (7) or 'vital being' (100). Arum is 
certainly not simply assimilable to the concept 
· of self, not only because of the multi­
referential nature of the term, but because one 
could not properly speak of a person as being 
in control of arum in the way in which we 
talk about 'self-control'. Arum is force, vital 
essence, and therefore cannot be forced. But 
we do not need to suggest that arum and 'self' 
are equivalents. The beauty of James's exposi­
tion is that, without succumbing to the temp­
tations of translation, she shows how the 
non-equivalent concepts of arum and self nev­
ertheless inform our understanding of each. 
Our own experience of the difficulty of encap­
sulating the concept of self, not to mention the 
confusion which arises from the plethora of 
theories of the self, helps us to an appreciation 
of the elusiveness of arum -and vice-versa. 
This is an intellectual exercise, but one built on personal, subjective experience. That is to 
say, it is a different kind of interpretation than 
might be involved in the juggling of mathe­
matical formulae, or the documentation of 
'social facts'. It is largely the product of intro­
spection, of a scrutiny of the self as a ' ... 
touchstone for understanding the world of 
others ... " Uames 1988: 144). Hence her con­
clusion, and one which I share, that 'Self­
knowledge is intimately linked with the 
possibility of understanding others ... " (156). 
What, then, of the difficulty with which we 
began, of the inaccessibility of 'inner states' or 
self-knowledge? This is not just a problem of 
eliciting 'indigenous psychology', but arises 
whenever we impute a state and product of 
mind to other people (within or across cultural 
boundaries ). It is evoked by questions of 'sym­
bolism', of 'meaning', of 'interpretation', of 
intention and so forth. To declare these out of 
bounds because of the difficulties of concep­
tual or verbal equivalence would be to paral­
yse anthropo logy. It would be the academic 
'equivalent' of retreating from society because 
your closest associates interpret your own 
behaviour and biography in ways which differ 
from yours. There is no option for us as social 
members or as social anthropologists but to 
proceed from the premise of self. It does not 
have to be a flabby procedure. Its vinue lies in 
more than its logical inevitability: it also repli­
cates the process of ordinary interaction, of 
our lay assumptions that we have understood 
each other, that we have achieved 'intersubjec­
tivity'. ' ... [E]very version of an other', says 
Clifford, 'wherever found, is also the con­
struction of a "self'' .. .' ( 1986: 23 ). We have 
long recognised this as a characteristic of social 
life. It has taken us longer to recognise it as a 
necessary condition of anthropo logy. Now we 
should celebrate it as our most potent inter­
pretive resource. 

Part III 
Fieldw ork Relations and 
Rapport 
Jeffrey A. Sluka 
The success of ethnographic fieldwork is in large measure determined by the ability 
to establish good rapport and develop meaningful relations with research partici­
pants. When fieldwork fails, it is generally due to a failure to either establish rapport 
and good relations or maintain them over time. These relations range from friend­
ship to hostility, and may be influenced by ethnicity, religion, class, gender, age, and 
whether the field researcher is alone or accompanied by family. 
One of the main w;tys cultural anthropo logists have established fieldwork rela­
tions is by the development of strong bonds of friendship with particular individu­
als who often become both key informants and research assistants. Making a friend 
has proven to be one of the main ways that anthropologists have been able to estab­
lish rapport during the early part of fieldwork, and Oberg (1974) has suggested that 
it is one of the best ways of countering culture shock. This idea is well established 
in the discipline, and was the central idea expressed in the title of Powderma ker's 
classic study of her fieldwork Stranger and Friend (1966). She believed that "What­
ever the degree of the fieldworker' s participation in the whole society, friendships 
with a few people develop, and they help him to find a niche in the communi ty. It 
is these friends who often become his best informants" {1966:420). 
In the 1990s, reflection on the nature and quality of field relations between 
researchers and informants grew, and the theme of fieldwork and friendship was 
explored in a number of important publications, including Beverley Chinas' La 
Zandun ga: Of Fieldwork and Friendship in Southern Mexico (1992), Nita Kumar's 
Friends, Brothers, and Informants: Fieldwork Memoirs of Banaras (1992}, and 
Bruce Grindal and Frank Salamone' s edited volume Bridges to Humanity: Narra­
tives on Fieldwork and Friendship (1995). In the second half of the 1990s, this inter­
est in fieldwork relations began to extend to consideration of the question of sexual 
relationships in the field. In particular, this was explored in two edited volumes, 
Don Kulick and Margaret Willson' s Taboo: Sex, Identity, and Erotic Subjectivity in 
Anthropological Fieldwork (1995) and Fran Markowitz and Michael Ashkenazi' s 
Sex, Sexuality, and the Anthropologist (1999}. Sex as part of participant observa­
tion is both a methodological and ethical issue. Traditional ly, there was a strong 
taboo against ethnographers engaging in sex with research participants, because it 
was believed that it represented an unfair use of their position of power and an 

122 PART 111: FIELDWORK RELATIONS AND RAPPORT 
inappropriate practice on other grounds. Howev er, intimacy helps break down the 
distinction between "self" and "other" and the cultural boundaries that obscure the 
common humanity of researchers and their informants, and consensual sex between 
adults can be seen not as a power relationship but rather its opposite -the break­
ing down of hierarchy and establishment of equality between them. 
The classic image of successful rapport and good fieldwork relations in cultural 
anthropology is that of the ethnographer who has been "adopted" or named by the 
tribe or people he or she studies (see Kan 2001 ), and less successful fieldwork rela­
tions were rarely discussed until the reflexive trend began to emerge in the 1970s. 
One of the first and best discussions of less than ideal field relations was presented 
by Jean Briggs (1977) in her honest account of her fieldwork in 1963 with an Eskimo 
{Inuit) community in the Canadian Arctic. Briggs was "adopted" by the tribe, but 
failed to maintain rapport with them. In order to achieve acceptance, anthropolo­
gists must assume a role that is defined as believable and non-threatening in the 
eyes of the people they wish to do research with. Briggs found acceptance in the 
form of fictive kinship, by playing the role of a daughter. While this was a classic 
means of achieving rapport and a working relationship with people, this case shows 
that it is not always ideal, and even fictive kinship roles can break down under the 
stress of relations between researchers and the "others" they work with. 
In practice, Briggs found it impossible to reconcile the two roles and "be simul­
taneously a docile and helpful daughter and a conscientious anthropologist" 
(1977:65). She became insubordinate, disobedient, obstinate, and grumpy, 
expressed her anger, did not always help with the chores, and sometimes refused 
requests to share her possessions - pretty much violating most of the fundamental 
values of Inuit culture. Not surprising ly, the tribe found her behavior "comple tely 
incomprehen sible" (1977:65). She grew "annoyed and frustrate d" {1977:67) with 
them, and they with her, and their relationship erupted -into open conflict. She went 
from being treated as a slow child to being treated as "an incorrigible offender, who 
had unfortunately to be endured but who could not be incorporated into the social 
life of the group" (1977:72). After several months of "uneasiness,'� the Inuit began 
to avoid her, and expressed their wish that she leave. Eventually, however, she was 
able to satisfactorily explain her behavior and achieved a rapprochement with them. 
Briggs concluded: "Although an anthropologist must have a recognized role or roles 
in order to make it possible to interact with him sensibly and predictably, never­
theless it will be evident from what I have described of my own case that the assign­
ment of a role may create as many problems as it solves for both the anthropologist 
and his hosts" ( 1977:78). 
Similarly, William and Margaret Rodman (1990) suffered a loss of rapport in 
their relationship with their research participants. While conduc ting fieldwork on 
the small South Pacific island of Ambae in 1985, Margaret contracted malaria and 
nearly died. The tribe insisted that her illness was caused by a wande, or river spirit. 
In a "failure to believe" the Rodmans chose not to rely on the local cures their 
research participants insisted they use, and instead went to a hospital. This caused 
a falling-out with the tribe, particularly the chief they were living with. They lost 
rapport and had to leave the field for health reasons, and thus ended their fieldwork 
on Ambae. 
In this part of the reader, we present three articles which illustrate and explore 
important dimensions of fieldwork relations and rapport -Charles Wagley's 

INTRODUCTION 123 
"Champukwi of the Village of the Tapirs" (1960), Gerald Berreman's "Behind Many 
Masks: Ethnography and Impression Management" (1972), and Antonius Robben's 
"Ethnog raphic Seduction, Transference, and Resistance in Dialogues About Terror 
and Violence in Argentina" (1996). 
Published in 1960, Wagley's account of his fieldwork in 1939 in a small village 
of about 175 Tapirape Indians in Brazil comes from the first volume dedicated 
to exploring field relationships between anthropologists and key informants 
(Casagrande 1960). He chose his relationship with Champukwi for this article 
because he "became my best informant, and after a time, an inseparable compan­
ion" (1960:400), and "for the brief span of about a year, he was my most intimate 
friend" (1960:398). But their close association began to cause trouble, and they had 
a falling-out. Champukwi was an inveterate Lothario who gave his paramours beads 
which Wagley had given him. This caused stress between him and Wagley because 
"as people continued to criticize Champukwi, much of their criticism [revolved] 
around his relationship with me" (1960:408). Nonetheless, their relationship con­
tinued, and Champukwi gradually evolved from being not only a friend and anthro­
pological informant but also a field assistant. Wagley reflects that: 
In the security of our studies and in the classroom, we claim that anthropology is a 
social science ... But, at its source, in the midst of the people with whom the anthro­
pologist lives and works, field research involves the practice of an art in which emo­
tions, subjective attitudes and reactions, and undoubtedly subconscious motivations 
participate ... Anthropological field research is a profoundly human endeavor ... the 
anthropologist almost inevitably is involved in a complex set of human relations among 
another people . . . and each anthropologist is a distinctive personality and each 
undoubtedly handles in his own way his dual role as a sympathetic friend to key infor­
mants and as scientific observer of a society and culture which is not his own. 
(1960:414-15) 
Wagley concludes with a deeply personal reflection on his relationship with this 
"key informant," which expresses the fundamentally human nature of the face-to­
face encounter in ethnographic fieldwork: "To me, Champukwi was, above all, a 
friend whom I shall remember always with warm affection" (1960:415). 
Gerald Berreman' s "Behind Many Masks" was published as the prologue to his 
outstanding ethnography Hindus of the Himalayas (1972). In the Preface to the 
second edition, he states: 
I believe firmly that ethnography cannot be understood independently of the experi­
ence which produces it. just as I felt obliged to be thorough and candid in presenting 
my research findings, so I have felt obliged to be thorough and candid about how I did 
that research. If fault be found with the former, it is the result of the latter. Written 
from an "interactionist" perspective, "Behind Many Masks" emphasizes the problems 
for research generated by the conflicting interests of the various castes and by their 
divergent culture and lifestyles, because even in small and isolated Sirkanda, social het­
erogeneity loomed as a major obstacle to my rapport and my understanding, just as it 
does to the people's relationships with one another. (1972:vi-vii) 
Berreman presents a case study and analysis of "some of the problem s and conse­
quences inherent in the interaction of ethnographer and subjects," particularly the

differential effects of his identification with high- and low-status groups in the village 
(1972:xix}. 
As a result of the fact that Hindu villages in India are divided within themselves 
along caste, religious, and other lines, "acceptance by one element of the commu­
nity does not imply acceptance by the whole community and it frequently , in fact, 
precludes it" (1972:xxii). Berreman was not "adopted" by the locals, but he 
describes how he was able to establish acceptance and rapport in the village, and 
is candid about the nature of this relationship: 
Although I remained an alien and was never made to feel that my presence in the village 
was actively desired by most of its members, I was thereafter tolerated with consider­
able indulgence. I became established as a resident of Sirkanda, albeit a peculiar one, 
and no one tried to get me to leave. I have heard strangers ... inquire of Sirkanda vil­
lagers as to my identity ... and be left to ponder the succinct reply, "He lives here." 
( 1972:xxvii) 
At different times during his fieldwork, Berreman employed two interpreter assis­
tants - a Brahmin who became ill four months into the research and a Muslim who 
replaced him. Berreman applies Erving· GoHman's interactionist model of "impres­
sion management" to reflect on the implications for his research of the differences 
in status of these two assistants. Pronounced stratification in the village meant that 
there were many competing groups or "teams," including the ethnographer and his 
research assistants, the village as a whole, low-caste and low-status villagers, and 
high-caste villagers. Berreman found that his interaction with these teams was dif­
ferent and the use of the two assistants had different effects when working with 
each team. 
Today, the communities with which cultural anthropologists do research are 
nearly always stratified, plural, and internally divided, and relations have to be 
maintained with different factions and interest groups who may be in conflict or 
competition with each other. Establishing acceptance and working ' relationships 
with both a community as a whole and the various factions within it is frequently 
a difficult goal to achieve. 
This reality, of the competing interests of research participants, is also apparent 
in Antonius Robben's article "Ethnographic Seduction, Transference, and Resistance 
in Dialogues about Terror and Violence in Argenti na." Usually, cultural anthropol­
ogists do fieldwork with people they like, respect, or even admire, but Robben raises 
the issue of establishing research relationships with people you do not like and 
whom you may even consider to be morally reprehen sible. As a result of his field­
work with both victims and perpetrators of violence during the "dirty war" in 
Argentina, Robben warns of the dangers of ''ethnographic seduction," which he 
defines as "a complex dynamic of conscious moves and unconscious defenses that 
may arise in interviews with victims and perpetrators of violence" (1996:72) and 
which undermine critical detachment (see also Robben 1995). Few anthropologists 
have had his experience: "There were days when I talked in the morning to a victim 
of political persecution and in the afternoon with a military officer who had been 
responsible for the repression. These days· were stressful because they demanded 
radical swings in empathetic understanding" (1996:97). 

INTRODUGION 125 
Robben was already sensitive to the risks to objectivity in doing research with 
victims of state terror, aware that it is easy in face-to-face research to be "seduced" 
by their obvious emotion and suffering. But he did not anticipate that this would 
be a problem when "studying up" state terrorists . He found that it was. The general 
and other military officers treated him well and with respect, and stressed their class 
affinities with him (well educated, elite, bourgeois ): "Although my initial sympathy 
and tolerance of personal idiosyncrasies was greater with members of human rights 
organizations than with the armed forces, I soon met officers whose politics I 
detested but for whom I felt a personal liking" (1996:99-100}. 
Once sensitized to this, Robben then found that he also recognized it in his sub­
sequent meetings with bishops, human rights activists, and former guerrilla leaders, 
and that "each group was seductive in its own way" (1995:83). He observes that 
"It is much easier to acknowledge manipulation by victimizers than by victims. We 
have more sympathy for unmasking abuses of power than doubting the words of 
their victims. I have the same sympathies" (1995 :84 ). Robben argues that seduc­
tion "disarms our critical detachment" (1996:86), and that "victims may be harmed 
and their testimonies discredited if we report their views naively and uncritically" 
(1995 :84 ). 
Robben' s article not only exemplifies some of the problems of establishing rapport 
and fieldwork relations in contexts of political violence, state repression, and 
popular resistance, but also the expanding venues of fieldwork into war zones and 
sites of violent conflict (cf. Nordstrom and Robben 1995), where there are major 
· divisions between the parties to the conflict, and it is almost impossible to establish 
and subsequently maintain research relationships with both at the same time.
