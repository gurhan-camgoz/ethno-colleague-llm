Custer Died for Your Sins 
Vine Deloria, Jr. 
Into each life, it is said, some rain must fall. 
Some people have bad horoscopes; others take 
tips on ·the stock market. McNamara created 
the TFX and the Edsel. American politics has 
George Wallace. But Indians have been cursed 
above all other people in history. Indians have 
anthropologists. .. 
Every summer when school is out, a stream 
of immigrants heads into Indian country. The 
Oregon Trail was never as heavily populated 
as Route 66 and Highway 18 in the summer­
time. From every rock and cranny in the East, 
they emerge, as if responding to some primeval 
migratory longing, and flock to the reserva­
tions. They are the anthropologists -the most 
prominent members of the scholarly commu­
nity that infests the land of the free and the 
homes of the braves. Their origin is a mystery 
hidden in the historical mists. Indians are 
certain that all ancient societies of the Near 
East had anthropologists at one time, because 
all those societies are now defunct. They are 
equally certain that Columbus brought anthro­
pologists on his ships when he came to the 
New World. How else could he have made so 
many wrong deductions about where he was? 
While their origins are uncertain, anthropolo­
gists can readily be identified on the reserva­
tions. Go into any crowd of people. Pick out 
a tall, gaunt white man wearing Bermuda 
shorts, a World War Two Army Air Corps flying jacket, an Australian bush hat and tennis 
shoes and packing a large knapsack incorrectly 
strapped on his back. He will invariably have 
a thin, sexy wife with stringy hair, an IQ of 
191 and a vocabulary in which even the prepo­
sitions have 11 syllables. And he usually has a 
camera, tape recorder, telescope, and life jacket 
all hanging from his elongated frame. 
This odd creature comes to Indian reserva­
tions to make observations. During the winter, 
these observations will become books by 
which future anthropologists will be trained, 
so that they can come out to reservations years 
from now and verify the observations in more 
books, summaries of which then appear in the 
scholarly journals and serve as a catalyst to 
inspire yet other anthropologists to make the 
great pilgrimage the following summer . And 
so on. 
The summaries, meanwhile, are condensed. 
Some condensations are sent to Government 
agencies as reports justifying the previous 
summer's research. Others are sent to founda­
tions, in an effort to finance the following 
summer's expedition West. The reports are 
spread through the Government agencies and 
foundations all winter. The only problem is 
that no one has time to read them. So $5,000-
a-year secretaries are assigned to decode them. 
Since these secretaries cannot comprehend 
complex theories, they reduce the reports to

the best slogans possible. The slogans become 
conference themes in the early spring, when 
the anthropological expeditions are being 
planned. They then turn into battle cries of 
opposing groups of anthropologists who 
chance to meet on the reservations the follow­
mg summer. 
Each summer there is a new battle cry, 
which inspires new insights into the nature of 
the "Indian problem." One summer Indians 
wilJ be greeted with the joyful cry "Indians are 
bilingual !" The following summer this great 
truth will be expanded to "Indians are not 
only bilingual, they are bicultural!" Bicul­
turality creates great problems for the oppos­
ing anthropological camp. For two summers, 
they have been bested in sloganeering and their 
funds are running low. So the opposing school 
of thought breaks into the clear faster than 
Gale Sayers. "Indians," the losing anthros cry, 
"are a folk people!" The tide of battle turns 
and a balance, so dearly sought by Mother 
Nature, is finally achieved. Thus go the 
anthropological wars, testing whether this 
school or that school can long endure. The bat­
tlefields, unfortunat ely, are the lives of Indian 
people. 
The anthro is usually devoted to pure 
research. A 1969 thesis restating a proposition 
of 1773, complete with footnotes to all mate­
rial published between 1773 and 1969, is pure 
research. There are, however, anthropologists 
who are not clever at collecting footnotes. 
They depend on their field observations and 
write long, adventurous narratives in which 
their personal observations are used to verify 
their suspicions. Their reports, books and arti­
cles are called applied research. The difference, 
then, between pure and applied research is pri­
marily one of footnotes. Pure has many foot­
notes, applied has few footnotes. Relevancy to 
subject matter is not discussed in polite 
company. 
Anthropologists came to Indian country 
only after the tribes had agreed to live on reser­
vations and had given up their warlike ways. 
Had the tribes been given a choice of fighting 
the cavalry or the anthropologists, there is 
little doubt as to who they would have chosen. 
In a crisis situation, men always attack the 
biggest threat to their existence. A warrior 
killed in battle could always go to the happy hunting grounds. But where does an Indian 
laid low by an anthro go? To the library? 
The fundamental thesis of the anthropolo­
gist is that people are objects for observation. 
It then follows that people are considered 
objects for experimentation, for manipulat ion, 
and for eventual extinction. The anthropolo­
gist thus furnishes the justification for treating 
Indian people like so many chessmen, available 
for anyone to play with. The mass production 
of useless knowledge by anthropologists 
attempting to capture real Indians in a network 
of theories has contributed substantially to the 
invisibility of Indian people today. After all, 
who can believe in the actual existence of a 
food-gathering, berrypicking, seminomadic, 
fire-worshiping, high-plains-and-m ountain­
dwelling, horse-riding, canoe-toting, bead­
using, pottery-making, ribbon-coveting, 
wickiup-sheltered people who began flourish­
ing when Alfred Frump mentioned them in 
1803 in Our Feathered Friends? 
Not even Indians can see themselves as this 
type of creature -who, to anthropologists, is 
the "real" Indian. Indian people begin to feel 
that they are merely shadows of a mythical 
super-Indian. Many Indians, in fact, have come 
to parrot the ideas of anthropologists, because 
it appears that they know everything about 
Indian communities. Thus, many ideas that 
pass for Indian thinking are in reality theories 
originally advanced by anthropologists and 
echoed by Indian people in an attempt to com­
municate the real situation. Many anthros 
reinforce this sense of inadequacy in order to 
further influence the Indian people. 
Since 1955, there have been a number of 
workshops conducted in Indian country as a 
device for training "young Indian leaders." 
Churches, white Indian-interest groups, col­
leges, and, finally, poverty programs have each 
gone the workshop route as the most feasible 
means for introducing new ideas to younger 
Indians, so as to create leaders. The tragic 
nature of the workshops is apparent when one 
examines their history. One core group of 
anthropologists has institutionalized the work­
shop and the courses taught in it. Trudging 
valiantly from workshop to workshop, from 
state· to state, college to college, tribe to tribe, 
these noble spirits have served as the catalyst 
for the creation of workshops that are identi-

· CUSTER DIED FOR YOUR SINS 185 
cal in purpose and content and ohen in the 
student-body itself. 
The anthropological message to young 
Indians has not varied a jot or a tittle in ten 
years. It is the same message these anthros 
learned as fuzzy-cheeked graduate students in 
the post-War years -Indians are a folk people, 
whites are an urban people, and never the 
twain shaJl meet. Derived from this basic 
premise are all the other sterling insights: 
Indians are between two cultures, Indians are 
bicultural, Indians have lost their identity, and 
Indians are warriors. These theories, pro­
pounded every year with deadening regularity 
and an overtone of Sinaitic authority, have 
become a major mental block in the develop­
ment of young Indian people. For these slogans 
have come to be excuses for Indian failures. 
They are crutches by which young Indians 
have ·avoided the arduous task of thinking out 
the implications of the status of Indian people 
in the modem world. 
If there is one single cause that has impor­
tance today for Indian people, it is tribalism. 
Against all odds, Indians have retained title to 
some 53,000,000 acres of land, worth about 
three and a half billion dollars. Approximately 
half of the country ,s 1,000,000 Indians relate 
meaningfully to this land, either by living and 
working on it or by frequently visiting it. If 
Indians fully recaptured the idea that they are 
tribes communally in possession of this land, 
they would realize that they are not truly 
impoverished. But the creation of modern trib­
alism has been stifled by a ready acceptance of 
the Indians-are-a-folk-people premise of the 
anthropologists. This premise implies a drastic 
split between folk and urban cultures, in which 
the folk peoples have two prime characteris­
tics: They dance and they are desperately poor. 
Creative thought in Indian affairs has not, 
therefore, come from the younger Indians who 
have grown up reading and talking to anthro­
pologists. Rather, it has come from the older 
generation that believes in tribalism -and that 
the youngsters mistakenly insist has been 
brainwashed by Government schools. 
Because other groups have been spurred on 
by their younger generations, Indians have 
come to believe that, through education, a new 
generation of leaders will arise to solve 
the pressing contemporary problems. Tribal leaders have been taught to accept this thesis 
by the scholarly community in its annual inva­
sion of the reservations. Bureau of Indian 
Affairs educators harp continuously on this 
theme. Wherever authority raises its head in 
Indian country , this thesis is its message. The 
facts prove the opposite, however. Relatively 
untouched by anthropologists, educators, and 
scholars are the Apache tribes of the South­
west. The Mescalero, San Carlos, White 
Mountain, and Jicarilla Apaches have very few 
young people in college, compared with other 
tribes. They have even fewer people in the 
annual workshop orgy during the summers. 
If ever there was a distinction between folk 
and urban, this group of Indians characterizes 
it. 
The Apaches see themselves, however , as 
neither folk nor urban but tribal. There is little 
sense of a lost identity. Apaches could not care 
less about the anthropological dilemmas that 
worry other tribes. Instead, they continue to 
work on massive plans for development that 
they themselves have created. Tribal identity is 
assumed, not defined, by these reservation 
people. Freedom to choose from a wide variety 
of paths of progress is a characteristic of the 
Apaches; they don,t worry about what type of 
Indianism is real. Above all, they cannot be 
ego-fed by abstract theories and, hence, unwit­
tedly manipulated. 
With many young people from other tribes, 
the situation is quite different. Some young 
Indians attend workshops over and over again. 
Folk theories pronounced by authoritative 
anthropologists become opporturuttes to 
escape responsibility. If, by definition, the 
Indian is hopelessly caught between two cul­
tures, why struggle? Why not blame all one,s 
lack of success on this tremendous gulf 
between two opposing cultures? Workshops 
have become, therefore, summer retreats for 
nonthought rather than strategy sessions for 
leadership. Therein lies the Indian,s sin against 
the anthropologist. Only those anthropolo­
gists who appear to boost Indian ego and 
expound theories dear to the hearts of work­
shop Indians are invited to teach at work­
shops. They become human recordings of 
social confusion and are played and replayed 
each summer, to the delight of a people who 
refuse to move on into the real world. 

186 VINE DELORIA, JR. 
The workshop anthro is thus a unique crea­
ture, partially self-created and partially sup­
ported by the refusal of Indian young people 
to consider their problems in their own 
context. The normal process of maturing has 
been confused with cultural difference. So mat­
uration is cast aside in favor of cult recitation 
of great truths that appear to explain the 
immaturity of young people. 
While the-anthro is thus, in a sense, the 
victim of the Indians, he should, nevertheless, 
recognize the role he has been asked to play 
and refuse to play it. Instead, the temptation 
to appear relevant to a generation of young 
Indians has clouded his sense of proport ion. 
Workshop anthros often ask Indians of tender 
age to give their authoritative answers to prob­
lems that an entire generation of Indians is just 
now beginning to solve. Where the answer to 
reservation health problems may be adequate 
housing in areas where there has never been 
adequate housing, young Indians are shaped in 
their thinking processes to consider vague doc­
trines on the nature of man and his society. 
It is preposterous that a teen-aged Indian 
should become an instant authority, equal in 
status to the PhD interrogating him. Yet the 
very human desire is to play that game every 
summe� for the status acquired in the game is 
heady. And since answers can be given only in 
the vocabulary created by the PhD, the entire 
leadership-training process internalizes itself 
and has no outlet beyond the immediate 
group. Real problem� superimposed on the 
ordinary problems of maturing, thus become 
insoluble burdens that crush people of great 
leadership potential. 
Let us take some specific examples. One 
workshop discussed the thesis that Indians 
were in a terrible crisis. They were, in the 
words of friendly anthro guides, "between two 
worlds.,., People between two worlds, the stu­
dents were told, "drank." For the anthropol­
ogist, it was a valid explanation of drinking on 
the reservation. For the young Indians, it was 
an authoritative definition of their role as 
Indians. Real Indians, they began to think, 
drank; and their task was to become real 
Indians, for only in that way could they recre­
ate the glories of the past. So they drank. I've 
lost some good friends who drank too much. Abstract theories create abstract action. 
Lumping together the variety of tribal prob­
lems and seeking the demonic principle at 
work that is destroying Indian people may be 
intellectually satisfying, but it does not change 
the situation. By concentrating on great 
abstractions, anthropologists have uninten­
tionally removed many young Indians from 
the world of real problems to the lands of 
make-believe. 
As an example of a real problem, the 
Pyramid Lake Paiutes and the Gila River Pima 
and Maricopa are poor because they have 
been systematically cheated out of their water 
rights, and on desert reservations, water is the 
single most important factor in life. No matter 
how many worlds Indians straddle, the Plains 
Indians have an inadequate land base that con­
tinues to shrink because of land sales. Strad­
dl.ing worlds is irrelevant to straddling smaJI 
pieces of land and trying to earn a living. 
Along the Missouri River, the Sioux used 
to live in comparative peace and harmony. 
Although land allotments were small, families 
were able to achieve a fair standard of living 
through a combination of gardening and live­
stock raising and supplemental work. Little 
cash income was required, because the basic 
necessities of food, shelter, and community life 
were provided. After World War Two, anthro­
pologists came to call. They were horrified that 
the Indians didn't carry on their old customs, 
such as dancing, feasts, and giveaways. In fact, 
the people did keep up a substantial number 
of customs, but they had been transposed into 
church gatherings, participation in the county 
fairs, and tribal celebrations, particularly fairs 
and rodeos. The people did Indian dances. But 
they didn't do them all the time. 
Suddenly, the Sioux were presented with an 
authority figure who bemoaned the fact that 
whenever he visited the reservati ons, the Sioux 
were not out dancing in the manner of their 
ancestors. Today, the summers are taken up 
with one great orgy of dancing and celebrat­
ing, as each small community of Indians spon­
sors a weekend powwow for the people in the 
surrounding communities. Gone are the little 
gardens that used to provide fresh vegetables 
in the summer and canned goods in the winter. 
Gone are the chickens that provided eggs and 

_ CUSTER DIED FOR YOUR SINS 187 
Sunday dinners. In the winter, the situation 
becomes critical for families who spent the 
summer dancing. While the poverty programs 
have done much to counteract the situation, 
few Indians recognize that the condition was 
artificial from start to finish. The people were 
innocentl y led astray, and even the anthropol­
ogists did not realize what had happened. 
One example: The Oglala Sioux are perhaps 
the most well known of the Sioux bands. 
Among their past leaders were Red Cloud, the 
only Indian who ever defeated the United 
States in a war, and Crazy Horse, most revered 
of the Sioux war chiefs. The Oglala were, and 
perhaps stili are, the meanest group of Indians 
ever assembled. They would take after a 
cavalry troop just to see if their bowstrings 
were taut enough. When they had settled on 
the reservation, the Oglala made a fairly 
smooth transition to the new life. They had 
good herds of cattle, they settled along the 
numerous creeks that cross the reservation, 
and they created a very strong community 
spirit. The Episcopalians and the Roman 
Catholics had the missionary franchise on the 
reservation and the tribe was pretty evenly 
split between the two. In the Episcopal 
Church, at least, the congregations were fairly 
self-governing and stable. 
But over the years, the Oglala Sioux have 
had a number of problems. Their population 
has grown faster than their means of support. 
The Government allowed white farmers to 
come into the eastern part of the reservation 
and create a county, with the best farmlands 
owned or operated by whites. The reservation 
was allotted -taken out of the collective hands 
of the tribe and parceled out to individuals -
and when ownership became too complicated, 
control of the land passed out of Indian hands. 
The Government displaced a number of 
families during World War Two by taking a 
part of the reservation for use as a bombing 
range to train crews for combat. Only last year 
was this land returned to tribal and individual 
use. 
The tribe became a favorite subject for 
anthropological study quite early, because of 
its romantic past. Theories arose attempting to 
explain the apparent lack of progress of the 
Oglala Sioux. The true issue -white control of the reservation - was overlooked completely. 
Instead, every conceivable intangible cultural 
distinction was used to explain the lack of eco­
nomic, social, and educational progress of a 
people who were, to all intents and purposes, 
absentee lancllords because of the Government 
policy of leasing their lands to whites. 
One study advanced the startling proposi­
tion that Indians with many cattle were, on the 
average, better off than Indians without cattle. 
Cattle Indians, it seems, had more capital and 
income than did noncattle Indians. Surprise! 
The study had innumerable charts and graphs 
that demonstrated this great truth beyond the 
doubt of a reasonably prudent man. Studies of 
this type were common but unexciting. They 
lacked that certain flair of insight so beloved 
by anthropologists. Then one day a famous 
anthropologist advanced the theory, probably 
valid at the time and in the manner in which 
he advanced it, that the Oglala were "warriors 
without weapons." 
The chase was on. Before the ink had dried 
on the scholarly journals, anthropologists 
from every library stack in the nation con­
verged on the Oglala Sioux to test this new 
theory. Outfitting anthropological expeditions 
became the number-one industry of the small 
off-reservation Nebraska towns south of Pine 
Ridge. Surely, supplying the Third Crusade to 
the Holy Land was a minor feat compared 
with the task of keeping the anthropologists at 
Pine Ridge. 
Every conceivable difference between the 
Oglala Sioux and the folks at Bar Harbor was 
attributed to the quaint warrior tradition of 
the Oglala Sioux. From lack of roads to 
unshined shoes, Sioux problems were gener­
ated, so the anthros discovered, by the refusal 
of the white man to recognize the great desire 
of the Oglala to go to war. Why expect an 
Oglala to become a small businessman, when 
he was only waiting for that wagon train to 
come around the bend? The very real and 
human problems of the reservation were con­
sidered to be merely by-products of the failure 
of a warrior people to become domesticated. 
The fairly respectable thesis of past exploits in 
war, perhaps romanticized for morale pur­
poses, became a spiritual force all its own. 
Some Indians, in a tongue-in-cheek manner for 

188 VINE DELORIA, JR. 
which Indians are justly famous, suggested 
that a subsidized wagon train be run through 
the reservation each morning at nine o'clock 
and the reservation people paid a minimum 
wage for attacking it. 
By outlining this problem, I am not deriding 
the Sioux. I lived on that reservation for 18 
years and know many of the problems from 
which it suffers. How, I ask, can the Oglala 
Sioux make any headway in education when 
their lack of education is ascribed to a desire 
to go to war? Would not, perhaps, an incred­
ibly low per-capita income, virtually nonexis­
tent housing, extremely inadequate roads, and 
domination by white farmers and ranchers 
make some difference? If the little Sioux boy 
or girl had no breakfast, had to walk miles to 
a small school, and had no decent clothes nor 
place to study in a one-room log cabin, should 
the level of education be comparable with that 
of Scarsdale High? 
What use would roads, houses, schools, 
businesses, and income be to a people who, 
everyone expected, would soon depart on the 
warpath? I would submit that a great deal of 
the lack of progress at Pine Ridge is occasioned 
by people who believe they are helping the 
Oglala when they insist on seeing, in the life 
of the people of that reservati on, only those 
things they want to see. Real problems and real 
people become invisible before the great 
romantic and nonsensical notion that the 
Sioux yearn for the days of Crazy Horse and 
Red Cloud and will do nothing until those 
days return. 
The question of the Oglala Sioux is one that 
plagues every Indian tribe in the nation, if it 
will closely examine itself. Tribes have been 
defined; the definition has been completely 
explored; test-scores have been advanced pro­
moting and deriding the thesis; and, finally, the 
conclusion has been reached; Indians must be 
redefined in terms that white men will accept, 
even if that means re-Indianizing them accord­
ing to the white man's idea of what they were 
like in the past and should logically become in 
the future. 
What, I ask, would a school board in 
Moline, Illinois -or Skokie, even - do if the 
scholarly community tried to reorient its edu­
cational system to conform with outmoded 
ideas of Sweden in the glory days of Gustavus Adolphus? Would they be expected to sing 
"Ein' feste Burg" and charge out of the mists 
at the Roman Catholics to save the Reforma­
tion every morning as school began? Or the 
Irish -would they submit to a group of Indians 
coming to Boston and telling them to dress in 
green and hunt leprechauns? 
Consider the implications of theories put 
forward to solve the problem of poverty among 
the blacks. Several years ago, the word went 
forth that black poverty was due to the 
disintegration of the black family, that the 
black father no longer had a prominent place 
in the home. How incredibly shortsighted that 
thesis was. How typically Anglo-Saxon! How 
in the world could there have been a black 
family if people were sold like cattle for 200 
years, if there were large plantations that 
served merely as farms to breed more slaves, if 
white owners systematica lly ravaged black 
women? When did the black family unit ever 
-become integrated? Herein lies a trap into 
which many Americans have fallen: Once a 
problem is defined and understood by a signif­
icant number of people who have some rela­
tion to it, the fallacy goes, the problem ceases 
to exist. The rest of America had better beware 
of having quaint mores that attract anthropol­
ogists, or it will soon become a victim of 
the conceptual prison into which blacks and 
Indians, among others, have been thrown. One 
day you may find yourself cataloged-perhaps 
as a credit-card-carrying, turnpike-commuting, 
condominium -dwelling, fraternity-joining, 
_ church-going, sports-watching, time-purchase­
buying, television-watching, magazine­
subscribing, politically inert transmigrated 
urbanite who, through the phenomenon of the 
second car and the shopping center, has 
become a golf-playing, wife-swapping, etc., 
etc., etc., suburbanite. Or have you already 
been characterized -and caricatured -in ways 
that struck you as absurd? If so, you will under­
stand what has been happening to Indians for 
a long, long time. 
In defense of the anthropologists, it must be 
recognized that those who do not publish 
perish. Those who do not bring in a substan­
tial sum of research money soon slide down 
the scale of university approval. What univer­
sity is not equally balanced between the actual 
education of its students and a multitude of 

_ CUSTER DIED FOR YOUR SINS 189 
small bureaus, projects, institutes, and pro­
grams that are designed to harvest grants for 
the university? 
The effect of anthropologists on Indians 
should be clear. Compilation of useless knowl­
edge for knowledge's sake should be utterly 
rejected by the Indian people. We should not 
be objects of observation for those who do 
nothing to help us. During the critical days of 
1954, when the Senate was pushing for termi­
nation of all Indian rights, not one scholar, 
anthropologist, sociologist, historian, or econ­
ornist came forward to support the tribes 
against the detrimental policy. Why didn't the 
academic community march to the side of the 
tribes? Certainly the past few years have 
shown how much influence academe can exert 
when it feels compelled to enlist in a cause. Is 
Viemam any more crucial to the moral stance 
of America than the great debt owed to the 
Indian tribes? 
Perhaps we should suspect the motives of 
members of the academic communi ty. They 
have the Indian field well defined and under 
control. Their concern� is not the ultimate 
policy that will affect the Indian people, but 
merely the creation of new slogans and doc­
trines by which they can climb the university 
totem pole. Reduction of people to statistics 
for purposes of observation appears to be 
inconsequential to the anthropologist when 
compared with the immediate benefits he can 
derive-the acquisition of further prestige and 
the chance to appear as the high priest of 
American society, orienting and manipul ating 
to his heart's desire. 
Roger Jourdain, chairman of the Red Lake 
Chippewa tribe of Minnesota, casually had the 
anthropologists escorted from his reservation 
a couple of years ago. This was the tip of the 
iceberg. If only more Indians had the insight 
of Jourdain. Why should we continue to 
provide private zoos for anthropologists? Why 
should tribes have to compete with scholars 
for funds, when their scholarly productions 
are so useless and irrelevant to life? 
Several years ago, an anthropologist stated 
that over a period of some 20 years he had 
spent, from all sources, close to $10,000,000 
studying a tribe of fewer than 1000 people. 
Imagine what that amount of money would 
have meant to that group of people had it been invested in buildings and businesses. There 
would have been no problems to study. 
I sometimes think that Indian tribes could 
improve relations between themselves and the 
anthropologists by adopting the following 
policy: Each anthro desiring to study a tribe 
should be made to apply to the tribal council 
for permission to do his study. He would be 
given such permission only if he raised as a 
contribution to the tribal budget an amount of 
money equal to the amount he proposed to 
spend on his study. Anthropologists would 
thus become productive members of Indian 
society, instead of ideological vultures. 
This proposal was discussed at one time in 
Indian circles. It blew no small number of 
anthro minds. Irrational shrieks of "academic 
freedom" rose like rockets from launching 
pads. The very idea of putting a tax on useless 
information was intolerable to the anthropol­
ogists we talked with. But the question is very 
simple. Are the anthros concerned about 
freedom-or license? Academic freedom cer­
tainly does not imply that one group of people 
has to become chessmen for another group of 
people. Why should Indian communities be 
subjected to prying non-Indians any more than 
other communities? Should any group have a 
franchise to stick its nose into someone else's 
business? 
I don't think my proposal ever will be 
accepted. It contradicts the anthropologists' 
self-image much too strongly. What is more 
likely is that Indians will continue to allow 
their communities to be turned inside out until 
they come to realize the damage that is being 
done to them. Then they will seal up the reser­
vations and no further knowledge -useless or 
otherwise -will be created. This may be the 
best course. Once, at a Congressional hearing, 
someone asked Alex Chasing Hawk, a council 
member of the Cheyenne Sioux for 30 years, 
"Just what do you Indians want?" Alex 
replied, "A leave-us-alone law.,, 
The primary goal and need of Indians today 
is not for someone to study us, feel sorry for 
us, identify with us, or claim descent from 
Pocahontas to make us feel better. Nor do we 
need to be classified as semiwhite and have 
programs made to bleach us further. Nor 
do we need further studies to see if we are 
"feasible., We need, instead, a new policy

from Congress that acknowledges our intelli­
gence, and our dignity. 
In its simplest form, such a policy would 
give a tribe the amount of money now being 
spent in the area on Federal schools and other 
services. With this block grant, the tribe itself 
would communally establish and run its own 
schools and hospitals and police and fire 
departments -and, in time, its own income­
producing endeavors , whether in industry or 
agriculture. The tribe would not be taxed until 
enough capital had accumulated so that indi­
vidual Indians were getting fat dividends. 
Many tribes are beginning to acquire the 
skills necessary for this sort of independence., 
but the odds are long: An Indian district at 
Pine Ridge was excited recently about the pos­
sibility of running its own schools, and a bond 
issue was put before them that would have 
made it possible for them to do so. In the meantime, however, anthropologists vts1tmg 
the community convinced its people that they 
were culturally unprepared to assume this son 
of responsibility; so the tribe voted down the 
bond issue. Three universities have sent teams 
to the area to discover why the issue was 
defeated. The teams are planning to spend 
more on their studies than the bond issue 
would have cost. 
I would expect an instant rebuttal by the 
anthros. They will say that my sentiments do 
not represent the views of all Indians -and 
they are right, they have brainwashed many of 
my brothers. But a new day is coming. Until 
then, it would be wise for anthropologists to 
climb down from their thrones of authority 
and pure research and begin helping Indian 
tribes instead of preying on them. For the 
wheel of karma grinds slowly, but it does grind 
fipe. And it makes a complete circle.
