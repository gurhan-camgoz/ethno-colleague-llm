Method and Scope of 
Anthropol ogical Fieldwork

Imagine yourself suddenly set down sur­
rounded by all your gear, alone on a tropical 
beach close to a native village, while the launch 
or dinghy which has brought you sails away 
out of sight. Since you take up your abode in 
the compound of some neighbouring white 
man, trader or missionary, you have nothing 
to do, but to start at once on your ethno­
graphic work. Imagine further that you are a 
beginner, without previous experience, with 
nothing to guide you and no one to help you. 
For the white man is temporarily absent, or 
else unable or unwilling to waste any of his 
time on you. This exactly describes my first ini­
tiation into fieldwork on the south coast of 
New Guinea. I well remember the long visits I 
paid to the villages during the first weeks; the 
feeling of liopelessness and despair after many 
obstinate but futile attempts had entirely failed 
to bring me into real touch with the natives, 
or supply me with any material. I had periods 
of desponden cy, when I buried myself in the 
reading of novels, as a man might take to drink 
in a fit of tropical depression and boredom. Imagine yourself then, making your first 
entry into the village, alone or in company 
with your white cicerone. Some natives flock 
round you, especially if they smell tobacco. 
Others, the more dignified and elderly, remain 
seated where they are. Your white companion 
has his routine way of treating the natives, and 
he neither understands, nor is very much con­
cerned with the manner in which you, as an 
ethnographer, will have to approach them. The 
first visit leaves you with a hopeful feeling that 
when you return alone, things will be easier. 
Such was my hope at least. 
I came back duly, and soon gathered an 
audience around me. A few cqmpliments in 
pidgin-English on both sides, some tobacco 
changing hands, induced an atmosphere of 
mutual amiability. I tried then to proceed to 
business. First, to begin with subjects which 
might arouse no suspicion, I started to "do" 
technology. A few natives were engaged in 
manufacturing some object or other. It was 
easy to look at it and obtain the names of the 
tools, and even some technical expressions 
about the proceedings, but there the matter 
ended. It must be borne in mind that pidgin­
English is a very imperfect instrument for 
expressing one's ideas, and that before one 
gets a good training in framing questions and

METHOD AND SCOPE OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL FIELDWORK 47 
understanding answers one has the uncom­
fortable feeling that free communication in it 
with the natives will never be attained; and 
I was quite unable to enter into any more 
detailed or explicit conversation with them at 
first. I knew well that the best remedy for this 
was to collect concrete data, and accordingly 
I took a village census, wrote down genealo­
gies, drew up plans and collected the terms of 
kinship. But all this remained dead material, 
which led no further into the understanding of 
real native mentality or behaviou r, since I 
could neither procure a good native interpre­
tation of any of these items, nor get what could 
be called the hang of tribal life. As to obtain­
ing their ideas about religion, and magic, their 
beliefs in sorcery and spirits, nothing was 
forthcoming except a few superficial items of 
folk-lore, mangled by being forced into pidgin 
English� 
Information which I received from some 
white residents in the district, valuable as it 
was in itself, was more discouraging than any­
thing else with regard to my own work. Here 
were men-who had lived for years in the place 
with constant opportunities of observing the 
natives and communicating with them, and 
who yet hardly knew one thing about them 
really well. How could I therefore in a few 
months or a year, hope to overtake and go 
beyond them? Moreover, the manner in which 
my white informants spoke about the natives 
and put their views was, naturally, that of 
untrained minds, unaccustomed to formulate 
their thoughts with any degree of consistency 
and precision. And they were for the most 
part, naturally enough, full of the biassed and 
pre-judged opinions inevitable in the average 
practical man, whether administrator, mis­
sionary, or trader, yet so strongly repulsive to 
a mind striving after the objective, scientific 
view of things. The habit of treating with a 
self-satisfied frivolity what is really serious to 
the ethnographer; the cheap rating of what to 
him is a scientific treasure, that is to say, the 
native's cultural and mental peculiarities and 
independence -these features, so well known 
in the inferior amateur's writing, I found in the 
tone of the majority of white residents.1 
Indeed, in my first piece of Ethnographic 
research on the South coast, it was not until I 
was alone in the district that I began to make some headway; and, at any rate, I found out 
where lay the secret of effective fieldwork. 
What is then this ethnographer's magic, by 
which he is able to evoke the real spirit of the 
natives, the true picture of tribal life? As usual, 
success can only be obtained by a patient and 
systematic application of a number of rules of 
common sense and well-known scientific prin­
ciples, and not by the discovery of any mar­
vellous short-cut leading to the desired results 
without effort or trouble. The principles of 
method can be grouped under three main 
headings; first of all, naturally, the student 
must possess real scientific aims, and know the 
values and criteria of modern ethnography. 
Secondly, he ought to put himself in good con­
ditions of work. that is, in the main, to live 
without other white men, right among the 
natives. Finally, he has to apply a number of 
special methods of collecting, manipulating 
and fixing his evidence. A few words must be 
said about these foundation stones of field­
work, beginning with the second as the most 
elementary. 
IV 
Proper conditions for 
ethnographic work 
These, as said, consist mainly in cutting oneself 
off from the company of other white men, and 
remaining in as close contact with the natives 
as possible, which really can only be achieved 
by camping right in their villages. It is very nice 
to have a base in a white man's compound for 
the stores, and to know there is a refuge there 
in times of sickness and surfeit of native. But 
it must be far enough away not to become a 
permanent milieu in which you live and from 
which you emerge at fixed hours only to "do 
the village." It should not even be near enough 
to fly to at any moment for recreation. For the 
native is not the natural companion for a white 
man, and after you have been working with 
him for several hours, seeing how he does his 
gardens, or letting him tell you items of folk­
lore, or discussing his customs, you will natu­
rally hanker after the company of your own 
kind. But if you are alone in a village beyond 
reach of this, you go for a solitary walk for an 

48 BRONISLAW MALINOWSKI 
hour or so, return again and then quite natu­
rally seek out the natives' society, this time as 
a relief from loneliness, just as you would any 
other companionship. And by means of this 
natural intercourse, you learn to know him, 
and you become familiar with his customs and 
beliefs far better than when he is a paid, and 
often bored, informant. 
There is _all the difference between a spo­
radic plunging into the company of natives, 
and being really in contact with them. What 
does this latter mean? On the Ethnographer's 
side, it means that his life in the village, which 
at first is a strange, sometimes unpleasant, 
sometimes intensely interesting adventure, 
soon adopts quite a natural course very much 
in harmony with his surroundings. 
Soon after I had established myself in 
Omarakana (Trobriand Islands), I began to 
take part, in a way, in the village life, to look 
forward to the important or festive events, to 
take personal interest in the gossip and the 
developments of the small village occurrences; 
to wake up every morning to a day, presenting 
itself to me more or less as it does to the native. 
I would get out from under my mosquito net, 
to find around me the village life beginning to 
stir, or the people well advanced in their 
working day according to the hour and also to 
the season, for they get up and begin their 
labours early or late, as work presses. As I 
went on my morning walk through the village, 
I could see intimate details of family life, of 
toilet, cooking, taking of meals; I could see the 
arrangements for the day's work, people start­
ing on their errands, or groups of men and 
women busy at some manufacturing tasks. 
Quarrels, jokes, family scenes, events usually 
trivial, sometimes dramatic but always signifi­
cant, formed the atmosphere of my daily life, 
as well as of theirs. It must be remembered that 
as the natives saw me constantly every day, 
they ceased to be interested or alarmed, or 
made self-conscious by my presence, and I 
ceased to be a disturbing element in the tribal 
life which I was to study, altering it by my very 
approach, as always happens with a new­
comer to every savage community. In fact, as 
they knew that I would thrust my nose into 
everything, even where a well-mannered native 
would not dream of intruding, they finished by 
regarding me as part and parcel of their life, a necessary evil or nuisance, mitigated by dona­
tions of tobacco. 
Later on in the day, whatever happened was 
within easy reac� and there was no possibil­
ity of its escaping my notice. Alarms about the 
sorcerer's approach in the evening, one or two 
big, really important quarrels and rifts within 
the commun ity, cases of illness, attempted 
cures and deaths, magical rites which had to 
be performed, all these I had not to pursue, 
fearful of missing them, but they took place 
under my very eyes, at my own doorstep, so 
to speak. And it must be emphasised whenever 
anything dramatic or important occurs it is 
essential to investigate it at the very moment 
of happening, because the natives cannot but 
talk about it, are too excited to be reticent, and 
too interested to be mentally lazy in supplying 
details. Also, over and over again, I commit­
ted breaches of etiquette, which the natives, 
familiar enough with me, were not slow in 
pointing out. I had to learn how to behave, 
and to a certain extent, I acquired "the feeling" 
for native good and bad manners. With this, 
and with the capacity of enjoying their 
company and sharing some of their games and 
amusements, I began to feel that I was indeed 
in touch with the natives, and this is certainly 
the preliminary condition of being able to 
carry on successful fieldwork. 
v 
But the Ethnographer has not only to spread 
his nets in the right place, and wait for what 
will fall into them. He must be an active hunts­
man, and drive his quarry into them and 
follow it up to its most inaccessible lairs. And 
that leads us to the more active methods of 
pursuing ethnographic evidence. It has been 
mentioned at the end of Division III that the 
Ethnographer has to be inspired by the knowl­
edge of the most modern results of scientific 
study, by its principles and aims. I shall not 
enlarge upon this subject, except by way of 
one remark, to avoid the possibility of mis­
understanding. Good training in theory, and 
acquaint ance with its latest results, is not iden­
tical with being burdened with "preconceived 
ideas." If a man sets out on an expedition, 
determined to prove certain hypotheses, if he 

METHOD AND -SCOPE OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL FIELDWORK 49 
is incapable of changing his views constantly 
and casting them off ungrudgingly under the 
pressure of evidence, needless to say his work 
will be worthless. But the more problems he 
brings with him into the field, the more he is 
in the habit of moulding his theories accord­
ing to facts, and of seeing facts in their bearing 
upon theory, the better he is equipped for the 
work. Preconceived ideas are pernicious in any 
scientific work, but foreshadowed problems 
are the main endowment of a scientific thinker, 
and these problems are first revealed to the 
observer by his theoretical studies. 
In Ethnology the early efforts of Bastian, 
Tylor, Morgan, the German Volkerpsycholo­
gen have remoulded the older crude informa­
tion of travellers, missionaries, etc., and have 
shown us the importance of applying deeper 
conceptions and discarding crude and mis­
leading ones.2 
The concept of animism superseded that of 
"fetichism" or "devil-worship," both mean­
ingless terms. The understanding of the classi­
ficatory systems of relationship paved the way 
.for the brilliant, modern researches on native 
sociology in the fieldwork of the Cambridge 
school. The psychological analysis of the 
German thinkers has brought forth an abun­
dant crop of most valuable information in the 
results obtained by the recent German ex­
peditions to Africa, South America and the 
Pacific, while the theoretical works of Frazer, 
Durkheim and others have already, and will no 
doubt still for a long time inspire fieldworkers 
and lead them to new results. The fieldworker 
relies entirely upon inspiration from theory. Of 
course he may be also a theoretical thinker and 
worker, and there he can draw on himself for 
stimulus. But the two functions are separate, 
and in actual research they have to be sepa­
rated both in time and conditions of work. 
As always happens when scientific interest 
turns towards and begins to labour on a field 
so far only prospected by the curiosity of ama­
teurs, Ethnology has introduced law and order 
into what seemed chaotic and freakish. It has 
transformed for us the sensational, wild and 
unaccountable world of "savages" into a 
number of well ordered communities, gov­
erned by law, behaving and thinking accord­
ing to consistent principles. The word 
"savage," whatever association it might have had original ly, connotes ideas of boundless 
liberty, of irregularity, of something extremely 
and extraordinarily quaint. In popular think­
ing, we imagine that the natives live on the 
bosom of Nature, more or less as they can and 
like, the prey of irregular , phantasmagoric 
beliefs and apprehensions. Modern science, on 
the contrary, shows that their social institu­
tions have a very definite organisation, that 
they are governed by authority, law and order 
in their public and personal relations, while 
the latter are, besides, under the control of 
extremely complex ties of kinship and clan­
ship. Indeed, we see them entangled in a mesh 
of duties, functions and privileges which cor­
respond to an elaborate tribal, communal and 
kinship organisation. Their beliefs and prac­
tices do not by any means lack consistency of 
a certain type, and their knowledge of the 
outer world is sufficient to guide them in many 
of their strenuous enterprises and activities. 
Their artistic productions again lack neither 
meaning nor beauty. 
It is a very far cry from the famous answer 
given long ago by a representative authority 
who, asked, what are the manners and 
customs of the natives, answered, "Customs 
none, manners beastly, " to the position of the 
modern Ethnographer! This latter, with his 
tables of kinship terms, genealogies, maps, 
plans and diagrams, proves the existence of an 
extensive and big organisation, shows the con­
stitution of the tribe, of the clan, of the family; 
and he gives us a picture of the natives sub­
jected to a strict code of behaviour and good 
manners, to which in comparison the life at the 
Court of Versailles or Escurial was free and 
easy.3 
Thus the first and basic ideal of ethno­
graphic fieldwork is to give a clear and firm 
ol]tline of the social constitution, and disen­
tangle the laws and regularities of all cultural 
phenomena from the irrelevances. The firm 
skeleton of the tribal life has to be first ascer­
tained. This ideal imposes in the first place the 
fundamental obligation of giving a complete 
survey of the phenomena, and not of picking 
out the sensational, the singular , still less the 
funny and quaint. The time when we could tol­
erate accounts presenting us the native as a dis­
torted, childish caricature of a human being 
are gone. This picture is false, and like many 

so BRONISL AW MALINOWSKI 
other falsehoods, it has been killed by Science. 
The field Ethnographer has seriously and 
soberly to cover the full extent of the phe­
nomena in each aspect of tribal culture 
studied, making no difference between what is 
commonplace, or drab, or ordinary, and what 
strikes him as astonishing and out-of-the-way. 
At the same time, the whole area of tribal 
culture in all its aspects has to be gone over in 
research. The consistency, the law and order 
which obtain within each aspect make also for 
joining them into one coherent whole. 
An Ethnographer who sets out to study only 
religion, or only technology, or only social 
organisation cuts out an artificial field for 
inquiry, and he will be seriously handicapped 
in his work. 
VI 
Having settled this very general rule, let us 
descend to more detailed consideration of 
method. The Ethnographer has in the field, 
according to what has just been said, the duty 
before him of drawing up all the rules and reg­
ularities of tribal life; all that is permanent and 
fixed; of giving an anatomy of their culture, of 
depicting the constitution of their society. But 
these things, though crystallised and set, are 
nowhere formulated. There is no written or 
explicitly expressed code of laws, and their 
whole tribal tradition, the whole structure of 
their society, are embodied in the most elusive 
of all materials; the human being. But not even 
in human mind or memory are these laws to 
be found definitely formulated. The natives 
obey the forces and commands of the tribal 
code, bu! they do not comprehend them; 
exactly as they obey their instincts and their 
impulses, but could not lay down a single law 
of psychology. The regularities in native insti­
tutions are an automatic result of the inter­
action of the mental forces of tradition, and 
of the material conditions of environment. 
Exactly as a humble member of any modern 
institution, whether it be the state, or the 
church, or the army, is of it and in it, but has 
no vision of the resulting integral action of the 
whole, still less could furnish any account of its organisation, so it would be futile to 
attempt questioning a native in abstract, soci� 
ological terms. The difference is that, in our 
society, every institution bas its intelligent 
members, its historians, and its archives and 
documents, whereas in a native society there 
are none of these. After this is realised an expe­
dient has to be found to overcome this diffi­
culty. This expedient for an Ethnographer 
consists in collecting concrete data of evidence, 
and drawing the general inferences for him­
self. This seems obvious on the face of it, but 
was not found out or at least practised in 
Ethnography till fieldwork was taken up by 
men of science. Moreover , in giving it practi­
cal effect, it is neither easy to devise the con­
crete applications of this method, nor to carry 
them out systematicaUy and consistently. 
Though we cannot ask a native about 
abstract, general rules, we can always enquire 
how a given case would be treated. Thus for 
instance, in asking how they would treat 
crime, or punish it, it would be vain to put to 
a native a sweeping question such as, "How 
do you treat and punish a criminal?" for even 
words could not be found to express it in 
native, or in pidgin. But an imaginary case, or 
still better, a real occurrence, will stimulate a 
native to express his opinion and to supply 
plentiful information. A real case indeed will 
start the natives on a wave of discussion, evoke 
expressions of indignation, show them taking 
sides -all of which talk will probably contain 
a wealth of definite views, of moral censures, 
as well as reveal the social mechanism set in 
motion by the crime committed . From there, it 
will be easy to lead them on to speak of other 
similar cases, to remember other actual occur­
rences or to discuss them in all their implica­
tions and aspects. From this material, which 
ought to cover the widest possible range of 
facts, the inference is obtained by simple 
induction. The scientific treatment differs from 
that of good common sense, first in that a 
student will extend the completeness and 
minuteness of survey much further and in 
a pedantically systematic and methodical 
manner; and secondly, in that the scientifically 
trained mind, will push the inquiry along 
really relevant lines, and towards aims pos­
sessing real importance. Indeed, the object of 

METHOD AND SCOPE OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL FIELDWORK 51 
scientific training is to provide the empirical 
investigator with a mental chart, in accordance 
with which he can take his bearings and lay 
his course. 
To return to our example, a number of 
definite cases discussed will reveal to the 
Ethnographer the social machinery for pun­
ishment. This is one part, one aspect of tribal 
authority. Imagine further that by a similar 
method of inference from definite data, he 
arrives at understanding leadership in war, in 
economic enterprise, in tribal festivities - there 
he has at once all the data necessary to answer 
the questions about tribal government and 
social authority. In actual fieldwork, the com­
parison of such data, the attempt to piece them 
together , will often reveal rifts and gaps in 
the information which lead on to further 
investigations. 
From ·my own experience, I can say that, 
very often, a problem seemed settled, every­
thing fixed and clear, till I began to write down 
a short preliminary sketch of my results. And 
�nly then, did I see the enormous deficiencies, 
which would show me where lay new prob­
lems, and lead me on to new work. In fact, I 
spent a few months between my first and 
second expeditions, and over a year between 
that and the subsequent one, in going over all 
my material, and making parts of it almost 
ready for publication each time, though each 
time I knew I would have to re-write it. Such 
cross-fer tilisation of constructive work and 
observation, I found most valuable, and I do 
not think I could have made real headway 
without it. I give this bit of my own history 
merely to show that what has been said so far 
is not only an empty programme, but the result 
of personal experience. In this volume, the 
description is given of a big institution con­
nected with ever so many associated activities, 
and presenting many aspects. To anyone who 
reflects on the subject, it will be clear that the 
information about a phenomenon of such high 
complexity and of so many ramifications, 
could not be obtained with any degree of exac­
titude and completeness, without a constant 
interplay of constructive attempts and empiri­
cal checking. In fact, I have written up an 
outline of the Kula institution at least half a 
dozen times while in the field and in the inter-vals between my expeditions. Each time, new 
problems and difficulties presented themselves. 
The collecting of concrete data over a wide 
range of facts is thus one of the main points of 
field method. The obligation is not to enumer­
ate a few examples only, but to exhaust as far 
as possible all the cases within reach; and, on 
this search for cases, the investigator will score 
most whose mental chart is clearest. But, 
whenever the material of the search allows it, 
this mental chart ought to be transformed into 
a real one; it ought to materialise into a 
diagram, a plan, an exhaustive, synoptic table 
of cases. Long since, in all tolerably good 
modern books on natives, we expect to find a 
full list or table of kinship terms, which 
includes all the data relative to it, and does not 
just pick out a few strange and anomalous 
relationships or expressions. In the investiga­
tion of kinship, the following up of one rela­
tion after another in concrete cases leads 
naturally to the construction of genealogical 
tables. Practised already by the best early 
writers, such as Munzinger, and, if I remember 
rightly, Kubary, this method has been devel­
oped to its fullest extent in the works of Dr. 
Rivers. Again, studying the concrete data of 
economic transactions, in order to trace the 
history of a valuable object, and to gauge the 
nature of its circulation, the principle of com­
pleteness and thoroughness would lead to con­
struct tables of transactions, such as we find in 
the work of Professor Seligman. It is in fol­
lowing Professor Seligman's example in this 
matter that I was able to settle certain of the 
more difficult and detailed rules of the Kula. 
The method of reducing information, if possi­
ble, into charts or synoptic tables ought to be 
extended to the study of practically all aspects 
of native life. All types of economic transac­
tions may be studied by following up con­
nected, actual cases, and putting them into a 
synoptic chart; again, a table ought to be 
drawn up of all the gifts and presents custom­
ary in a given society, a table including the 
sociological, ceremonial, and economic defini­
tion of every item. Also, systems of magic, con­
nected series of ceremonies, types of legal acts, 
all could be charted, allowing each entry to be 
synoptically defined under a number of head­
ings. Besides this, of course, the genealogical 

52 BRONISL AW MALINO WSKI 
census of every communit y, studied more in 
detail, extensive maps, plans and diagrams, 
illustrating ownership in garden land, hunting 
and fishing privileges, etc., serve as the more 
fundamental documents of ethnographic 
research. 
A genealogy is nothing else but a synoptic 
chart of a number of connected relations of 
kinship. Its value as an instrument of research 
consists in that it allows the investigator to put 
questions which he formulates to himself in 
abstracto, but can put concretely to the native 
informant. As a document, its value consists in 
that it gives a number of authenticated data, 
presented in their natural grouping. A synop­
tic chart of magic fulfils .the same function. As 
an instrument of research, I have used it in 
order to ascertain, for instance, the ideas about 
the nature of magical power. With a chart 
before me, I could easily and conveniently go 
over one item after the other, and note down 
the relevant practices and beliefs contained in 
each of them. The answer to my abstract 
problem could then be obtained by drawing a 
general inference from all the cases ... I 
cannot enter further into the discussion of 
this question, which would need further 
distinctions, such as between a chart of con­
crete, actual data, such as is a genealogy, and 
a chart summarising the outlines of a custom 
or belief, as a chart of a magical system would 
be. 
Returning once more to the question of 
methodological candour, ... I wish to point 
out here, that the procedure of concrete and 
tabularised presentation of data ought to be 
applied first to the Ethnographer's own cre­
dentials. That is, an Ethnograp her, who wishes 
to be trusted, must show clearly and concisely, 
in a tabularised · form, which are his own direct 
observations, and which the indirect informa­
tion that form the bases of his account. The 
Table will serve as an example of this proce­
dure and help the reader of this book to form 
an idea of the trustworthiness of any statement 
he is specially anxious to check. With the help 
of this Table and the many references scattered 
throughout the text, as to how, under what cir­
cumstances, and with what degree of accuracy 
I arrived at a given item of knowledge, there 
will, I hope remain no obscurity whatever as 
to the sources of the book. To summarise the first, cardinal point of 
method, I may say each phenomenon ought to 
be studied through the broadest range possible 
of its concrete manifestations; each studied by 
an exhaustive survey of detailed examples. If 
possible, the results ought to be tabulated into 
some sort of synoptic chart, both to be used as 
an instrument of study, and to be presented as 
an ethnological document. With the help of 
such documents and such study of actualities 
the clear outline of the framework of the 
natives' culture in the widest sense of the word, 
and the constitution of their society, can be 
present ed. This method could be called the 
method of statistic documentation by concrete 
evidence. 
VII 
�eedless to add, in this respect, the scientific 
fieldwork is far above even the best amateur 
productions. There is, however, one point in 
which the latter often excel. This is, in the pre­
sentation of intimate touches of native life, in 
bringing home to us these aspects of it with 
which one is made familiar only through being 
in close contact with the natives, one way or 
the other, for a long period of time. In certain 
results of scientific work -especially that 
which has been called "survey work" -we are 
given an excellent skeleton, so to spt;ak, of the 
tribal constitution, but it lacks flesh and blood. 
We learn much about the framework of their 
society, but within it, we cannot perceive or 
imagine the realities of human life, the even 
flow of everyday events, the occasional ripples 
of excitement over a feast, or ceremony, or 
some singular occurrence. In working out the 
rules and regularities of native custom, and in 
obtaining a precise formula for them from the 
collection of data and native statements, we 
find that this very precision is foreign to real 
life, which never adheres rigidly to any rules. 
It must be supplemented by the observation of 
the manner in which a given custom is carried 
out, of the behaviour of the natives in obeying 
the rules so exactly formulated by the ethnog­
rapher, of the very exceptions which in socio­
logical phenomena almost always occur. 
If all the conclusions are solely based on the 
statements of informants, or deduced from 

METHOD AND SCOPE OF ANTHROPOLOGIC AL FIELDWORK 53 
objective documents, it is of course impossible 
to supplement them in actually observed data 
of real behavio ur. And that is the reason why 
certain works of amateur residents of long 
standing, such as educated traders and 
planters, medical men and officials, and last, 
but not least, the few intelligent and unbiassed 
missionaries to whom Ethnography owes so 
much, surpass in plasticity and in vividness 
most of the purely scientific accounts. But if 
the specialised fieldworker can adopt the con­
ditions of living described above, he is in a far 
better position to be really in touch with the 
natives than any other white resident. For 
none of them lives right in a native viUage, 
except for very short periods, and everyone has 
his own business, which takes up a consider­
able part of his time. Moreover, if, like a trader 
or a missionary or an official he enters into 
active rehttions with the native, if he has to 
transform or influence or make use of him, this 
makes a real, unbiassed, impartial observation 
impossible, and precludes all-round sincerity, 
at least in the case of the missionaries and 
officials. 
Living in the village with no other business 
but to follow native Life, one sees the customs, 
ceremonies and transactions over and over 
again, one has examples of their beliefs as they 
are actually lived through, and the full body 
and blood of actual native life fills out soon 
the skeleton of abstract constructions. That is 
the reason why, working under such condi­
tions as previously described, the Ethnogra­
pher is enabled to add something essential to 
the bare outline of tribal constitution, and to 
supplement it by all the details of behaviour , 
setting and small incident. He is able in each 
case to state whether an act is public or 
private; how a public assembly behaves, and 
what it looks like; he can judge whether an 
event is ordinary or an exciting and singular 
one; whether natives bring to it a great deal of 
sincere and earnest spirit, or perform it in fun; 
whether they do it in a perfunctory manner, or 
with zeal and deliberation. 
In other words, there is a series of phenom­
ena of great importance which cannot possibly 
be recorded by questioning or computing doc­
uments, but have to be observed in their full 
actualit y. Let us call them the imponderabilia 
of actual life. Here belong such things as the routine of a man's working day, the details of 
his care of the body, of the manner of taking 
food and preparing it; the tone of conversa­
tional and social Life around the village fires, 
the existence of strong friendships or hostili­
ties, and of passing sympathies and dislikes 
between people; the subtle yet unmistakable 
manner in which personal vanities and ambi­
tions are reflected in the behaviour of the indi­
vidual and in the emotional reactions of those 
who surround him. All these facts can and 
ought to be scientifically formulated and 
recorded, but it is necessary that this be done, 
not by a superficial registration of details, a.s is 
usualJy done by untrained observers, but with 
an effort at penetrating the mental attitude 
expressed in them. And that is the reason why 
the work of scientifically trained observers, 
once seriously applied to the study of this 
aspect, will, I believe, yield results of surpass­
ing value. So far, it has been done only by ama­
teurs, and therefore done, on the whole, 
indifferently. 
Indeed, if we remember that these impon­
derable yet all important facts of actual life are 
part of the real substance of the social fabric, 
that in them are spun the innumerable threads 
which keep together the family, the clan, the 
village commun ity, the tribe-their significance 
becomes clear. The more crystallised bonds of 
social grouping, such as the definite ritual, the 
economic and legal duties, the obligations, the 
ceremonial gifts and formal marks of regard, 
though equally important for the student, are 
certainly felt less strongly by the individual 
who has to fulfil them. Applying this to our­
selves, we all know that "family life" means 
for us, first and foremost, the atmosphere of 
home, all the innumerable small acts and 
attentions in which are expressed the affection, 
the mutual interest, the little preferences, and 
the little antipathies which constitute intimacy. 
That we may inherit from this person, that we 
shall have to walk after the hearse of the other., 
though sociologically these facts belong to the 
definition of "family" and "family life," in per­
sonal perspective of what family truly is to 
us, they normally stand very much in the 
background. 
Exactly the same applies to a native com­
munity, and if the Ethnographer wants to 
bring their real life home to his readers, he 

54 BRONISL AW MALINOWSKI 
must on no account neglect this. Neither 
aspect, the intimate, as little as the legal, ought 
to be glossed over. Yet as a rule in ethno­
graphic accounts we have not both but either 
the one or the other - and, so far, the intimate 
one has hardly ever been properly treated. In 
all social relations besides the family ties, even 
those between mere tribesmen and, beyond 
that, between hostile or friendly members of 
different tribes, meeting on any sort of social 
business, there is this intimate side, expressed 
by the typical details of intercourse, the tone 
of their behaviour in the presence of one 
another. This side is different from the definite, 
crystallised legal frame of the relationship, 
and it has to be studied and stated in its own 
right. 
In the same way, in studying the conspicu­
ous acts of tribal life, such as ceremonies, rites, 
festivities, etc., the details and tone of behav­
iour ought to be given, besides the bare outline 
of events. The importance of this may be 
exemplified by one instance. Much has been 
said and written about survival. Yet the sur­
vival character of an act is expressed in 
nothing so well as in the concomitant behav­
iour, in the way in which it is carried out. Take 
any example from our own culture, whether it 
be the pomp and pageantry of a state cere­
mony, or a picturesque custom kept up by 
street urchins, its "outline" will not tell you 
whether the rite flourishes still with full vigour 
in the hearts of those who perform it or assist 
at the performance or whether they regard it 
as almost a dead thing, kept alive for tradi­
tion's sake. But observe and fix the data of 
their behaviour , and at once the degree of vital­
ity of the act will become clear. There is no 
doubt, from all points of sociological, or psy­
chological analysis, and in any question of 
theory, the manner and type of behaviour 
observed in the performance of an act is of the 
highest importance. Indeed behaviour is a fact, 
a relevant fact, and one that can be recor ded. 
And foolish indeed and short-sighted would be 
the man of science who would pass. by a whole 
class of phenomena, ready to be garnered, and 
leave them to waste, even though he did not 
see at the moment to what theoretical use they 
might be put! 
As to the actual method of observing and 
recording in fieldwork these imponderabilia of 
actual life and of typical behaviour, there is no doubt that the personal equation of the 
observer comes in here more prominently, than 
in the collection of crystaJlised, ethnographic 
data. But here also the main endeavour must 
be to let facts speak for themselves. If in 
making a daily round of the village, certain 
small incidents, characteristic forms of taking 
food, of conversing, of doing work are found 
occurring over and over again, they should be 
noted down at once. It is also important that 
this work of collecting and fixing impressions 
should begin early in the course of working 
out a district. 
Because certain subtle peculiarities, which 
make an impression as long as they are novel, 
cease to be noticed as soon as they become 
familiar. Others again can only be perceived 
with a better knowledge of the local condi­
tions. An ethnographic diary, carried on sys-
. tematically throughout the course of one's 
work in a district would be the ideal instru­
ment for this sort of study. And if, side by side 
with the normal and typical, the ethnographer 
carefully notes the slight, or the more pro­
nounced deviations from it, he will be able to 
indicate the two extremes within which the 
normal moves. 
In observing ceremonies or other tribal 
events ... it is necessary, not only to note 
down those occurrences and details which 
are prescribed by tradition and custom to be 
the essential course of the act� /but also the 
Ethnographer ought to record carefully and 
precisely, one after the oth er, the actions of the 
actors and of the spectators. Forgetting for a 
moment that he knows and understands the 
structure of this ceremony , the main dogmatic 
ideas underlying it, he might try to find himself 
only in the midst of an assembly of human­
beings, who behave seriously or jocularly, with 
earnest concentration or with bored frivolity, 
who are either in the same mood as he finds. 
them every day, or else are screwed up to a 
high pitch of excitement, and so on and so on. 
With his attention constantly directed to this 
aspect of tribal life, with the constant endeav­
our to fix it; to express it in terms of actual 
fact, a good deal of reliable and expressive 
material finds its way into his notes. He will 
be able to "set" the act into its proper place in 
tribal life, that is to show whether it is excep­
tional or commonplace, one in which the 
natives behave ordinar ily, or one in which their 

METHOD AND SCOPE OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL FIELDWORK 55 
whole behaviour is transformed. And he will 
also be able to bring all this home to his 
readers in a clear, convincing manner. 
Again, in this type of work, it is good for 
the Ethnographer sometimes to put aside 
camera, note book and pencil, and to join in 
himself in what is going on. He can take part 
in the natives' games, he can follow them on 
their visits and walks, sit down and listen 
and share in their conversations. I am not 
certain if this is equally easy for everyone -
perhaps the Slavonic nature is more plastic and 
more naturally savage than that of Western 
Europeans -but though the degree of success 
varies, the attempt is possible for everyone. 
Out of such plunges into the life of the natives 
-and I made them frequently not only for 
study's sake but because everyone needs 
human company -I have carried away a dis­
tinct feeling that their behaviour , their manner 
of being, in all sorts of tribal transactions, 
became more transparent and easily under­
standable than it had been before. AJl these 
methodological remarks, the reader will find 
again illustrated in the following chapters. 
VIII 
Finally, let us pass to the third and last aim of 
scientific fieldwork, to the last type of phe­
nomenon which ought to be recorded in order 
to give a full and adequate picture of native 
culture. Besides the firm outline of tribal con­
stitution and crystallised cultural items which 
form the skeleton, besides the data of daily life 
and ordinary behaviour , which are, so to 
speak, its flesh and blood, there is still to be 
recorded the spirit -the natives' views and 
opinions and utterances. For, in every act of 
tribal life, there is, first, the routine prescribed 
by custom and tradition, then there is the 
manner in which it is carried out, and lastly 
there is the commentary to it, contained in the 
natives' mind. A man who submits to various 
customary obligations, who follows a tradi­
tional course of action, does it impelled by 
certain motives, to the accompaniment of 
certain feelings, guided by certain ideas. These 
ideas, feelings, and impulses are moulded and 
conditioned by the culture in which we find 
them, and are therefore an ethnic peculiarity 
of the given society. An attempt must be made therefore, to study and record them. 
But is this possible? Are these subjective 
states not too elusive and shapeless? And, even 
granted that people usually do feel or think or 
experience certain psychological states in asso­
ciation with the performance of customary 
acts, the majority of them surely are not able 
to formulate these states, to put them into 
words. This latter point must certainly be 
granted, and it is perhaps the real Gordian 
knot in the study of the facts of social psy­
chology. Without trying to cut or untie this 
knot, that is to solve the problem theoretically, 
or to enter further into the field of general 
methodolog y, I shall make directly for the 
question of practical means to overcome some 
of the difficulties involved. 
First of all, it has to be laid down that we 
have to study here stereotyped manners of 
thinking and feeling. As sociologists, we are 
not interested in what A or B may feel qua 
individuals, in .the accidental course of their 
own personal experiences -we are interested 
only in what they feel and think qua members 
of a given community. Now in this capacity, 
their mental states receive a certain stamp, 
become stereotyped by the institutions in 
which they live, by the influence of tradition 
and folk-lore, by the very vehicle of thought, 
that is by language. The social and cultural 
environment in which they move forces them 
to think and feel in a definite manner. Thus, a 
man who lives in a polyandrous community 
cannot experience the same feelings of jeal­
ousy, as a strict monogynist, though he might 
have the elements of them. A man who lives 
within the sphere of the Kula cannot become 
permanently and sentimentally attached to 
certain of his possessions, in spite of the fact 
that he values them most of all. These exam­
ples are crude, but better ones will be found in 
the text of this book. 
So, the third commandment of fieldwork 
runs: Find out the typical ways of thinking and 
feeling, corresponding to the institutions and 
culture of a given commun ity, and formulate 
the results in the most convincing manner. 
What will be the method of procedure? The 
best ethnographical writers -here again the 
Cambridge school with Haddon, Rivers, 
and Seligman rank first among English 
Ethnographers -have always tried to quote 
verbatim statements of .crucial importance. 

56 BRONISLAW MALINOWSKI 
They also adduce terms of native classification; 
sociological, psychological and industrial 
termini technici, and have rendered the verbal 
contour of native thought as precisely as pos­
sible. One step further in this line can be made 
by the Ethnograp her, who acquires a knowl­
edge of the native language and can use it as 
an instrument of inquiry. In working in the 
Kiriwinian language, 1 found still some diffi­
culty in writing down the statement directly in 
translation which at first I used to do in the act 
of taking notes. The translation often robbed 
the text of all its significant characteristics -
rubbed off all its points -so that gradually I 
was led to note down cenain important 
phrases just as they were spoken, in the native 
tongue. As my knowledge of the language 
progressed, I put down more and more in 
Kiriwinian, till at last I found myself writing 
exclusively in that language, rapidly taking 
notes, word for word, of each statement. No 
sooner had I arrived at this point, than I recog­
nised that I was thus acquiring at the same 
time an abundant linguistic material, and a 
series of ethnographic documents which ought 
to be reproduced as I had fixed them, besides 
being utilised in the writing up of my account. 4 
This corpus inscriptionum Kiriwiniensium 
can be utilised, not only by myself, but by all 
those who, through their better penetration 
and ability of interpreting them, may find 
points which escape my attention, very much 
as the other corpora form the basis for the 
various interpretations of ancient and prehis­
toric cultures; only, these ethnographic inscrip­
tions are all deciphera ble and clear, have been 
almost all translated fully and unambiguously , 
and have been provided with native cross­
commentaries or scholia obtained from living 
sources. 
No more need be said on this subject here, 
... The Corpus will of course be published 
separately at a later date. 
IX 
Our considerations thus indicate that the goal 
of ethnographic fieldwork must be approached 
through three avenues: 1 The organisation of the tribe, and the 
anatomy of its culture must be recorded in 
firm, clear outline. The method of concrete, 
statistical documentation is the means through 
which such an outline has to be given. 
2 Within this frame, the imponderabilia of 
actual life, and the type of behaviour have to 
be filled in. They have to be collected through 
minute, detailed observations, in the form of 
some son of ethnographic diary, made possi­
ble by close contact with native life. 
3 A collection of ethnographic statements, 
characteristic narratives, typical utterances, 
items of folk-lore and magical formulre has to 
be given as a corpus inscriptionum, as docu­
ments of native mentality. 
These three lines of approach lead to the 
final goal, of which an Ethnographer should 
never lose sight. This goal is, briefly, to grasp 
the native's point of view, his relation to life, 
to realise his vision of his world. We have to 
study man, and we must study what concerns 
him most intimately, that is, the hold which life 
has on him. In each culture, the values are 
slightly different; people aspire after different 
aims, follow different impulses, yearn after a 
different form of happiness. In each culture, 
we find different institutions in which man 
pursues his life-interest, different customs by 
which he satisfies his aspirations, different 
codes of law and morality which reward his 
virtues or punish his defectio�s. To study the 
institutions, customs, and codes or to study the 
behaviour and mentality without the subjec­
tive desire of feeling by what these people live, 
of realising the substance of their happiness -
is, in my opinion, to miss the greatest reward 
which we can hope to obtain from the study 
of man. 
These generalities the reader will find illus­
trated in the following chapters. We shall see 
there the savage striving to satisfy certain aspi­
rations, to attain his type of value, to follow 
his line of social ambition. We shall see him 
led on to perilous and difficult enterprises by 
a tradition of magical and heroical exploits, 
shall see him following the lure of his own 
romance. Perhaps as we read the account of 
these remote customs there may emerge a 
feeling of solidarity with the endeavours and 
ambitions of these natives. Perhaps man's men-

METHOD AND SCOPE OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL FIELDWORK 57 
tality will be revealed to us, and brought near, 
along some lines which we never have fol­
lowed before. Perhaps through realising 
human nature in a shape very distant and 
foreign to us, we shall have some light shed on our own. In this, and in this case only, we shall 
be justified in feeling that it has been worth our 
while to understand these natives, their insti­
tutions and customs, and that we have gath­
ered some profit from the Kula. 

Part II 
Fieldwor k Identity 
Antonius C. G. M. Robben 
Bronislaw Malinowski was sensitive to the social life on Kiriwina Island but he did 
not critically examine his own role and feelings to the Trobrianders, even though 
his loneliness filters through the opening sentence of the excerpt from his "Method 
and Scope of Anthropological Fieldwork" (Chapter 3). He had written an intimate 
diary about his problems and depressions, and his chagrin at the local population, 
but these revelations only became available after his death (Malinowski 1967). His 
student Hortense Powdermaker was among the first to openJy reveal the personal 
hardships, role conflicts, and identity crises of fieldworkers. Laura Bohannan had 
preceded Powdermaker with Return to Laughter (Chapter 36) by more than a 
decade, but she had published under a pseudonym and written in a popularizing 
style. Bohannan and Powdermaker initiated a trend of self-reflection on the prac­
tice of fieldwork that became more prominent in anthropology than in any other 
scholarly discipline. The lengthy immersion in foreign cultures, the status of ethno­
graphers as outsiders, the interactive anthropological research methods in general 
and participant observation in particular , and the nature of fieldwork as a profes­
sional rite of passage with often far-reaching effects on the self, made the concern 
for identity during fieldwork of great and enduring importance from the 1960s 
onward. 
Hortense Powdermaker carried out her first fieldwork in 1929-30 among the Lesu 
on the island of New Ireland in Melanesia. In the excerpt" A Woman Going Native," 
taken from her book Stranger and Friend: The Way of an Anthropologist (1967), 
Powdermaker demonstrates how her gender and ethnic status influenced her 
research. Melanesian societies enforce a rather strict division between men and 
women into different social domains, and therefore she drifts naturally to those roles 
which women occupy in Lesu society: working in the taro gardens, preparing food, 
carrying and delivering babies, and dancing at women's feasts. Her research among 
men carries more restrictions because of her female status. It consists mostly of ethno­
graphic interviews, even though she participates in fishing, feasts, and mortuary 
rituals whenever invited. Fortunately, Powdermaker is not fully categorized 
as a woman by the Lesu and is therefore able to cross gender boundaries with 
relative ease. Still, this gender neutrality has the cost of not being confided in by 
either men or women. Only after she throws herself fully into a dance during the 

60 PART 11: FIELDWORK IDENTITY 
incorporation ritual of boys who had been initiated into manhood does Powder­
maker become accepted by the women, and is, for the duration of the ceremony, 
treated by men with the same symbolic gender hostility as Lesu women. Such treat­
ment, however benign, cannot but raise the awareness of anthropologists about the 
impact of gender on their data collection and research results. Powdermaker con­
cludes that female anthropologists seem to have easier access to both sexes than male 
anthropologists, whose contact with women is often regarded by men as threaten­
ing. Yet, Gregory (1984) has argued the contrary, while Golde (1986) has pointed 
out that once a woman has been accepted into a society, she is expected to conform 
to the prevailing gender roles and has less freedom to move around at will than men 
in comparable situations {see Wolf 1996 for a feminist critique of fieldwork). 
After completing her research among the Lesu, Hortense Powdermaker returned 
to the United States and conducted fieldwork on African Americans in Mississippi 
between 1932 and 1934. She traced this interest to her student days when she rode 
a crowded streetcar on a blistering hot day in Baltimore. A white woman com­
plained to her about the foul air around the sweaty African American workers. Pow­
dermaker noticed the same odor, took a few steps towards the white workers, 
discovered that they smelled just as much of perspiration, and finally realized that 
in fact she herself reeked equally bad, after spending the day working on her summer 
job at the playground (Powdermaker _1967:132). This anecdote reveals Powder­
maker's anthropological intuition, even before her formal training: she noticed a 
racial remark, tested its validity, ascertained it to be unfounded, and then reflected 
on her similar personal state. 
Powdermaker concealed her Jewish identity in the Mississippi Bible Belt com­
munity and tried to establish a good rapport with black and white. This was a time 
of strong Southern racial segregation, when lynchings of African Americans were 
common and the Ku Klux Klan was strong. Understanda bly, Powdermaker had to 
walk a fine line between the white and black neighborhoods in the town she called 
Indianola. Her confrontation with the exploitation of African American fellow­
citizens, the racism of the white inhabitants, and the fear between both groups, made 
her conscious of her own status as a white Jewish woman in a segregated Ameri­
can society. She also began to doubt whether she would have behaved differently 
toward African Americans had she been born in Indianola, hemmed in by social 
taboos and racial stereotypes. She became insecure about her own identity as she 
shuttled back and forth between blacks and whites, adopting as if through osmosis 
some of the qualities of each group. Just as she had straddled the gender gap 
among_ the Lesu, she crossed the color barrier as if belonging to both segregated 
communities. 
Powdermaker went through another serious crisis when a lynching party set out 
to hunt down an African American accused of raping a white woman. Feeling pow­
erless, she decided to retreat into her role as the neutral observer trying to make 
sense of her fellow-citizens' behavior. This distancing must have been a form of self­
protection against the racial discrimination and blatant social disparity she was 
seeing in her country. Her ethnographic initiation on New Ireland allowed her to 
cope with her ambiguous social role in Mississippi, distance herself by assuming a 
professional attitude, and overcome her depressions, fears, and anxieties. 
Powdermaker's slow entry and acceptance into female Lesu society and less than 
full participation in a strongly segregated Indianola have the characteristics of a rite 

INTRODUCTION 61 
of passage. Arnold van Gennep has argued that "The life of an individual in any 
society is a series of passages from one age to another and from one occupation to 
another" (1960:2-3). Norris Brock johnson (1984), in his article "Sex, Color, and 
Rites of Passage in Ethnographic Research," demonstrates that field workers 
undergo a similar transition. They bid farewell to their country or city, reappear as 
strangers in their host society or communit y, and pass a period of time in limbo as 
they await acceptance. They learn local social rules and cultural practices, become 
eager apprentices, and will finally be incorporated as full, albeit temporary residents. 
Johnson draws special attention to the influence of the ethnographer's identity, in 
terms of skin color and gender, on the form, degree, and length of the liminal period 
between arrival and admission. 
Johnson traveled to the Caribbean island of Bequia as a young, single, bearded 
African American man interested in studying traditional boatmaking. The recent 
Marxist revolution on nearby Grenada and the political turmoil on Bequia raised 
suspicions about him being a revolutionary. People kept their distance and it took 
nearly a week before he was able to meet two highly esteemed shipwrights. His pol­
itics were now perhaps beyond question, but what about his gender identity? Was 
he rea�ly up to the local standards of a "real man" who was worthy of respect, 
knowledgeable about boatmaking, skillful with his hands, and competent at sea? 
Johnson passed the test as he sailed a small boat across the bay of Bequia, turning 
himself from an outsider into an apprentice boatbuilde r. It is crucial to realize that 
this passage reveals something about the .fieldworker's various social identities and 
indicates that acceptance translates into privileged knowledge and a respecta ble 
social status that otherwise would not have been forthcoming. Johnson also shared 
in the banter about women and sex, thus revealing another aspect of Bequian male 
identity as well as showing its clear gender divisions. In other words, the success­
ful passage and incorporation into the professional world of respected shipwrights 
had a direct effect on the quality of his fieldwork and revealed crucial aspects of 
Bequian society. 
Johnson' s identity as a black American helped his admission to the world of black 
Caribbean shipwrights but had hindered his previous fieldwork in a primary public 
school in the American Midwest (see Sudarkasa 1986 for comparable experiences 
of an African American woman in Africa). Just as in Bequia, he had difficulty enter­
ing this small social universe, encountering strong spatial and social divisions 
between men and women, and a prominent gender stratification among teachers 
and administration. Johnson' s male status raised such suspicion and social distanc­
ing from the female teachers that it took several months before he earned their trust. 
He accomplished this by showing them his respect, displaying his teaching skills and 
knowledge about school affairs, avoiding male company and, unlike the male staff, 
showing a proper sexual restraint toward the women. He became incorporated into 
the school community, even though his contacts were closer with black than with 
white female teachers. Clearly, skin color and gender roles may be so prescriptive 
of social interaction in many complex societies that they influence the reception of 
ethnographers, and limit their access to particular social groups and their knowl­
edge. Competence helps to bridge some gaps, while a genuine affinity with and affec­
tion for a culture will open other doors. 
Powdermaker and Johnson demonstrated the influence of gender and ethnicity 
on fieldwork but did not discuss the importance of sexuality. Anthropologists have 

62 PART 11: FIELDWORK IDENTITY 
shown a keen interest in the sex lives of other societies, but they have failed to 
examine their own erotic subjectivity. Kulick (1995) attributes this neglect to anthro­
pology's objectivist approach to the study of culture and its rejection of personal 
narratives, at least till the postmodern turn of the 1970s. Furthermore, sexuality 
continues to be a taboo subject in Western culture while the male heterosexual 
anthropological community has concealed the sexist, racist, and colonialist biases 
hiding behind much anthropological discourse about sexualit y, argues Kulick. 
Manda Cesara (1982) was the first anthropologist to address at length her sexual 
feelings and affairs in the field, albeit under a pseudonym. Several collections on 
fieldwork and sexuality have appeared since then, especially by gay and lesbian 
anthropologists (e.g., Kulick and Willson 1995, Lewin and Leap 1996). The issue 
of sexual identity is of particular relevance to them as members of a group stigma­
tized in almost every society. The question of whether homosexual anthropologists 
should reveal their sexual identity in a largely heterosexual world is a matter of 
debate. Conce�lment versus openness is of a different relevance when studying 
neutral or homosexual topics, but the relative advantages of either strategy are 
highly dependent on the host culture, as some may be hostile while others will be 
indifferent or sympathetic to the forthright fieldworker. 
Ethical concerns about the inequality of intimate relations in the field have made 
teachers urge students to refrain from sexual engagements with research collabora­
tors. Aside from the fact that such sexual encounters will nevertheless take place, a 
far more interesting issue is to what extent the fieldworker's erotic subjectivity enters 
into the gathering and interpretation of research data. Many anthropologists may 
not act on their sexual desires in the field, but the presence and even interference 
of erotic feelings and fantasies during fieldwork is beyond question. Do these emo­
tions undermine the gathering of data and take away the fieldworker's critical objec­
tivity, or do they instead enrich the fieldwork experience and open new .cultural 
interpretat ions? Kate Altork (1995) addresses these issues in the selection "Walking 
the Fire Line: The Erotic Dimension of the Fieldwork Experience." 
Altork conducted fieldwork among 1,100 male and about 30 female firefighters 
living in a temporary base camp in the forests of Idaho. The overwhelming expan­
siveness of the natural environment and the danger of forest fires increased Altork's 
sensory perception and stimulated her sexual and emotional passions. These erotic 
feelings were not simply aroused by her physical attraction to the male firefighters 
and the seduction of their innuendoes, gazes, and flirtations, but especially by the 
human bonding and camaraderie within an isolated community built around the 
commori mission of fighting forest fires. Altork advocates a fieldwork approach that 
gives due attention to the sensual and sexual as well as the intellectual and analytic 
dimensions of fieldwork because the two are inextricably linked in the human con­
dition. Such complete immersion in a field setting, and a conscious awareness of 
emotional and erotic attachments during fieldwork, will heighten the senses and 
contribute significantly to a deeper emotional understanding and more comprehen­
sive rendition of the people under study and, ultimately, of the fieldworker's self. 
Anthony P. Co\len (1992) takes these reflections about social roles and identities 
one step further in the article ''Self-Conscious Anthropology " by examining the 
ethnographer's self inside and outside the field, and his or her intersubjective rela­
tion with research participants. There is a paradox here in the understanding of the 
fieldworker's self and that of others: whereas ethnographers tend to give more

importance to what a community thinks about its members than what the members 
think about themselves, fieldworkers rely more on their self-knowledge through par­
ticipant observation as a source of cultural understanding than on the communit y's 
views of them {see Basso 1979, Okely and Callaway 1992, and Reed-Danahay 1997 
for notable exception s). Fieldworkers have a tendency to regard people as rather 
indistinct bearers of culture. They are overwhelmed by the ethnographic task at 
hand, the time constraints on their research period, and the impossibility to know 
all members in depth and fully account for their uniqueness. Furthermore, they have 
been trained in an epistemological tradition that privileges the social over the per­
sonal. In other words, anthropol ogists often see people as society-driven rather than 
self-driven, and more in terms of personhood than of selfhood. Instead, Cohen pro­
poses to acknowledge the intrinsic complexity of the self, to recognize the self's cre­
ative agency, and to examine local concepts of selfhood (see Cohen 1994 for a 
theoretical development of the concept of self; also Battaglia 1995). 
Empathy plays a crucial role in this research agenda because, like everybody else, 
fieldworkers understand themselves by mentally observing their own social position 
and selfhood through the perspectives of others. At the same time, Cohen empha­
sizes that there are discrepancies between how we see ourselves (and by implication 
how others whom we study see themselves ), how others see us, and how we imagine 
others see us. Cohen questions the opinion of cultural-relativist anthropologists who 
regard "the self" as a Western cultural construct. He argues that other cultures may 
. have different notions of selfhood but that everywhere the self has an inner state, 
a certain degree of autonomy with an internal dialogue, and a personal sense of 
time and space. 
What these four contributions show is that fieldwork is not a detached activity 
carried out by an objective observer but that subjective experiences and selfhood 
are part and parcel of fieldwork and its results. The ethnographer's multiple social 
identities and his or her dynamic self may be liabilities but also research assets. 
Anthropologists may use their gender, sexual orientation, skin color, physical skills, 
nationality, age, marital status, parenthood, and self to obtain data that are un­
available to those with different personal assets (see Okely and Callaway 1992; 
Whitehead and Conaway 1986). Fieldwork involves a negotiation between 
ethnographers and research collaborators into which each of their unique constitu­
tions enters.
