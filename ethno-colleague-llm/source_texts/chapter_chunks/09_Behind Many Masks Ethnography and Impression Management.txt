Behind Many Masks: 
Ethnography and Impression 
Management 
Gerald D. Berreman 
Ethnographers have all too rarely made 
explicit the methods by which the information 
reported in their descriptive and analytical 
works was derived. Even less frequently have 
they attempted systematic descriptions of 
those aspects of the field experience which fall 
outside of a conventional definition of method, 
but which are crucial to the research and its 
results. The potential fieldworker in any given 
area often has to rely for advance information 
about many of the practical problems of his 
craft upon the occasional verbal anecdotes 
of his predecessors or the equally random 
remarks included in ethnographic prefaces. To 
the person facing fieldwork for the first time, 
the dearth of such information may appear to 
be the result of a conviction, among those who 
know, that experience can be the only teacher. 
Alternatively, he may suspect ethnographers of 
having established a conspiracy of silence on 
these matters. When he himself becomes a 
bona fide ethnographer he may join that con­
spiracy inadvertently, or he may feel obligated 
to join it not only to protect the secrets of 
ethnography, but to protect himself. As a result 
of the rules of the game which kept others 
from communicating their experience to him, he may feel that his own difficulties of morale 
and rapport, his own compromises between 
the ideal and the necessary, were unique, and 
perhaps signs of weakness or incompetence. 
Consequently, these are concealed or mini­
mized. More acceptable aspects of the field 
experience such as those relating to formal 
research methods, health hazards, transporta­
tion facilities and useful equipment suffice to 
answer the queries of the curious. This is in 
large measure a matter of maintaining the 
proper "front" (see below) before an audience 
made up not only of the uninitiated, but in 
many cases of other ethnographers as well. 
As a result of this pattern "Elenore Bowen'' 
shared the plight of many an anthropological 
neophyte when, according to her fictionalized 
account she arrived in West Africa girded for 
fieldwork with her professors' formulae for 
success: 
Always walk in cheap tennis shoes; the water 
runs out more quickly, [and] You'll need more 
tables than you think. (Bowen, 1954, pp. 3-4)

usual sense. It is a description of some aspects 
of my field research, analyzed from a particu­
lar point of view. As such, it is an attempt to 
portray some features of that human experi­
ence which is fieldwork, and some of the im­
plications of its being human experience for 
ethnography as a scientific endeavor. It is not 
intended as a model for others to follow. It tells 
what happened, what I did, why I did it and 
with wha:t apparent effect. As in all fieldwork, 
the choices were not always mine and the 
results were frequently unanticipated. But the 
choices and results have proved instructive. I 
hope that this account will add depth to the 
ethnographic study which follows by convey­
ing the methods and circumstances which led 
to it. 
Introduction 
Every ethnographe r, when he reaches the field, 
is faced immediately with accounting for 
himself before the people he proposes to learn 
to know. Only when this has been accom­
plished can he proceed to his avowed task 
of seeking to understand and interpret the way 
of life of those people. The second of these 
endeavors is more frequently discussed in 
anthropological literature than the first, 
although the success of the enterprise depends 
as largely upon one as the other. Both tasks, in 
common with all social interaction, involve the 
control and interpretation of impressions, in 
this case those conveyed by the ethnographer 
and his subjects to one another . Impressions 
are derived from a complex of observations 
and inferences drawn &om what people do as 
well as what they say both in public, i.e., when 
they know they are being �atched, and in 
private, i.e., when they think they are not being 
watched. Attempts to convey a desired impres­
sion of one's self and to interpret accurately the 
behavior and attitudes of others are an inher­
ent part of any social interaction, and they are 
crucial to ethnographic research. 
My research in a tightly closed and highly 
stratified society can serve as a case study from 
which to analyze some of the problems and 
consequences inherent in the interaction of 
ethnographer and subjects. Special emphasis 
wi11 be placed upon the differential effects of the ethnographer's identification with high­
status and low-status groups in the community. 
The Setting 
The research upon which this account is based 
took place in and around Sirkanda, a peasant 
village of the lower Himalayas of North India. 
Its residents, like those of the entire lower 
Himalayan area from Kashmir through Nepal, 
are known as Paharis (of the mountains). The 
village is small, containing some 384 individ­
uals during the year of my residence there in 
1957-8, and it is relatively isolated, situated as 
it is in rugged hills accessible only on foot and 
nine miles from the nearest road and bus 
serv1ce. 
Strangers in the area are few and readily iden­
tifiable by dress and speech. People who are so 
identified are avoided or discouraged from 
remaining long in the vicinity. To escape such 
a reception, a person must be able to identify 
himself as a member of a familiar group 
through kinship ties, caste (iati) ties and/or 
community affiliation. Since the first two are 
ascribed characteristics, the only hope an 
outsider has of achieving acceptance is by 
establishing residence and, through social 
interaction, acquiring the status of a commu­
nity-dweller; a slow process at 6est. 
The reluctance of Sirkanda villagers and 
their neighbors to accept strangers is attested 
to by the experience of those outsiders who 
have dealt with them. In 1957 a new teacher 
was assigned to the Sirkanda school. He was 
a Pahari from an area some fifty miles distant. 
Despite his Pahari background and consequent 
familiarity with the language and customs of 
the local people, he complained after four 
months in the village that his reception had 
been less than cordial: 
I have taught in several schools in the valley 
and people have always been friendly to me. 
They have invited me to their homes for 
meals, have sent gifts of grain and vegetables 
with their children, and have tried to make me 
feel at home. I have been here four months 
now with almost no social contact aside from 
my students. No one has asked me to eat with 

ETHNO-GRAPHY AND IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT 139 
him; no one has sent me so much as a grain 
of millet; no one has asked me to sit and talk 
with him; no one has even asked me who I am 
or whether I have a family. They ignore me. 
He fared better than the teacher in another 
vilJage of the area who had to give up after 
three months during which he and his pro­
posed school were totally boycotted. 
Among the forestry officers whose duty it is 
to make periodic rounds in these hills, vil­
lagers' lack of hospitality is proverbial. They 
claim that here a man has to carry his own 
food, water, and bedroll because he cannot 
count on villagers to offer these necessities to 
him on his travels. Community development 
and establishment of credit cooperatives, two 
governmental programs in the area, have been 
unsuccessful largely because of their advo­
cates' 'inability to establish rapport with the 
people. My assistant, who had worked for 
more than a year in an anthropological 
research project in a village of the plains, was 
constantly baffled at the reticence and lack of 
hospitality of villagers. As he said: 
In Kalapur, when you walked through the 
village, men would hail you and invite you to 
sit and talk with them. Whether or not they 
really wanted you to do so, they at least 
invited you out of common courtesy. Here 
they just go inside or turn their backs when 
they see you coming. 
The reasons for such reticence are not far 
to seek. Contacts with outsiders have been 
limited largely to contacts with policemen and 
tax collectors -two of the lowest forms of life 
in the Pahari taxonomy. Such officials are 
despised and feared not only because they 
make trouble for villagers in the line of duty, 
but because they also extort bribes on the 
threat of causing further trouble and often 
seem to take advantage of their official posi­
tions to vent their aggressions on these vul­
nerable people. Since India's independence, 
spheres of governmental responsibility have 
extended to include stringent supervision of 
greatly extended national forest lands, 
rationing of certain goods, establishment of a 
variety of development programs, etc. The 
grounds for interfering in village affairs have multiplied as the variety of officials has prolif­
erated. Any stranger , therefore, may be a gov­
ernment agent, and as such he is potentially 
troublesome and even dangerous. 
Villagers' fears on this score are not ground­
less. Aside from the unjust exploitation which 
such agents are reputed to employ in their 
activities, there are many illegal or semilegal 
activities carried on by villagers which could 
be grounds for punishment and are easily used 
as grounds for extortion. In Sirkanda, national 
forest lands and products have been illegally 
appropriated by villagers, taxable land has 
been underreponed, liquor is brewed and sold 
illicitly, women have been illegally sold, guns 
have gone unlicensed, adulterated milk is 
sold to outside merchants, children are often 
married below the legal age, men have fled the 
army or escaped from jail, property has been 
illegally acquired from fleeing Muslims at the 
time of partition. Any of these and similar real 
and imagined infractions may be objects of a 
stranger's curiosity and therefore are reasons 
for discouraging his presence in the village. 
Paharis are thought by people of the plains 
to be ritually, spiritually, and morally inferior. 
They are suspected of witchcraft and evil 
magic. In addition they are considered naive 
bumpkins -the hillbilly stereotype of other 
cultures. Paharis try to avoid interaction with 
those who hold these stereotypes. Alien 
Brahmins may seek to discredit their Pahari 
counterparts by finding evidence of their 
unorthodoxy; alien traders may seek to relieve 
them of their hard-earned cash or produce by 
sharp business practices; scoundrels may seek 
to waylay or abduct village women; thieves 
may come to steal their worldly possessions; 
lawyers or their cohorts may seek evidence for 
trumped-up legal proceedings which a poor 
Pahari could not hope to counteract in court; 
Christian missionaries may hope to infringe on 
their religious beliefs and practices. Strangers 
are therefore suspected of having ulterior 
motives even if they are not associated with the 
government. 
The only way to feel sure that such dangers 
do not inhere in a person is to know who he 
is, and to know this he must fit somewhere into 
the known social system. Only then is he 
subject to effective local controls so that if 
he transgresses, or betrays a trust, he can be 

140 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
brought to account. The person who is beyond 
control is beyond trust and is best hurried on 
his way. This is, therefore, a relatively closed 
s.ociety. Interaction with strangers is kept to 
a minimum; the information furnished them 
is scanty and stereotyped. Access to such a 
society is difficult for an outsider. 
Within this closed society there is rigid strati­
fication into a number of hereditary, ranked, 
endogamous groups -castes -comprising two 
large divisions: the high or twice-born castes 
and the low or untouchable castes. The high 
castes, Rajputs and Brahmins, are land-owning 
agriculturalists who are dominant in numbers, 
comprising ninety per cent of the population. 
They are dominant in economic wherewithal, 
in that they own most of the land and animals, 
while the other castes depend on them for their 
livelihood. They are dominant in political 
power, for both traditional and new official 
means of control are in their hands. They dom- · 
inate in ritual status as twice-born, ritually 
clean castes while all other castes are untouch­
able (achut). In most villages, as in Sirkanda, 
Rajputs oumumber Brahmins and so are 
locally dominant, but the ritual and social dis­
tance between them is not great and the eco­
nomic difference is usually nil (Srinivas, 1959). 
The low castes, whose members are artisans, 
are disadvantaged in each respect that the high 
castes are advantaged. They are dependent 
upon the high castes for their livelihood and 
are subject to the will of the high castes in 
almost every way. Ideally their relationship to 
the high castes is one of respect, deference, and � 
obedience. In return high-caste members are 
supposed to be paternalistic. In practice there 
is a good deal of tension in the relationship, 
and it is held stable largely by considerations 
of relative power (Berreman, 1960a). 
In addition there are nonhierarchical cleav­
ages within the high castes and within the low 
castes based upon kinship ties (lineage and sib 
lines being paramount) and informal cliques 
and factions. As a result of these factors the 
community is divided within itself. While there 
is consensus on some things, there is disagree­
ment on others. Acceptance by one element of 
the community does not imply acceptance by 
the whole community and it frequently, in fact, 
precludes it. The Research 
It was into this community that my interpreter­
assistant and I walked, unannounced, one 
rainy day in Septembe r, 1957, hoping to 
engage in ethnographic research. On our initial 
visit we asked only to camp there while we 
visited a number of surrounding villages. We 
were introduced by a note from a non-Pahari 
wholesaler of the nearest market town who 
had long bought the surplus agricultural 
produce of villagers and had, as it turned out, 
through sharp practices of an obscure nature, 
acquired land in the village. He asked that the 
villagers treat the strangers as "our people" 
and extend all hospitality to them. As might 
have been expected, our benefactor was not 
beloved in the village and it was more in spite 
of his intercession than on account of it that 
we ultimately managed to do a year's research 
in the village. 
The note was addressed to a high-caste man 
who proved to be one of the most suspicious 
people of the village; the head of a household 
recently victorious in a nine-year court battle 
over land brought against the household by 
virtually the entire village; the leader of a 
much-resented but powerful minority faction. 
That he gave us an unenthusiastic reception 
was a blow to our morale but probably a boon 
to our chances of being tolerated jn the village. 
The interpreter-assistant who accompanied me 
was a young Brahmin of plains origin who had 
previously worked in a similar capacity for a 
large research project carried out in the plains 
village of Kala pur. I shall hereafter refer to him 
as Sharma. 
For the first three months of our stay in the 
village, most of our time was spent keeping 
house and attempting to establish rapport, 
both of which were carried out under trying 
circumstances. 
According to their later reports to us, vil­
lagers at first assumed that we were mission­
aries, a species which had not previously 
invaded this locality but which was well 
known. Several villagers had sold milk in Mus­
soorie, a hill station sixteen miles distant that 
is frequented by missionaries. When we failed 
to meddle in religious matters or to show sur-

ETHNOGRAPHY AND IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT 141 
prise at local rituals, this suspicion gradually 
faded. We had anticipated this interpretation 
of our motives and so were careful not to show 
undue interest in religion as a topic of conver­
sation. We purposely used Hindu rather than 
areligious forms of greeting in our initial con­
tacts to avoid being identified as missionaries. 
As a topic for polite and, we hoped, neutral 
conversation, we chose agriculture. It seemed 
timely too, as the fall harvest season began not 
long after our arrival in the village. Partly as a 
result of this choice of conversational fare, sus­
picion arose that we were government agents 
sent to reassess the land tor taxation purposes, 
based on the greater-than-previously-reported 
productivity of the land. Alternatively, we 
were suspected of being investigators seeking 
to find the extent of land use in unauthorized 
areas following the nationalization of the 
surrounding uncultivated lands. My physical 
appearance was little comfort to villagers har­
boring these suspicions. One man commented 
that "Anyone can look like a foreigner if he 
wears the right clothes." Gradually these fears 
too disappeared, but others arose. 
One person suggested that our genealogical 
inquiries might be preliminary to a military 
draft of the young men. The most steadfast 
opponent of our presence hinted darkly at the 
machin ations of foreign spies - a vaguely 
understood but actively feared type of villain. 
Nearly four months had passed before overt 
suspicion of this sort was substantially dissi­
pated, although, of course, some people had 
been convinced of the innocence of our 
motives relatively early and others remained 
suspicious throughout our stay. 
One incident nearly four months after our 
first visit to the village proved to be a turning 
point in quelling overt opposition to our 
activities in the village. We were talking one 
afternoon to the local Brahmin priest. He had 
proved to be a reluctant informant, apparently 
because of his fear of alienating powerful and 
suspicious Rajputs whose caste-fellows out­
numbered his own by more than thirty to one 
in the village (his was the only Brahmin house­
hold as compared to 37 Rajput households in 
Sirkanda), and in whose good graces it was 
necessary for him· to remain for many reasons. 
However, he was basically friendly. Encour­
aged by our increasing rapport in the village at large, by his own feelings of affinity with my 
Brahmin assistant, Sharma, and by the privacy 
of his secluded threshing platform as a talking 
place, he had volunteered to discuss his family 
tree with us. Midway in our discussion, one of 
the most influential and hostile of the Rajputs 
came upon us -probably intentionally -and 
sat down with us. The Brahmin immediately 
became self-conscious and uncommunicative 
but it was too late to conceal the topic of our 
conversation. The Rajput soon interrupted, 
asking why the Brahmin was telling us these 
things and inquiring in a challenging way what 
possible use the information could be to an 
American scholar. He implied, with heavy 
irony, that we had ulterior motives. The inter­
view was obviously ended and by this time a 
small crowd of onlookers had gathered. Since 
a satisfactory answer was evidently demanded 
and since most members of the audience were 
not among the people we knew best, I took the 
opportunity to answer fully. 
I explained that prior to 194 7, India had 
been a subject nation of little interest to the 
rest of the world. In the unlikely event that the 
United States or any other country wanted to 
negotiate regarding matters Indian, its repre­
sentatives had merely to deal with the British 
who spoke for India. Indians were of no 
importance to us, for they were a subject 
people. They, in turn, had no need to know 
that America existed as, indeed, few did. Then 
in 194 7, after a long struggle, India had 
become independent; a nation of proud people 
who handled their own affairs and partici­
pated in the United Nations and in all spheres 
of international relations on a par with Britain 
and the United States. Indians for the first time 
spoke for themselves. At once it became essen­
tial for Indians and Americans to know one 
another . Consequently India sent hundreds of 
students to America, among other places, and 
we sent students such as myself to India. We 
had worked at learning their language and we 
also wanted to learn their means of livelihood, 
social customs, religion, etc., so that we could 
deal with them intelligently and justly, just as 
their students were similarly studying in and 
about America. Fortunately I had an Indian 
acquaintance, then studying a rural commu­
nity in Utah, whom I could cite as a case com­
parable to my own. I pointed out that Indian 

142 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
and American scholars had studied Indian 
cities, towns and villages of the plains so that 
their ways were well known, but that hereto­
fore the five million Paharis -residents of some 
of the richest, most beautiful, historically and 
religiously most significant parts of India -had 
been overlooked. I emphasized that Paharis 
would play an increasing role in the develop­
ment of India and that if they were to assume 
the responsibilities and derive the advantages 
available to them it was essential that they be 
better known to their countrymen and to the 
world. My research was billed as an effort in 
this direction. 
I would like to be able to report that on the 
basis of this stirring speech I was borne aloft 
triumphantly through the village, thereafter 
being treated as a fellow villager by one and 
all. Needless to say, this did not happen. My 
questioner was, however , evidently favorably 
impressed, or at least felt compelled to act as 
though he were before the audience of his 
village-mates. He responded by saying that he 
would welcome me in his house any time and 
would discuss fully any matters of interest 
to me. He also offered to supply me with a 
number of artifacts to take to America as 
exhibits of Pahari ingenuity. I might add, 
anticlimactic ally, that in fact he never gave 
me information beyond his reactions to the 
weather, and that the Brahmin, evidently 
shaken by his experience, was never again as 
informative as he had been immediately prior 
to this incident. 
The Raj put challeng er, however, ceased to bt; 
hostile whereas formerly he had been a focus 
of opposition to my presence. General rapport 
in the village improved markedly and the 
stigma attached to talking with me and my 
interpreter almost disappeared. One notable 
aftereffect was that my photographic opportu­
nities, theretofore restricted to scenery, small 
children, and adolescent boys in self-conscious 
poses, suddenly expanded to include a wide 
range of economic, ritual, and social occasions 
as well as people of all castes, ages, and both 
sexes. Photography itself soon became a valu­
able means of obtaining rapport as pho­
tographs came into demand. 
The degree to which I was allowed or 
requested to take photographs, in fact, proved 
to be a fairly accurate indicator of rapport. One of the more gratifying incidents of my 
research in Sirkanda occurred at an annual 
regional fair some eight months after the 
research had begun. Soon after I arrived at the 
fair a group of gaily dressed young women 
of various villages had agreed to be pho� 
tographed when a Brahmin man, a stranger to 
me, stormed up and ordered them to refuse. 
An elderly and highly respected Raj put woman 
of Sirkanda had been watching the proceed­
ings and was obviously irritated by the fact 
and manner of the intervention. She stepped to 
the center of the group of girls, eyeing the 
Brahmin evenly, and said, "Please take my 
photograph." I did so, the Brahmin left, and 
my photography was in demand exceeding the 
film supply throughout the fair. 
The incident described above, in which the 
Rajput challenged my interviewing of the 
Brahmin priest, came out favorably partly 
because of the context in which it occurred. 
For one thing, it occurred late enough so that 
many people knew me and my assistant. 
Having no specific cause for doubting our 
motives, they were ready to believe us if we 
made a convincing case. Also, there was a size­
able audience to the event. My explanation 
was a response to a challenge by a high-status 
villager and the challenger accepted it grace­
fully. It was the first time that many of these 
people had been present when I talked at any 
length and my statement was put with a good 
deal of feeling, which fact they recognized. It 
was essentially an appeal for their confidence 
and cooperation in a task they knew was dif­
ficult and which I obviously considered impor­
tant. They were not incapable of empathy. As 
one man had said earlier, "You may be a for­
eigner and we only poor villagers, but when 
we get to know you we will judge you as a 
man among other men; not as a foreign er." 
With time, most of the villagers demonstrated 
the validity of his comment by treating me as 
an individual on the basis of their experience 
with me, rather than as the stereotyped out­
sider or white man. 
Most important, my statement placed the 
listeners in a position of accepting what I said 
or denying their own importance as people and 
as-citizens -it appealed to their pride. They 
have strong inferiority feelings relative to non­
Paharis which account in large measure for 

ETHNOGRAPHY AND IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT 143 
their hostility, and my presence as defined in 
this statement counteracted these feelings. It 
was especially effective in response to the 
Rajput who put the challenge; a man with an 
acute, and to many aggravating, need for 
public recognition of his importance. He had 
gained some eminence by opposing my work; 
he now evidently gained some by eliciting a full 
explanat ion from me and magnanimously 
accepting it. 
Although I remained an alien and was never 
made to feel that my presence in the village 
was actively desired by most of its members, 
I was thereafter tolerated with considerable 
indulgence. I became established as a resident 
of Sirkanda, albeit a peculiar one, and no one 
tried to get me to leave. I have heard strangers 
en route to or from further mountain areas 
inquire of Sirkanda villagers as to my identity, 
presuming that I was out of earshot or could 
not understand, and be left to ponder the suc­
cinct reply, "He lives here." 
Other, less spectacular rapport-inducing 
devices were employed. Unattached men in the 
village were considered, not unjustly in light of 
past experience and Pahari morality, a threat 
to village womanhood. This fear with regard 
to my assistant and myself was appreciably 
diminished when our wives and children 
visited the village and when a few villagers had 
been guests at our house in town where our 
families normally resided. We won some good 
will by providing a few simple remedies for 
common village ailments. One of the most 
effective means of attracting villagers to our 
abode in the village during this period was a 
battery radio which we brought in; the first to 
operate in this area. It was an endless source 
of diversion to villagers and attracted a regular 
audience, as well as being a focal attraction 
for visiting relatives and friends from other 
villages. 
At first, reportedly, there had been consid­
erable speculation in the village as to why two 
people of such conspicuously different back­
grounds as Sharma and myself had appeared 
on the scene as a team if, as we claimed, we 
were not sent by the government or a mis­
sionary organization. The plausibility of our 
story was enhanced when Sharma made it 
clear to villagers that he was my bona fide employee who received payment in cash for his 
servtces. 
Villagers never ceased to wonder , as I some­
times did myself, why I had chosen this par­
ticular area and village for my research. I 
explained this in terms of its relative accessi­
bility for a hill area, the hospitality and per­
spicacity of Sirkanda people, the reputation 
Sirkanda had acquired in the area for being a 
"good village," and my own favorable impres­
sion of it based on familiarity with a number 
of similar villages. The most satisfactory expla­
nation was that my presence there was largely 
chance, i.e., fate. Everyone agreed that this was 
the real reason. Villagers pointed out that 
when the potter makes a thousand identical 
cups, each has a unique destiny. Similarly, each 
man has a predetermined course of life and 
it was my fate to come to Sirkanda. When I 
gave an American coin to a villager, similar 
comment was precipitated. Of all the Ameri­
can coins only one was destined to rest in 
Sirkanda and this was it. What greater proof 
of the power of fate could there be than that 
the coin had, like myself, found its way to this 
small and remote village. 
All of our claims of motive and status were 
put to the test by villagers once they realized 
that we planned to remain in Sirkanda and 
to associate with them. Sharma's claim to 
Brahmin status was carefully checked: exten­
sive inquiry was made about his family and 
their origins; his behavior was closely watched; 
his family home was inspected by villagers on 
trips to town. Only then were villagers satis­
fied that he was what he claimed to be. When 
all of the claims upon which they could check 
proved to be accurate, villagers were evidently 
encouraged to believe also those claims which 
could not be verified. 
That suspicions as to our motives were even­
tually allayed did not mean we therefore could 
learn what we wanted to learn in the village. 
It meant only that villagers knew in a general 
way what they were willing to let us learn; 
what impressions they would like us to receive. 
The range of allowable knowledge was far 
greater than that granted a stranger, far less 
than that shared by villagers. Although at the 
time I did not realize it, we were to be told 
those things which would give a favorable 
impression to a trustworthy plains Brahmin. 

144 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
Other facts would be suppressed and, if dis­
covered, would be discovered in spite of the 
villagers' best efforts at concealment, often as 
a result of conversation with some disaffected 
individual of low esteem in the village. Our 
informants were primarily high-caste villagers 
intent on impressing us with their near con­
formity to the standards of behavior and belief 
of high-caste plainsmen. Low-caste people 
were respectful and reticent before us, primar­
ily, as it turned out, because one of us was a 
Brahmin and we were closely identified with 
the powerful high-caste villagers. 
Three months were spent almost exclusively 
in building rapport, in establishing ourselves 
as trustwort hy, h�rmless, sympathetic, and 
interested observers of village life. In this time 
we held countless conversat ions, most of them 
dealing with the weather and other timely and 
innocuous topics. A good deal of useful ethno­
graphic information was acquired in the 
process, but in many areas its accuracy proved 
to be wanting. Better information was 
acquired by observation than by inquiry in this 
period. We found cause for satisfaction during 
this frustrating and, from the point of view of 
research results, relatively fruitless time in the 
fact that we were winning the confidence of a 
good many people which we hoped would pay 
off more tangibly later. When the last open 
opponent of our endeavor evidently had been 
convinced of our purity of motive in the inci­
dent described above, we felt that we could 
begin our data collecting in earnest. 
Until this time we had done all of our own 
housekeeping, cooking, dishwashing, carrying 
of water and firewood. These activities gave us 
opportunity to meet people in a natural setting 
and to be busy in a period when rapport was 
not good -enough to allow us to devote full 
time to research. As rapport improved we 
found our household chores too time-consum­
ing for optimal research. We attempted to find 
assistance in the village but, unable to do so, 
we added as a third member of our team a 17-
year-old boy who was of low-caste plains 
origin but had lived most of his life in the hill 
station of Mussoorie and was conversant with 
Pahari ways and the Pahari language. His role 
was that of servant and he assumed full 
responsibility for our housekeeping in the 
village. His informal contacts with some of the younger villagers were a research asset and his 
low-caste origin was not overlooked in the 
village, but otherwise he had little direct effect 
on our relations with villagers. His contribu­
tion to the research was primarily in the 
extreme reliability of his work and his cir­
cumspection in relations with villagers. 
At this point of apparent promise for pro­
ductive research, Sharma, the interpret er­
assistant, became ill and it was evident that he 
would be unable to return to our work in the 
village for some time. Under the circumstances 
this was a disheartening blow. It plunged my 
morale to its lowest ebb in the fifteen months 
of my stay in India, none of which could be 
described as exhilarating. I cannot here go into 
the details of the causes for this condition of 
morale: the pervasive health anxiety with 
which anyone is Likely to be afflicted when he 
takes an 18-month-old child to the field in 
India, especially if, as in this case, he is away 
from and inaccessible to his family a good 
share of the time; the difficulties of maintain­
ing a household in town and carrying on 
research in an isolated village; the constant and 
frustrating parrying with petty officials who 
are in positions to cause all kinds of difficulty 
and delay; the virtual lack of social contact 
outside of ones family, employees, and the vil­
lagers among whom one works; the feeling of 
being merely tolerated by those among whom 
one works and upon whom one is dependent 
for most of his social interaction. In such cir­
cumstances research is likely to become the 
primary motivating principle and its progress 
looms large in one's world view. Therefore, to 
lose an assistant whose presence I deemed 
essential to the research, when I was on the 
threshold of tangible progress after a long 
period of preparation, was a discouraging 
blow. I shall not soon forget the anxiety I felt 
during the five-hour trek to the village alone 
after learning of Sharma's illness and incapac­
ity. To await his recovery would have been to 
waste the best months for research because his 
illness came at the beginning of the winter 
slack season when people would, for the first 
time since my arrival, have ample time to sit 
and talk. In two months the spring harvest and 
planting season would begin and many poten­
tial informants would be too busy and tired to 
talk. 

ETHNOGRAPHY AND IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT 145 
After a period alone in the village, I realized 
that I could not work effectively without assis­
tance because of my inadequate knowledge of 
the language. Although I dreaded the task of 
selecting and then introducing a new and 
inexperienced assistant into the village, this 
seemed to be a necessary step to preserve the 
continuity of the research. My hope and inten­
tion was to utilize a substitute only until 
Sharma would be able to work again. Not 
wishing to spend too much time looking for a 
substitute, and with qualified people extremely 
scarce, I employed with many misgivings and 
on a trial basis the first reasonably promising 
prospect who appeared. Happily, he proved to 
be an exceptionally able, willing, and inter­
ested worker. He differed from Sharma in at 
least three important respects: age, religion, 
and experience. Mohammed, as he will here­
after be called, was a middle-aged Muslim and 
a retired school teacher who had no familiar­
ity with anthropological research. 
These facts proved to have advantageous as 
well as disadvantageous aspects. I was able to 
guide him more easily "in his work and to inter­
act more directly with villagers than had been 
the case with Sharma simply because he real­
ized his inexperience, accepted suggestions 
readily, and was interested in helping me to 
know and communicate directly with villagers, 
rather than in demonstrating his efficiency as 
a researcher and his indispensability as an 
interpreter. As a result of his age he received a 
certain amount of respect. As a Muslim he was 
able to establish excellent rapport with the low 
castes but not with the high or twice-born 
castes. Perhaps most importantly, he had no 
ego-involvement in the data. He was interested 
and objective in viewing the culture in which 
we were working, whereas Sharma had been 
self-conscious and anxious to avoid giving an 
unflattering view of Hinduism and of village 
life to an American in this unorthodox (to 
him often shockingly so) example of a Hindu 
village. Moreov er, the Brahmin, almost 
inevitably, had his own status to maintain 
before the high castes of the village while the 
Muslim was under no such obligation. 
Since it seemed probable that Sharma would 
return to work after a few weeks, I decided to 
make the best of the situation and utilize 
Mohammed in ways that would make the most use of his advantages and minimize his 
disadvantages, for he was strong where 
Sharma had been weak, and vice versa. 
While high-caste people were suspicious of 
Mohammed on the basis of his religion, low­
caste people were more at ease in his presence 
than they had been with Sharma. Furthermore, 
low-caste people proved to be more informa­
tive than high-caste people on most subjects. I 
therefore planned to utilize this assistant to get 
data about low castes and from them to get as 
much general ethnographic data as possible. I 
was counting on the return of Sharma to 
enable me to return to the high castes and my 
original endeavor to secure information from 
and about them. However , after several weeks 
it became evident that Sharma could not return 
to work in the village. By then we were begin­
ning to get a good deal of ethnographic 
material with the promise of much more. In 
addition to remarkably good rapport with the 
low castes (greater than that Sharma and I had 
had with anyone in the village) we were also 
winning the confidence of some high-caste 
people. In view of these circumstances I felt 
encouraged to continue with Mohammed and 
to broaden our contacts in the village in the 
remaining months of research. 
I had not anticipated the full implications 
for research of the differences in status of 
my associates, Sharma and Mohammed. For 
example, villagers had early determined that 
Sharma neither ate meat nor drank liquor. As 
a result we were barely aware that these things 
were done by villagers. Not long after 
Mohammed's arrival villagers found that he 
indulged in both and that I could be induced 
to do so. Thereafter we became aware of fre­
quent meat and liquor parties, often of an 
inter-caste nature. We found that these were 
important social occasions; occasions from 
which outsiders were usually rigidly excluded. 
Rapport increased notably when it became 
known that locally distilled liquor was occa­
sionally served at our house. As rapport 
improved, we were more frequently included 
in such informal occasions. Our access to 
information of many kinds increased 
proportionately. 
Mohammed's age put him virtually above 
the suspicion which Sharma had had to over­
come regarding possible interest in local 

146 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
women. Moh ammed's association with me in 
my by then generally trusted status, precluded 
undue suspicion of missionary intent or 
governmental affiliation. Probably his most 
important characteristic with regard to 
rapport was his religion. As a Muslim he was, 
like me, a ritually polluted individual, espe­
cially since he was assumed to have eaten beef. 
For most purposes he and I were untouchables, 
albeit respected for our presumed wealth and 
knowledge. 
With this description as background, the 
differential effects which my association with 
these two men had on the research can be ana­
lyzed. In discussing this topic special attention 
will be given to the implications of the status 
of each of them for the impressions we gave to 
villagers and received from them. Some of the 
more general problems of research in a tightly 
dosed and highly stratified system will also be 
considered. 
Analysis 
Erving Goffman, in The Presentation of Self in 
Everyday Life, has devised a description and 
analysis of social interaction in terms of the 
means by which people seek to control the 
impressions others receive of them. He has 
suggested that this "dramaturgical" approach 
is a widely applicable perspective for the analy­
sis of social systems. In this scheme social 
interaction is analyzed "from the point of view 
of impression management." 
We find a team of performers who cooperate 
to present to an audience a given definition of 
the situation. This will include the conception 
of [one�s] own team of [one's] audience and 
assumptions concerning the ethos that is to 
be maintained hy rules of politeness and 
decorum. We often find a division into back 
region, where the performance of a routine is 
prepared, and front region, where the perfor­
mance is presented. Access to these regions is 
controlled in order to prevent the audience 
from seeing backstage and to prevent out­
siders from coming into a performa nce that is 
not addressed to them. Among members of 
the team we find that familiarity prevails, sol­
idarity is likely to develop, and that secrets 
that could give the show away are shared and 
kept. (Goffman, 1959, p. 238) The ethnographic research endeavor may be 
viewed as a system involving the social inter­
action of ethnographer and subjects. Consid­
ered as a basic feature of social interaction, 
therefore, impression management is of 
methodological as well as substantive signifi­
cance to ethnographers. 
The ethnographer comes to his subjects as 
an unknown, generally unexpected, and often 
unwanted intruder. Their impressions of him 
will determine the kinds and validity of data 
to which he will be able to gain access, and 
hence the degree of success of his work. The 
ethnographer and his subjects are both per­
formers and audience to one another. They 
have to judge one another's motives and other 
attributes on the basis of short intensive 
contact and then decide what definition of 
themselves and the surrounding situation they 
want to project; what they will reveal and 
what they will conceal and how best to do it. 
Each will attempt to convey to the other the 
impression that will best serve his interests as 
he sees them. 
The bases for evaluation by an audience are 
not entirely those which the performer intends 
or can control. 
Knowing that the individual is likely to 
present himself in a light that is favorable to 
him, the [audience] may divide what they 
witness into two parts; a part.that is relatively 
easy for the indiv idual to manipulate at will, 
being chiefly his verbal assertions, and a part 
in regard to which he seems to have little 
concern or control, being chiefly derived from 
the expressions he gives off. The [audience] 
may then use what are considered to be the 
ungovernable aspects of his expressive behav­
ior as a check upon the validity of what is con­
veyed by the governa ble aspects. (Goffman, 
1959, p. 7) 
In their awareness of this, performers attempt 
to keep the back region out of the range of the 
audience's percept ion; to control the perfor­
mance insofar as possible, preferably to an 
extent unrealized by the audience. The audi­
ence will attempt to glimpse the back region in 
order to gain new insights into the nature of 
the performance and the performers. 
An ethnographer is usuaUy evaluated by 
himself and his colleagues on the basis of his 

ETHNOGRAPHY AND IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT 147 
insights into the back region of the perfor­
mance of his subjects. His subjects are evalu­
ated by their fellows on the basis of the degree 
to which they protect the secrets of their team 
and successfully project the image of the team 
that is acceptable to the group for front-region 
presentation. It is probably often thought that 
this presentation will also satisfy the ethnog­
rapher. The ethnographer is likely to evaluate 
his subjects on the amount of back-region 
information they reveal to him, while he is 
evaluated by them on his tact in not intruding 
unnecessarily into the back region and, as 
rapport improves, on his trustworthiness as 
one who will not reveal back-region secrets. 
These are likely to be mutually contradictory 
bases of evaluation. Rapp�rt establishment is 
largely a matter of threading among them so 
as to yvin admittance to the back region of 
the subjects' performance without alienating 
them. This is sometimes sought through 
admission to the subjects' team; it is more 
often gained through acceptance as a neutral 
confidant. 
The impressions that ethnographer and 
subjects seek to project to one another are, 
therefore, those felt to be favorable to the 
accomplishment to their respective goals: the 
ethnographer seeks access to back-region 
information; the subjects seek to protect their 
secrets since these represent a threat to the 
public image they wish to maintain. Neither 
can succeed perfectly. 
Front and back regions 
One must assume that the ethnographer's 
integrity as a scientist will insure the confiden­
tial nature of his findings about the individu­
als he studies. Those individuals, however , are 
unlikely to make such an assumption and, in 
fact, often make a contrary one. While I think 
it practically and ethically sound for the ethno­
grapher to make known his intention to learn 
about the way of life of the people he plans to 
study, I believe it to be ethically unnecessary 
and methodologically unsound to make 
known his specific hypotheses, and in many 
cases even his areas of interest. To take his 
informants into his confidence regarding these 
may well preclude the possibility of acquiring 
much information essential to the main goal of 
understanding their way of life. I think here of my own interest in the highly charged sphere 
of inter-caste relations, where admission of the 
interest to certain persons or groups would 
have been inimical to the research effort. 
Participant observation, as a form of social 
interaction, always involves impression man­
agement. Therefore, as a research technique 
it inevitably entails some secrecy and some 
dissimulation on the level of interpersonal 
relations. If the researcher feels morally con­
strained to avoid any form of dissimulation or 
secrecy he will have to forgo most of the 
insights that can be acquired through knowl­
edge of those parts of his informants' lives that 
they attempt to conceal from him. With time, 
a researcher may be allowed to view parts of 
what was formerly the back region of his infor­
mants' performance, but few ethnographers 
can aspire to full acceptance into the infor­
mants' team in view of the temporary nature 
of their residence and their status as aliens. In 
a society where ascription is the only way to 
full acceptance, this is a virtual impossibil ity. 
If the ethnographer does not gain access to 
back-region information he will have to 
content himself with an "official view" derived 
from public sources publicly approved, and his 
research interests will have to be sharply 
limited. An out for those sensitive on this point 
may be, of course, to do the research as it must 
be done but to use the findings only with the 
explicit approval of the subjects. In any case, 
the ethnographer will be presenting himself 
in certain ways to his informants during the 
research and concealing other aspects of 
himself from them. They will be doing the 
same. This is inherent in all social interaction. 
Teams and roles 
Impression management in ethnographic 
research is often an exhausting, nerve­
wracking effort on both sides, especially in the 
early phases of contact. Ethnographers may 
recognize themselves and their informants in 
this description: 
Whether the character that is being presented 
is sober or carefree, of high station or low, the 
individual who performs the character will be 
seen for what he largely is, a solitary player 
involved in a harried concern for his pro­
duction. Behind many masks and many 

148 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
characters, each performer tends to wear a 
single look, a naked unsodali zed look, a look 
of concentration, a look of one who is pri­
vately engaged in a difficult and treacherous 
task. (Goffrnan, 1959, p. 235) 
The task is especially difficult and treacher­
ous when the cultural gap between partici­
pants and audience is great. Then the 
impression that a given action will convey 
cannot always be predicted; audience reaction 
is hard to read and performance significance is 
hard to judge. Misinterpretation occurs fre­
quently and sometimes disastrously in such 
circumstances. Anyone who has been in an 
alien culture can .cite faux pas resulting from 
such misinterpretation. Inadvertent disrespect 
is a common type. Although no vivid example 
occurred in the research being reported here, 
largely due to an exaggera ted caution about · 
this, the author experienced such a misinte.r­
pretation in the course of research among the 
Aleuts. He · once amused local children by 
drawing cartoon faces on the steamy windows 
of the village store. These were seen by an 
adult who interpreted them as insulting cari­
catures of Aleuts, although they were in reality 
generalized cartoons, totally innocuous in 
intent, and he reacted bitterly. He saw them in 
the light of unhappy past experience with arro­
gant non-Aleuts. Strained relations resulting 
from this incident could well have halted 
research had it not occurred late in the 
research effort, after most villagers had been 
convinced of the ethnographer's good inten­
tions and friendly attitude. 
In a tightly closed and highly stratified 
society the difficulty of impression manage­
ment is compounded. In a closed society the 
outsider may be prevented from viewing the 
activities of its members almost completely. 
The front region is small and admittance to 
any aspect of the performance is extremely dif­
ficult to obtain. Pronounced stratific ation 
makes for many teams, many performances, 
many back regions {one for each performance 
group, as well as for each audience), and con­
siderable anxiety lest one group be indiscreet 
in revealing the "secrets" its members know of 
other groups. 
In Sirkanda the ethnographic team consisted 
of the anthropologist, an interpreter -assistant and, as a peripheral member for part of the 
time, a housebo y. This was a team in that it 
constituted 
a set of individuals whose intimate coopera­
tion is required if a given projected definition 
of the situation is to be maintained. (Goffman, 
1959, p. 104) 
Villagers considered it to be a team. In their 
eyes the actions of each member reflected on 
the others. 
The ethnograp her 
The initial response to an ethnographer by his 
subjects is probably always an attempt to iden­
tify him in familiar terms; to identify him as 
the performer of a familiar role. The impres­
sions he makes will determine how he is 
identified. 
In Sirkanda several roles were known or 
known of, under which strangers might 
appear, and each - missionar y, tax collector or 
other government agent, spy -was for a time 
attributed to our ethnographic team by some 
or all villagers as being our real, i.e., back­
region role. None of these was a suitable role 
for accomplishing our purposes and it was 
only by consistently behaving in ways incon­
sistent with these roles that we ultimately 
established a novel role for ourselves: that of 
scholars eager to learn what knowledgeable 
villagers could teach us about Pahari culture. 
I drew heavily on the familiar role of student, 
and my associates on the familiar role of 
employee or "servant." Foreign origin was an 
important aspect of my status, for I was a 
"sahib" and an "untouchable"; a person of 
relative wealth and influence but of ritually 
impure origin and habits. 
For me the former was a more distressing 
status than the latter, but an equally inevitable 
one. I was always referred to as "the sahib" by 
villagers, although I succeeded in getting them 
not to address me as such. Goffman comments 
on the differences between terms of address 
and terms of reference in this context noting 
that 
... in the presence of the audience, the per­
formers tend to use a favorable form of 
address to them .... Sometimes members of 

ETHNOGRAPHY AND IMP RESSION MANAGEMENT 149 
the audience are referred to [in their absence] 
not even by a slighting name but by a code 
title which assimilates them fully to an 
abstract category. (Goffman, 1959, pp. 
172-3) 
Perhaps the cruelest term of all is found in sit­
uations where an individual asks co be called 
by a familiar term to his face, and this is tol­
erantly done, but in his absence he is referred 
to by a formal term. (Ibid., p. 174} 
Had I been alone in the village I would have 
had a relatively free hand in attempting to 
determine whom I associated with, so long 
as I did not infringe too freely on village 
backstage life or on matters of ritual purity. 
However, since I was in almost constant asso­
ciation with an assistant whose performance 
was closely tied to my own, my status and his 
were interdependent. The definition of our­
selves which we cooperated in projecting had 
to correspond to known and observable facts 
and clues about ourselves and our purposes. 
Since to villagers my assistant was more 
conventional and hence comprehensible as a 
person than I, it was largely from him that 
impress ions were derived which determined 
our status. It is for this reason that the char­
acteristics of the interpreter-assistant were of 
crucial significance to the research effort. 
The Brahmin assistant 
Sharma, the Brahmin assistant, was able to 
establish himself before villagers as a friendly, 
tactful and trustworthy young man. As such 
he was well-liked by high-caste villagers and 
was respected by all. Once his plains Brahmin 
status had been verified, it affected the tenor 
of all his relationships, and consequently of the 
ethnographic team's relations with villagers. 
The effects of these relationships on the 
research derived from his own attempts ar 
impression management as a performer before 
several audiences, and from the attempts by 
villager s to control his impressions of them. 
Most importa ntly, Sharma was a Brahmin of 
the plains. As such, he felt obliged to convey 
an acceptable definition of himself in this role 
to the villagers among whom he worked and 
to the ethnographer for whom he worked. 
Before villagers he was obliged to refrain from 
extensive informal contacts with his caste infe-riors. He was expected to refuse to participate 
in such defiling activities as consumption of 
meat and liquor, and was in general expected 
to exemplify the virtues of his status. He was, 
in this context, acting as the sole local repre­
sentative of plains Brahmins, a group with 
which he was closely identified by himself and 
by villagers. 
In the presence of the ethnographer he 
joined a larger team, or reference group, of 
high-caste Indian Hindus. In this role he 
wished to convey a definition of Hinduism that 
would reflect well on its practitioners in the 
eyes of the foreigner . When possible he demon­
strated an enlightened, sophisticated, democ­
ratic Hinduism quite unlike that indigenous to 
the village. Since, as a Hindu, he considered 
himself a teammate of villagers, he felt obliged 
to convey to the ethnographer an impression 
of village affairs that was not too greatly at 
variance with the notion of Hinduism which 
he wished to convey. He was, therefore, reluc­
tant to discuss matters which might contradict 
the impression he had fostered -especially 
high�caste religious practices and inter-caste 
relations, the areas of most flagrant deviation 
(from his point of view) from the Hindu ideal. 
He tended, probably unconsciously, to color 
his accounts and structure our interactions 
with villagers to bias the impressions I received 
in this direction. On behalf of the ethnographic 
team, he was intent upon winning the villagers' 
acceptance and confidence, a fact which 
colored his accounts of us to them. His skill at 
impression management was evidenced by the 
rapport he achieved with both the ethnogra­
pher and the villagers, and by the fact that I, 
as ethnographer , was largely unaware of his 
manipulation of impressions until later when 
I had access to information without his 
management. 
The village team 
Villagers, too, had particular definitions of 
themselves that they wished to convey to the 
ethnographic team determined, to a large 
extent, by their interpretation of the nature 
and motives of this team. With a Brahmin in 
an important position on the team, low-caste 
people were reluctant to have close contact 
with it. High-caste people, on the other hand, 
were eager to demonstrate the validity of their 

150 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
claims to high-caste status before this patently 
high-status outsider. 
Pahari Brahmins and Rajputs (the high 
castes of this area) customarily do many things 
that are unacceptable in high-caste plains 
circles. As a result they are denied the esteem 
of such people. The appellations "Pahari 
Brahmin" and "Pahari Rajput" are often used 
in derision by people of the plains. Among 
other unorthodox activities, these Paharis sac­
rifice animals, eat meat, drink liquor, are unfa­
miliar with the scriptures, largely ignore the 
great gods of Hinduism� consult diviners and 
shamans, fail to observe many of the cere­
monies and ritual restrictions deemed neces­
sary by high-caste plainsmen, take a bride price 
in marriage, marry widows, are not infre­
quently polygynous {and in some areas are 
polyandrous), occasionally marry across caste 
lines, share wives among brothers, "sell"· 
women to men of dubious character from the 
plains. In order favorably to impress a plains 
Brahmin they must conceal these activities 
insofar as possible, and this they indeed do. 
Just as Sharma wished to convey an impression 
of enlightened Hinduism to the ethnograph er, 
villagers wished to convey their idea of enlight­
ened Hinduism to Sharma. The two aims were 
complementary. Both resulted in projection of 
an exaggerated impression of religious ortho­
doxy. This exagger ation of behavior , indicating 
adherence to the "officially accredited values 
of the society, n is a feature characteristic of 
impression management before outsiders (cf. 
Goffman, 1959, p. 35). 
Impression management of this kind is espe­
cially difficult when the intended audience, as 
in the case of the ethnogra phic team, has a 
known or suspected interest in the detection 
of back-region attitudes and behaviors, and 
when it is in intimate association with the 
performers. 
Virtually the entire village of Sirkanda was 
at first a back region for the ethnographic 
team: a great deal of the conventional behav­
ior therein was back-region behavior. Attempts 
were made by villagers to avoid "inopportune 
intrusions" which Goffman describes as 
follows: 
When an outsider accidentally enters a region 
in which a performance is being given, or when a member of the audience inadvertently 
enters the backstage, the intruder is likely to 
catch those present flagrante delicto. Through 
no one's intention, the person present in the 
region may find that they have patently been 
witnessed in activity that is quite incompati­
ble with the impression that they are, for 
wider social reasons, under obligation to 
maintain to the intruder. (Goffman, 1959, p. 
209) 
When, for instance, an opportunity arose 
for the ethnographic team to move from a 
buffalo shed on the periphery of the village to 
a house in its center, village.rs' desire to main­
tain a modicum of overt hospitality wavered 
before their covert alarm until an untouchable 
was induced to place an objection before the 
potential intruders. The objection had the 
desired effect although it was immediately 
repudiated by its high-caste instigators, who 
blamed it upon the irresponsible meddling of 
a mere untouchable. They thus assured the 
continued privacy of the village while main­
taining their front of hospitality. The untouch­
able who voiced the objection had been 
coerced and bribed with liquor to do so. He 
later commented that villagers had said that 
people, and especially women, would be inhib­
ited in the performance of their daily rounds if 
strangers were to be continuously in their 
midst; that is, the backstage .would be exposed 
to the audience. 
Before the ethnographic team the village at 
this time presented an apparently united front. 
Villagers of all castes cooperated not only in 
concealing things inimical to the high-caste 
performance, but also those thought to reflect 
adversely on the people as a whole. For 
example, an intra-caste dispute among 
untouchables came to a head at a high-caste 
wedding where the disputants were serving as 
musicians. While the disputants were pre­
senting their case to an informal council of 
high-caste guests which had convened one 
afternoon, a heated argument erupted. It was 
suppressed and the council disbanded with the 
explicit warning that the ethnographer would 
. hear and think ill of the village. 
During this period of the research, untouch­
ables were usually relegated to an unobtrusive 
secondary role, largely in the back region.

With a Brahmin on the ethnographic team and 
with high-caste people as our associates, low­
caste viJiagers were disinclined to associate 
with us, much less to reveal backstage infor­
mation. We were in their view associates of the 
high-caste team and as such were people to be 
treated cautiously and respectfully. High-caste 
villagers could not reveal such information 
to us either because we were, in their view, 
members of the plains Brahmin team and a 
source of potential discredit to high-caste 
Paharis. 
Ethnographic information that was acquired 
in this context was largely of a sort considered 
innocuous by villagers -observations about 
the weather and current events, agricultural 
techniques, etc. Much of it was distorted. For 
example, our initial genealogies omitted all ref­
erence; to plural wives; accounts of marriage 
and other ritual events were sketchy and 
largely in conformance with the villagers' con­
ception of plains orthodoxy. Some of the infor­
mation was false. Most of it was inaccessible. 
The back region ��s large and carefully 
guarded. Yet relations between the ethno­
graphic team and the village were relatively 
congenial. 
The Muslim assistant 
When after four months the Brahmin assistant 
was replaced by a Muslim, there were impor­
tant consequences for the villagers' conception 
of the ethnographic team and consequently 
for their performance before that team. The 
progress and results of the research reflected 
these changes. 
Mohammed, the Muslim assistant, was 
respected for his age and learning, liked for his 
congeniality and wit, but doomed to untouch­
able status by his religion. This did not disturb 
him. As an educated and not particularly reli­
gious Muslim he had little personal involve­
ment in the caste hierarchy of the village and 
little vested interest in the ethnographer's 
impression of village Hinduism. As an indi­
vidual he was objective and interested but 
concerned more with projecting to villagers a 
favorable view of the ethnographic team than 
any particular image of his personal status. As 
a performer he played a less prominent role 
than his predecessor . This was reflected in his 
interpreting. Sharma had preferred to interpret virtually all statements and to direct the course 
of conversation to keep from offending vil­
lagers (and embarrassing himself) by treading 
on dangerous ground. Mohammed was 
anxious that communication between ethnog­
rapher and subjects be as direct as possible; 
that conversation be as undirected as possible 
except when particular topics were being 
pursued. Consequently interpreting occurred 
only as necessary; ethnographer and subjects 
determined the direction of conversation. 
As an audience, the Muslim' s effect on the 
village performance was drastically different 
from the effect of the Brahmin. High-caste 
people did not wish to associate openly with a 
Muslim, for he was by definition ritually 
impure. He was in no sense their fellow team 
member as the Brahmin had been; he was in 
some respects almost as alien as was the 
ethnographer himself. Consequently, high­
caste villagers' behavior became correct but 
distant: informal conversations and visitations 
decreased in frequency; the ethnographer was 
told in private by some high-caste villagers that 
they could no longer associate closely with 
him. 
Low-caste people, on the other hand, 
became less inhibited than formerly was the 
case. When by experimentation they found 
that the Muslim was apparently oblivious to 
caste, these people began to be friendly. In the 
vacuum of social interaction left by with­
drawal of the high castes, they were not 
rebuffed. The effect was circular and soon the 
ethnographer's dwelling became identified as 
primarily a low-caste area. 
Not all high-caste people were alienated, but 
most preferred to talk in their own homes, 
with low castes excluded, rather than in the 
ethnographer's house. Some would visit the 
ethnographer only when they had been 
assured that no low-caste villagers would be 
present. 
In these circumstances the village no longer 
presented the aspect of a unified team. Now it 
became clear that the village was divided. 
From the point of view of the high castes there 
were at least two teams: low and high castes. 
The former feared the power of the latter; the 
latter feared the revelation of back-region 
secrets that might be given by the former. From 
the point of view of low castes there seem to 

152 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
have been at least three teams: high castes, 
"our caste" and (other) low castes. High 
castes were feared and resented; other low 
castes were to some extent competitors for 
status before outsiders. Competition took the 
form of conflicting claims as to the type and 
nature of interaction with one another, each 
caste claiming to treat as inferiors (or some­
times as equals) others who, in turn, claimed 
equal · or superior status. Actually, in the 
context of the closed village a good deal of 
interaction took place among low castes with 
few status considerations. 
Low-caste teams 
The position of low castes -the untouchables 
-was an interesting one relative to the village 
team and its performance. Untouchables were 
in a position such that they might easily admit 
an audience to backstage village secrets. They 
were members of the village team perfm:ce, 
but they were uneasy and not fully trusted 
members. Goffman has appropriately stated 
that: 
One overall objective of any team is to sustain 
the definition of the situation that its per­
formance fosters. This will involve the 
over-communication of some facts and 
the under-com munication of others. Given the 
fragility and the required expressive coherence 
of the reality that is dramatized by a perfor­
mance, there are usually facts which, if atten­
tion is drawn to them during the performance, 
would discredit, disrupt, or make useless the 
impression that the performance fosters. 
These facts may be said to provide "destruc­
tive information . ., A basic problem for many 
performances, then, is that of information 
contro4 the audience must not acquire 
destruCtive information about the situation 
that is being defined for them. In other words, 
a team must be able to keep its secrets and 
have its secrets kept. (Goffman, 1959, p. 141) 
In Sirkanda, low-caste people are in a posi­
tion to know high-caste secrets because all vil­
lagers are in almost constant contact with one 
another; they have little privacy. Castes are not 
separated physically, socially, or ritually to the 
extent that they are in many areas. Low-caste 
and high-caste cultures, including back-region 
behavior, proved to be very similar among these hill people (cf. Berreman, 1960b). But, 
for low-caste people the back region -the part 
that is to be concealed -is much smaller than 
for high-caste people. They do not feel oblig­
ated to protect village secrets to the extent that 
high-caste people do simply because their pres­
tige and position are not at stake. They do not 
share, or are not heavily committed to, the 
"common official values" which high-caste 
people affect before outsiders. High-caste men, 
for example, were careful to conceal the fact 
that, in this society, brothers have sexual 
access to one another's wives. However, a low­
caste man who had listed for the ethnographer 
the name and village of origin of the women 
of his family, including his wife and his broth­
ers' wives, was not embarrassed to remark, 
when asked which was his wife, that "They are 
all like wives to me." A more striking contrast 
was evidenced in attitudes toward village reli­
gious behavior. After some time, low-caste 
people encouraged the ethnographer to attend 
their household religious observances wherein 
possessed dancing and animal sacrifice 
occurred. High-caste villagers did not want the 
ethnographer to be present at their own per­
formances of the same rituals. Some of them 
also objected to my presence at the low-caste 
functions and exerted pressure to have me 
excluded. The reason was apparently that 
high-caste people felt such behavior, if known 
outside, would jeopardize their claims to high 
status. High-caste people, recognizing that 
village culture was essentially the same in all 
castes and that I was aware of this, felt their 
position threatened by the performance of the 
low-cast es. Low-caste people had no such 
status to maintain. 
Low-caste people, unlike their high-caste 
village-mates, had little prestige at stake in out­
siders' conceptions of the Pahari way of life. 
They were not competing with plains people 
for status nor seeking acceptance by them to 
the extent that the high castes were. People 
assume the worst about untouchables so they 
have little to gain by concealment. This is not 
to say that there is no particular definition of 
their situation that untouchables try to project, 
9r that it takes no effort to perpetuate it; the 
lowest-status group in Sirkanda, for instance, 
has tried to suppress its reputation for prosti­
tution by giving up some of the activities asso-

ciated with it. But the range of such back­
region secrets among low castes is limited in 
comparison to that among high castes. It does 
not extend to Pahari practices as such, but 
instead is limited primarily to those few prac­
tices crucial to their status competition with 
other low castes in the village and, even more 
importantly, to negative attitudes toward the 
high castes-attitudes which must be concealed 
in view of the power structure of the society. 
Goffman notes that 
... to the degree that the teammates and their 
colleagues form a complete social community 
wbicb offers each performer a place and a 
source of moral suppon ... , to that degree it 
would seem that performers can protect them­
selves from doubt and guilt and practice any 
kind of deception . (Goffman, 1959, pp. 
214-=-15) 
It is because, in this highly stratified society, 
moral support and rewards are allotted on the 
basis of caste that high-caste performers 
cannot trust their low-caste colleagues to 
sustain the performance - to practice the 
deception -voluntarily. Low-caste people 
resent their inferior position and the disad­
vantages which inhere in it (cf. Berreman, 
1960a). Not only are they uncomm itted to the 
village performance which is largely a high­
caste performance; they are in private often 
committed to discrediting some aspects of this 
performance. Both of these are facts of which 
the ethnographer must be aware. As a result 
of them, if low-caste members feel they can do 
so in safety, they are not reluctant to reveal 
information about village life which embar­
rasses high-caste villagers. They may also, of 
course, manufacture information intended to 
discredit their caste superiors� just as the latter 
may purposely purvey false information to 
justify their treatment of low castes. The 
ethnographer must be constantly alert to the 
likelihood of such deceptions, using cross 
checks, independent observation and the ljke 
for verification. Eventually he can identify reli­
able informants and the subjects upon which 
particular inform�nts or categories of infor­
mants are likely to be unreliable. 
That high-caste people recognize the vuJner­
ability of their performance and are anxious about it is revealed in their suspicion and 
resentment of low-caste association with out­
siders, such as the ethnographic team. Anyone 
who associates too freely with such outsiders 
is suspected of telling too much, but only low­
caste villagers are suspected of telling those 
facts which will seriously jeopardize the status 
of the dominant high castes. The suspicion that 
low castes are not entirely to be trusted to keep 
up the front is therefore not paranoia on the 
part of those they may reveal; it is a real 
danger. On the other hand, high-caste 
members encourage assoc1at10n between 
strangers and low castes by sending the latter 
to appraise strangers who come to the village 
and, if possible, to send them on their way. By 
so doing high castes avoid the risks of being 
embarrassed or polluted by the aliens. At the 
same time they increase low-caste opportuni­
ties for outside contact, acquisition of new 
ideas, etc., and they thereby increase their own 
anxieties about low-caste behavior and atti­
tudes. They are apparently more willing to face 
this anxiety than to risk initial personal 
contact with strangers. As a result, some low­
caste people are more at ease with strangers 
and more knowledgeable about them and their 
thought patterns, than are most high-caste 
people. 
Since they are not willing to extend to low 
castes the status, power, and material rewards 
which would bring them into the high-caste 
team or commit them to the high-caste per­
formance, high castes rely heavily on threats 
of economic and physical sanctions to keep 
their subordinates in line and their secrets, 
which these people know, concealed from out­
siders. To the extent that low-caste people do 
sustain the performance they are evidently 
responding to their fear of high-caste reprisals 
more than to an internalized commitment to 
the perform ance. 
High-caste teams 
Even high-caste villagers do not present a 
united front or consistent performance on all 
matters. Bride-price marriage, for example, is 
traditional in these hills and until recent times 
only poverty accounted for failure to pay for 
a bride. To high-caste people of the plains 
bride-price marriage is reprehensible; a dowry 
is always demanded. This attitude has had irs 

154 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
effect in the hills so that Paharis, and especially 
those of high caste, not infrequently forgo the 
bride price in a wedding. There was an inter­
esting division of expressed attitude among 
high-caste villagers in Sirkanda on this matter. 
Although there was no consistent difference 
among families in practice, some claimed that 
their families would never accept or demand a 
bride price while others claimed that their fam­
ilies would never give or take a bride without 
an accompanying bride price. I was unsuc­
cessful in attempting to account for this dif­
ference in terms of the economic, educational, 
or other readily apparent characteristics of 
those concerned. I finally realized that it was 
largely a function of the relationship of the 
particular informant to me and my assistant 
and, more specific ally, the impression the 
informant wished to convey to us. Many 
wanted to convey a picture of plains ortho­
doxy and, not realizing that we knew othe.r.:­
wise, or hoping that we would think their 
families were excepti ons, they tailored their 
accounts of the marriage transaction to fit this. 
A few, notably some of the older men of the 
Rajput landowning caste, wanted to convey 
their conception of the proper Pahari tradition, 
perhaps in view of the fact that they knew we 
were aware of their practice of bride-price 
marriage and that to conceal it was by then 
useless. They expressed disapproval of dowry 
marriage and disclaimed willingness to be 
parties to such arrangements. They explained 
that as Raj puts they would not take charity (as 
a Brahmin would) and would insist on paying 
for anything they got, including a wife; con­
versely they would require payment for their 
daughters, because one does not give charity 
to other Rajputs. Moreover, gift brides die 
young and do not produce heirs, they asserted. 
Some villagers were more frank than either of 
the above groups when they got to know us, 
and described quite freely the specific circum­
stances under which bride price and dowry 
were and were not included in recent marriage 
transactions. 
On at least one occasion highly controver­
sial information was revealed by a Rajput 
because of an erroneous assumption on his 
part that others in his caste had been telling 
the ethnographer the story in a manner 
uncomplimentary to himself. Early in the research I learned that the village had been 
riven by a legal battle over land begun some 
twenty years previously, and although I knew 
in a general way who and what was involved, 
I had not ascertained the details. One evening 
the proudest, most suspicious and tight-lipped 
of the members of the winning faction 
appeared unexpectedly at my house, lantern in 
hand, and without introduction proceeded to 
recount the nine-year legal battle blow-by­
blow. He was evidently attempting to coun­
teract information which he presumed the 
losing faction had given me. I was subse­
quently able to check his version with several 
other versions from both sides in order to 
reconstruct approximately the factors involved 
in this complex and emotionally loaded 
episode. 
Thus, high-caste members are not entirely 
free of suspicion and doubt regarding the 
extent to whkh they can rely upon their 
teammates to sustain their performance. Even 
among high castes there are different perfor­
mances which various groups try to project to 
one another and occasionally to outsiders. 
Lines of differential performance and impres­
sion management among them most often 
follow kin group and caste affiliation. These 
high-caste performance teams are usually fac­
tional groups in the village, competing and dis­
puting with one another. They often attempt to 
disparage one another within, the high-caste 
context by such means as questioning purity of 
ancestry. The head of the largest family in 
Sirkanda, a member of one of the two large 
Raj put sibs of the village, expressed doubt that 
the other large sib, to which his wife (the 
mother of his five adult sons) belonged, was 
actually and legitimately a Rajput sib. This was 
a recurrent theme. Often cleavages between 
high-caste groups involved long-standing dis­
putes over land and/or women. 
High-caste performance teams also differed 
from one another in the age, sex, education, 
and outside experience of their members. 
Groups so defined can be described as perfor­
mance teams because they differ in the defini­
tions of their own and the village situation 
w:hich they attempt to project to various audi­
ences. Rarely, however, do they desert the 
high-caste team before outsiders or low castes, 
the two most crucial audiences. 

ETHNOGRAPHY AND IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT 155 
The same kinds of statements can be made 
about particular low castes, although the low 
castes as a group rarely cooperate to put on a 
team performance. Usually, each low caste sus­
tains its own performance, attempting to sub­
stantiate its claims to status relative to other 
low castes adjacent in the hierarchy. 
[ ... ] 
Data, secrets, and confidence 
As rapport increased and back-region infor­
mation accumulated it became possible for 
the ethnographic team to accomplish useful 
research on a broader scale -to understand 
forme.rly incomprehensible activities and atti­
tudes; to relate previously disparate facts, to 
make more sensible inquiries, to cross-check 
and verify information. The effect was cumu­
lative. As we learned more, more information 
became accessible. By being interested, uncrit­
ical, circumspect, and meticulous about 
maintaining their trust, we won villagers' 
confidence. For example, high-caste people 
who avoided close contact with Mohammed in 
the village visited his home in town and even 
ate with him, with the plea that he tell no one 
in the village. No one ever discovered these 
indiscretions, and those who committed them 
were not unap preciative. Contrary to villagers' 
early fears, no missionaries, policemen, tax 
officers, or other outsiders came to Sirkanda 
as a result of what we learned there. We tried 
to show our increasing knowledge in greater 
comprehension of our environment, rather 
than by repetition of items of information. 
As we learned more, concealment from us 
decreased because we were apparently already 
aware of, and largely indifferent to, many of 
the facts about which villagers were most self­
conscious or secretive. We took for granted 
things some villagers supposed were "dark 
secrets" (i.e., things contrary to the impression 
they hoped to convey to us) and far from our 
knowledge (cf. Goffman, 1959, p. 141). When 
we had asked, in genealogical inquiry, what a 
man's wife's name was, we always got one 
name. When we later found that polygyny was 
not uncommon we asked first how many wives 
a man had and thereby got accurate informa­
tion. Most villagers were unaware that our 
interests went beyond formal genealogical records, economic techniques and ritual obser­
vances. Many secrets were revealed largely 
because of the apparent casualness of our 
interest in them, and because villagers had 
become accustomed to our presence in the 
village so that we were not considered to be as 
critical an audience as had once been the case. 
Some of the most revealing instances of 
social interaction occurred between people 
who were apparently oblivious to the fact that 
the ethnographer was present. Frequently this 
was a temporary lapse. A performance for the 
ethnographer would be abandoned as tension, 
convivialit y, concentration on a topic of con­
versation, or some other intensification of 
interaction occurred among the participants. 
Such instances of preoccupation with one 
another were conspicuous by the fact that atti­
tudes were expressed or information divulged 
that would normally be suppressed. The 
breach in the performance would sometimes 
be followed immediately, or after some time, 
by embarrassment, apology, or anxious efforts 
to counteract its presumed effect on the ethno­
grapher's view of the village or of those 
involved in the incident. Minor instances of the 
same phenomenon were frequent sources of 
insight into the functioning of the society, and 
sources of confirmation or contradiction of 
informants' data. 
The accuracy of information on back-region 
subjects could often be checked through infor­
mants who would not have intentionally 
revealed it, by bringing the subject up naturally 
in conversation as though it were a matter of 
general information. That is, it was defined by 
the ethnographer as no longer restricted to the 
back region of the performance to which he 
was audience. 
Some "secrets," however, could not be ade­
quately verified simply because to do so would 
precipitate difficulty for all concerned, espe­
cially for those who would be suspected of 
revealing the secrets. Such secrets ranged from 
gossip about various past transgressions and 
indiscret ions by particular families or individ­
uals, to the fact that villagers of all castes were 
reported to eat occasionally the flesh of 
animals such as deer and goats found freshly 
dead or killed in the forest. One low-caste man 
told me there were secrets he could not reveal 
until I had my pack on my back and was 

156 GERALD D. BERREMAN 
leaving the village permanently. He was afraid 
that some intimation of my knowledge might 
leak out and he would be punished as the only 
one who would have revealed the damaging 
information. �er I had said my final farewells 
this man journeyed sixteen miles to my home 
in town, primarily, to be sure, to get some 
utensils I had offered him, but partly to tell me 
some incidents which he had been afraid to tell 
or even hint at during my residence in the 
village and which he would not tell in the pres­
ence of my assistant or any other person. These 
incidents had to do primarily with the sensi­
tive area of inter-caste and other illicit sexual 
behavior among powerful members of the 
community. 
To this man, as well as to other low-caste 
friends, the ethnographer had become what 
Goffman refers to as a "confidant," one who 
is located outside of the team and who partie- · 
ipates " ... only vicariously in back and fro.nt 
region activity" (Goffman, 1959, p. 159). In 
this role I had access to a range of information 
not often accessible to those who came from 
outside the group. Where group membership 
is by ascription this seems to be the only fea­
sible role for which the ethnographer may 
strive. 
Certain secrets remained too dark to be told 
even by those who trusted us most. The village 
remained a team, united in its performan ce, 
with regard to some practices or beliefs which 
were too damaging to all (or to certain pow­
erful high-caste people) to permit their revela­
tion to an outsider . 0 bviously, like the perfect 
crime, most of these remain unknown. Indica­
tions of a few of them were received, however . 
For example, one old dispute which resulted in 
a factional split among Rajputs would have 
escaped me had not an old man referred to it 
briefly, bitterly, and inadvertently. Despite my 
best efforts I learned nothing about it beyond 
his chance remark that it involved a man and 
woman of the disputing sibs seen talking and 
laughing together at the water source some 
generations ago. Even the most willing infor­
mants would only say that "Those people are 
all dead now so it doesn't matter." 
I learned that some Paharis occasionally sac­
rifice a buffalo to their gods, but that this has 
never occurred in Sirkanda. I was convinced that this was the case when considerable 
inquiry and observation seemed to verify it. 
Then, shortly before my final departure, a dog 
deposited the embarrassing evidence of such a 
sacrifice - the neatly-severed head of a buffalo 
calf-on the main village trail shortly before I 
chanced by. Villagers of all castes refused to 
discuss the matter in which all were obviously 
implicated. My one opportunity for a candid 
explanation occurred at the moment of dis­
covery when I asked a child at my heels which 
god the buffalo had been sacrificed to. A reply 
seemed imminent until his elder, a few steps 
back on the trail, caught up and silenced the 
discussion as well as all chance for future fruit­
ful inquiry on the subject. Villagers thought 
that to plains people this would seem akin to 
cow-killing, the greatest sin of all, and so it had 
to be rigorously concealed. 
The sacrifice had evidently occurred during 
my absence from the village. 
If an individual is to give expression to ideal 
standards during his performance, then he 
will have to forgo or conceal action which is 
inconsistent with these standards. When this 
inappropriate conduct is itself satisfying in 
some way, as is often the case, then one com­
monly finds it indulged in secretly, in this way 
the performer is able to forgo his cake and eat 
it too. (Goffman, 1959, p. 41) 
/ 
It was six months after my arrival before 
animal sacrifices and attendant rituals were 
performed in my presence, although they had 
been performed in my absence or without my 
knowledge throughout my residence in the 
village. Likewise, it was not until after Sharma 
left that I witnessed drinking and meat-eating 
parties in the village. 
Since I left the village for two or three days 
every week or so, there was an opportunity for 
essential and enjoyable back-region activity to 
be carried on quite freely in my absence, and 
this opportunity was not neglected. In fact, it 
probably made my research in the village much 
more bearable to villagers than if I had been 
there constantly. It was largely the threat to 
�heir privacy that motivated villagers to make 
sure that I did not take up residence in the 
center of the village (as described above), but 
continued instead to live on its periphery. No 

ETHNOGRAPHY AND IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT 157 
doubt one of the most anxiety-producing situ­
ations known to man is to make public that 
which he considers to be private, back-region 
behavior. 
[ ... ] 
Impressio n management in 
pursuit of research 
Finally, my own behavior was tailored for my 
village audience. I carefully and, I think suc­
cessfully, concealed the range of my interests 
and their intensity in some matters -such as 
inter-caste relations. I refrained from going 
where I was not wanted, even when I could 
have gone without being challenged and when 
I very much wanted to go. One instance 
occurred when I decided not to move into the 
proffered house in the center of the village. As 
anoth'er example, I never attended a village 
funeral. On the two occasions upon which I 
could have done SO; I found that there was 
considerable anxiety lest my presence upset 
guests from other villages, though Sirkanda 
villagers claimed they\vould welcome my pres­
ence. There was evident relief when I stayed 
home. 
In the village I concealed the extent of my 
note-taking, doing most of it at night or in 
private. I felt free to take notes openly before 
only a few key informants, and then only after 
I had known them for a considerable time. I 
recorded some kinds of detailed information, 
such as genealogies and crop yields, in the 
presence of all informants when I found that 
I could do so without inhibiting responses 
appreciably. This, too, took time and circum­
spection. Some subjects, such as ceremonial 
activities, could be freely recorded before some 
informants and not at all before others. I dis­
carded my plans to use scheduled interviews 
and questionnaires because I thought they 
would do more harm in terms of rapport than 
good in terms of data collection, in view of 
village attitudes and my relationship with vil­
lagers. I never took photographs without per­
mission. I concealed such alien practices as my 
use of toilet paper - a habit for which for­
eigners are frequently criticized in India. I took 
up smoking as a step to increase rapport. I 
simulated a liking for millet chapaties and 
the burning pepper and pumpkin or potato mixture which makes up much of the Pahari 
diet. Even more heroically, I concealed my dis­
taste for the powerful home-distilled liquor, 
the consumption of which marked every party 
and celebration. Such dissimulations were 
aimed at improving rapport and they were 
worth the trouble. In this behavior a front was 
maintained in order to sustain a particular def­
inition of my situation; a definition which I 
thought would increase my access ro village 
backstage life, thereby contributing to the ulti­
mate goal of understanding the lifeways of 
these people. 
Conclusion 
In such a society as this the ethnographer is 
inevitably an outsider and never becomes oth­
erwise. He is judged by those among whom he 
works on the basis of his own characteristics 
and those of his associates. He becomes iden­
tified with those social groups among his sub­
jects to which he gains access. The nature of 
his data is largely determined by his identity as 
seen by his subjects. Polite acceptance and even 
friendship do not always mean that access will 
be granted to the confidential regions of the life 
of those who extend it. The stranger will be 
excluded from a large and vital area if he is 
seen as one who will not safeguard secrets, and 
especially if he is identified as a member of one 
of those groups from which the secrets are 
being kept. 
Sharma was a high-caste plainsman and 
consequently identified with very important 
groups in the village, groups rigorously 
excluded from large areas of the life of both 
high-caste and low-caste villagers. As such he 
could likely never have achieved the kind of 
relationship to villagers which would have 
resulted in access to much of the life of 
Sirkanda. Access to that information was 
essential to the ethnographer because it con­
stituted a large proportion of all village atti­
tudes and behaviors. Mohammed was able to 
gain substantial rapport with the low castes. 
In view of the attitudes of villagers and the 
social composition and power structure of the 
village, the low castes were the only feasible 
source of information which high-caste 
villagers considered to be embarrassing,

damaging or secret. They were a reasonably 
satisfactory source of such information about 
the entire village because all castes were in 
such close contact that they had few secrets 
from one another and did not differ greatly in 
culture. This i"s not to say that the information 
obtained was complete or totally accurate, but 
only to assert that it was much more so than 
would have been the case had Sharma been my 
assistant throughout the research. 
Thus, there is more than one "team" which 
makes up Sirkanda; more than one definition 
of the village situation is presented or may be presented to the outsider. As the ethnographer 
gains access to information from people in dif· 
ferent social groups and in different situations 
he is likely to become increasingly aware of 
this. 
The question of whether the performance, 
definition or impression fostered by one group 
is more real or true than that put forth by 
another, or whether a planned impression is 
more or less true than the backstage behavior 
behind it, is not a fruitful one for argument. 
All are essential to an understanding of the 
social interaction being observed.
