and my brothers I greet you and also I thank 
you for inviting me to speak to the topic at 
hand. As I was preparing my thoughts, I 
begged the Maker of all things to be among 
us, to give us some wisdom and also maybe to 
make my works be as a medicine for us all -
those were my thoughts. 
We, a.s Indian people, have welcomed 
strangers into our midst. We have welcomed all 
who came with intellectual curiosity or in the 
guise of the informed student. We have 
honored those whom we have seen grow in 
their knowledge and understanding of our 
ways. But unfortunately , many times we have 
been betrayed. Our honored guests have shown 
themselves to be no more than peeping toms, 
rank opportunists, interested in furthering 
their own careers by trading in our sacred tra­
ditions. Many of our people have felt anger at 
the way our communities have been cheated, 
held up to ridicule, and our customs sensa-tionalized. Singer Floyd Westerman (Dakota), 
for example, expressed this anger in his 1969 
recording of "Here Come the Anthros." 
We have been observed, noted, taped, and 
videoed. Our behaviors have been recorded in 
every possible way known to Western science, 
and I suppose we could learn to live with this 
if we had not become imprisoned in the 
anthropologists' words. The language that 
anthropologists use to explain us traps us in 
linguistic cages because we must explain our 
ways through alien hypothetical constructs 
and theoretical frameworks. Our ezhibe­
mahdizawin must be described as material 
culture, economics, politics, or religion. We 
must segment, fragment, fracture, and pigeon­
hole that which we hold sacred. The pipe, 
d'opwahganinan, becomes a sacred artifact, 
a religious symbol, a political instrument, a 
mnemonic device, an icon. 
We have to describe our essence, 
d'ochichaugwunan, to fit academic conceptual 
packages, and we have become prisoners of 
what academics have done to our words to 
verify their words. We want to be given the 
time, money, luxury, and security of academic 
credibility to define our own constructs from 
within our own languages and our own worlds 
and in our own time. 
We struggle as contemporary Indian, Metis, 
and Inuit peoples to unlock the classificatory

chains choking our dynamic languages and 
growing, changing lives. How can we learn 
how our language is structured, how our 
world of languages was created, if we still must 
parse, analyze, and chop them up to fit the 
grammar of other languages ? How can we 
define who we are, what we see, and what we 
think when the public, politicians, and policy 
makers have accepted the prepackaged images 
of who we are, as created by anthropologists? 
I am an Odawa. I speak Odawa, but anthro­
pologists have preferred to say I speak Ojibwe. 
My language is an Algonquin language, I am 
told, and it is structured by describing things 
as animate or inanimate, so I am told. English 
definitions of the terms "animate" and "inani­
mate" lead people to think of things being 
alive or not alive. Is this how our language is 
structur ed? I think not. In Odawa all so-called 
inanimate things could not be said to be dead. 
Does animate then mean having or posses­
sing a soul? Is this a sufficient explanation? I 
think not. Is the animate-inanimate dichotomy 
helpful in describing the structure of my lan­
guage? I think that it is limiting, if not wrong 
outright. For in Odawa anything at some time 
can be animate. The state of inanimateness is 
not the denial or negation of animateness as 
death is the negation of the state of aliveness. 
Nor can something have a soul and then not 
have a soul and then acquire a soul again. In 
Odawa the concept of animateness is limitless. 
It can be altered by the mood of the moment, 
the mood of the speak er, the context, the use, 
the circumstances, the very cosmos of our 
totality. English terms imprison our under­
standing of our own linguistic concepts. 
Having to define ourselves from the start 
with inappropriate English terms is not suffi­
cient for our understanding. It is confining, 
and it is wrong. It seems that we must first 
defend ourselves against scholarly categories. 
We must find a way to break out of these 
cages. That takes a lot of unnecessa ry, unpro­
ductive time and energy and money. 
In the last twenty years, Indian, Metis, and 
Inuit peoples have moved from reservations 
and isolated communities into places of greater 
visibility, but they are seen through the ima­
ges built out of anthropological studies of 
them. We have been defined as "poor folks," 
members of a "minority" or "less sophisti-cated cultures "; we have been called "tribal," 
"underdeveloped," "nomadic," "less fully 
evolved." Therefore, real Indians are poor. 
You have provided us with the cop-outs: 
"Indian time" if we are late, "It's not the 
Indian way" if we don't want to do something. 
Employers have acquired cop-outs for not 
hiring Indians: Indians don't like competition, 
Indians don't like to work inside, Indians like 
seasonal employment. Teachers excuse the 
lack of Indian graduates. Indians themselves 
find excuses for their lack of employment, 
education, or dignity. 
Now, we as Indian, Metis, and Inuit people 
want self-dete rmination. We want self­
government. When will anthropologists 
become instrumental to our ambitions, our 
categories of importance ? How helpful is it to 
be called tribal or primitive when we are trying 
to negotiate with national and provincial 
governments as equal nations? Anthropologi­
cal terms make us and our people invisible. 
The real people and the real problems disap­
pear under the new rhetoric. Indian, Metis, 
and Inuit problems defined incorrectly lead to 
inappropriate solutions, irrelevant programs, 
and the reinforcement of the status quo. The 
real problems remain unresolved, and the 
Indian, Metis, and Inuit are again redefined. 
The cumulative effects of all this are now 
evident. We have been redefined so many times 
we no longer quite know who we are. Our 
original words are obscured by the layers upon 
layers of others' definitions laid on top of 
them. We want to come back to our own 
words, our own meanings, our own defini­
tions of ourselves, and our own world. Now 
scholars debate among themselves the ethics to 
be used in working in our communities and 
homes. It is as if they are organizing the 
feeding schedule at the zoo. We want to escape 
from the zoo. We want to be consulted and 
respected as not only human beings, at the 
very least, but as independent nations with the 
right to determine what transpires within our 
boundaries. We want to say who comes to our 
world, what they should see, hear , and take 
away. Most important, we want to appraise, 
critique, and censure what they feel they have 
a right to say about us. 
We acknowledge, with gratitude, the 
attempts by the National Endowment for the 

--HERE COME THE ANTHROS 193 
Humanities and the American Anthropologi­
cal Association to regulate researchers by 
guidelines or codes of ethics. However , for 
most of us, these efforts are part of the 
problem. For we must ask: Whose ethics? In 
this era of aboriginal self-government, it is not 
for the outsider to set the rules of conduct on 
our lands and in our communities. It is our 
right and responsibility as aboriginal nations 
to do that. It is the right and responsibility of 
researchers to respect and comply with our 
standards. The dictates of Western science and 
the standards of behavior enshrined by asso­
ciations of researchers dedicated to the 
advancement of social science may or may not 
be compatible with the code of ethics of our 
aboriginal communities. 
Creative approaches must be discussed and 
debated by aboriginal communities, acaderruc 
institutions, and individual researchers to 
reach a working relationship that neither con­
stricts the advancement of knowledge nor 
denigrates the aboriginal commun ities' legiti­
mate authority over the �ntegrity of their own 
intellectual traditions. · 
Let me dose with a story. I had a dream that 
all the peoples of the world were together in 
one place. The place was cold. Everyone was 
shivering. I looked for a fire to warm myself. 
None was to be found. Then someone said that in the middle of the gathering of Indians, what 
was left of the fire had been found. It was a 
very, very small flame. All the Indians were 
alerted that the slightest rush of air or the 
smallest movement could put the fire out, and 
the fire would be lost to humankind. All the 
Indians banded together to protect the flame. 
They were working to quicken the fragile, 
feeble flame. The Indians were adding minus­
cule shavings from small pieces of wood to 
feed it. 
Suddenly, throughout the other peoples, the 
whisper was heard: The Indians have a fire. 
There was a crush of bodies stampeding to the 
place where the flame was held. I pushed to 
the edge of the Indian circle to stop those 
coming to the flame so that it would not be 
smothered. The other people became abusive, 
saying that they were cold too and it was our 
responsibility to share the flame with them. I 
replied, "It is our responsibility to preserve the 
flame for humanit y, and at the moment it is 
too weak to be shared, but if we all are still 
and respect the flame it will grow and thrive 
in the caring hands of those who hold it. In 
time we can all warm ourselves at the fire. But 
now we have to nurture the flame or we will 
all lose the gift." 
Those are my words. Meegwetch.
