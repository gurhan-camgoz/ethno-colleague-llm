Return to Laughter 
Elenore Smith Bowen 
Chapter Two 
Early th'e next morning, I sat contentedly on 
my veranda drinking coffee made just to my 
taste. My emphatic orders-"Fruit and coffee, 
and then leave me alone" -had been obeyed. 
I don't like being rushed into a day before I am 
ready for it. I need to stretch my senses awake, 
slowly, without disturbance, just as I need to 
stretch my limbs into life before I get out of 
bed. Certainly, it's not until my third cup of 
coffee that I am fully awake and willing to face 
the consequences of that condition. 
I was still drinking my second cup when 
Sunday suddenly materialized at my elbow. 
Surprised, I looked up and met at eye level a 
bowl of seething gray ooze. At my irritated 
frown, Sunday vanished as rapidly and quietly 
as he had come; he knew some Europeans 
dislike porridge. Before I could rouse my sleep­
ing wits, he was back with a large plate of eggs 
and fried toast. 
It was well for justice that I could expostu­
late only through the cook's interpreta tion. 
While he crossed the yard and Sunday stood 
stiffly in the doorway , I reminded myself into 
patience. The English like a large breakfast. 
Indeed, in a country like theirs, where people 
apply the principles of insulation and central 
heating to themselves rather than to their 
houses, a large and greasy breakfast has a 
certain functional value which disappears in the tropics. The Englishman abroad maintains 
his traditions tenaciously; he drills them into 
his servants. I had asked for trained servants; 
I had, perforce, British-trained servants. I 
could scarcely communicate with my boys; 
they had misunder stood. I must explain. 
Once more I tried to tell the cook that I 
wanted nothing but fruit and coffee in the 
morning. His air of reproachful resignation 
showed me that he thought his skill as cook 
was involved. I wanted to tell h1m it was not 
so; the chef who could tempt me to breakfast 
does not exist. Bur explanation without words 
is impossible. ''Fruit, coffee good; eggs, por­
ridge bad." We could say no more to each 
other. 
A stir on the path released our deadlock. 
Once again Kako paced slowly into the rest­
house yard, followed by h1s bright tram of 
notables. He had come, as he had told Sack­
erron he would, to teach me his language. I 
sent the boys out to welcome him, while I 
searched for a notebook and gulped my coffee 
like a harassed commuter. 
Once again we sat outside in the shade of 
the tree, smiling and shaking fists in greeting. 
Once again Kako and his notables produced 
pipes; the same little boy ran into the kitchen 
for coals; the same two women stood behind 
Kako. Today, however each action was a 
lesson. By the time their pipes were going, I 
had written and repeated pipe, pipes, coals,

flint and steel. At Kako's prompting they 
showed me bags and spears, pointed to chairs, 
sheepskins and articles of dress, drilling me on 
each word by the simple technique of saying it 
a bit louder with each repetition. They opened 
bags: out came snuff stands, kola nuts, odd 
bits of cloth wrapped around shillings and 
pennies. With them, we came to an end. 
Kako sent the younger woman and the little 
boy running. Through the cook he told me that 
now we were to start on the real pith of 
the lesson. I turned to a fresh page in my 
notebook. 
Kako pointed to himself and pronounced his 
name. I beamed encouragingly upon him, for 
above all I wanted to learn people by name -
as many and as quickly as possible. When 
Kako named, I repeated and wrote. When he 
pointed, I looked intently for identifying signs: 
that man was very thin; that one was lame; 
that one was reddish; that one almost purple­
black. All of them were elaborately scarred, 
and the more distinctive patterns of scarifica­
tion proved the most reliable means of identi­
fication. Beards can be removed. What's 
worse, when these people shave, beard, mus­
tache, hair and eyebrows all go, transforming 
a white-haired elder into a youthful billiard 
ball. However , this time -with all of them 
sitting together and in the same place - I was 
able to close my notebook and repeat all their 
names correctly. Kako informed me that I had 
done well. 
The woman and the little boy returned, each 
with armfuls of leaves. Kako spread about a 
dozen out on the ground before me, and 
named them one by one; then the next dozen, 
and on and on. Some, he told me, were edible. 
By pointing at the farms to the north of the 
resthouse and the bush to the south, he 
informed me which were cultivated. Kako 
broke off; he needed all his attention for light­
ing his pipe with the matches I had given him. 
My instruction was taken over by lkpoom, 
whose name and face I could easily remember 
because his eyes were so sad and he was so 
very ugly. Ikpoom, also pointing, taught me 
the words for path and bush, farm and fallow, 
earth and heavens, correcting my constant mis­
takes far more patiently than Kako had done. 
And I made many. Theirs is one of the simpler 
African languages, yet it was months before it seemed the only natural way to speak: a flow 
of fat, firm consonants and comfortable 
vowels, quite unlike the breathy hisses of 
English. 
By nine o'clock that morning, I had several 
pages of words, and my tongue was limp from 
unaccustomed twisting. Unable to take in any 
more, I instituted a review by again naming the 
notables. I again got most of them right: the 
right man and almost the right sound. Kako 
looked on me with favor. Encouraged, I 
demanded the names of the women. They 
smiled, but Kako ignored my question and 
turned firmly back to the leaves. Rather reluc­
tantly I began to name them. With every word 
Kako became more dour. I spoke more loudly; 
my pronunciation couldn't be that bad. 
lkpoom 's eyes grew sadder; the women seemed 
incredulous. The little boy could bear it no 
longer. He snatched from me the leaf I was 
naming and handed me another. The order had 
been mixed, and not once had I put the right 
name to the right plant. 
These people are farmers: to them plants are 
as important and familiar as people. I'd never 
been on a farm and am not even sure which 
are begonias, dahlias or petunias. Plants, like 
algebra, have a habit of looking alike and 
being different, or looking different and being 
alike; consequently mathematics and botany 
confused me. For the first time in my life I 
found myself in a community where ten-year­
old children weren't my mathematical superi­
ors. I also found myself in a place where every 
plant, wild or cultivated, had a name and a 
use, and where every man, woman and child 
knew literally hundreds of plants. None of 
them could ever believe that I could not if I 
only would. 
Kako gave me that long and incredulous 
glare with which a brilliant father regards his 
backward child. Then he insisted that we start 
all over again. I stared at the leaves. I fingered 
the leaves, and drew the leaves. But the only 
leaf I could identify almost every time was the 
very distinctively pronged cassava leaf. I con­
fused com with guinea corn and at least three, 
very similar wild grasses. I couldn't and still 
can't, tell one kind of yam leaf from the next. 
The little boy, no more than eight years old, 
stood beside me and prompted me; he knew 
them all. I was discouraged. Kako lost heart. 

RETURN TO LAUGHTER 501 
He became politely bored, and promised we 
should try again some other, unspecified time. 
Then he drew his toga more closely about him 
and withdrew. 
I was left with the leaves and my notebook 
and a strong regret that I hadn't chosen to 
study a people like the Bedouin who have 
camels and a desert, both readily identified. I 
went back to the veranda; after one brief 
glance at my notebook, I stacked the leaves 
neatly in a corner. I was tired of leaves; I hadn't 
come here to learn botany. I moved outside 
again and occupied myself by staring at the 
stream of people that had been filing along the 
path behind the saplings since early morning. 
They were all going in the same direction, 
scores of them, almost on each other's heels. 
Most of them turned their heads to stare at me, 
and some shouted greetings, but none of them 
paused. 1 Men passed, dragging recalcitrant 
goats, sheep and sometimes pigs by a rope 
around the animal's neck. Women in gaudy 
waist cloths balanced on their heads cal­
abashes filled with greens and gourds, cotton, 
peppers or bundles tied in leaves. They were 
followed by their children, also with some­
thing on their heads: smaller calabashes with 
smaller bundles, or sometimes a tiny stool. A 
solitary boy, knock-kneed and naked, carried 
a tiny bamboo cage with a disconsolate song 
bird inside it. A young dandy clad in a very 
small cloth, but smeared bright red with 
cam wood, headed a group of musicians -their 
drums slung over their shoulders, one of them 
piping a bamboo flute. 
"A market.'' Excitedly I thought of going 
myself. Then I felt my blisters and decided 
against it. The boys, however, took turns at 
visiting the market; from them I learned it was 
held every fifth day and was only a few 
hundred yards down the path. By eleven the 
procession toward the market trickled to an 
end. From the east I could hear the dull roar 
of voices. 
A man, who had been sitting all day by the 
path leading into the resthouse yard, looked 
up from his knitting. He nodded in the direc­
tion of the noise and said something. Word list 
and notebook in hand, I sat down beside him. 
"The market is roaring," he knitted on; it was 
a red and black scarf, I noticed, and he was 
using bicycle spokes as knitting needles. Like everything else that can be done while attend­
ing court sessions and other important meet­
ings, knitting is man's work. Woman's proper 
occupation is weeding and cooking. 
"Everyone comes to Kako's market," the 
man continued. I began to wonder what he 
wanted here and of me, and why he should 
prefer to sit here. He could not mean to go on 
to market later: people were already beginning 
to return, though still only one and two at a 
time. 
After lunch, when I went outside again, the 
man was still sitting there. A rather burly 
young woman, with a clown's mask of white 
bath powder on her face, started to come past 
him, beyond the pale of saplings and into my 
yard. He shouted. She ignored him. He dashed 
toward her, his arm raised as though to strike. 
I jumped up, shouting and frowning at the 
man, greeting and smiling at the woman. She 
turned toward me, volubly. I could only greet 
and smile. She shrugged, then stood stock still 
and stared at me. 
Another woman saw us; she too started in. 
Again the man tried to drive her our. I objected 
through the cook, but the cook refused to 
translate. He managed to tell me that Kako 
had placed this man here to keep the people 
coming to and from the market out of the rest­
house grounds. 
I was furious: so Kako meant to keep me 
from meeting people. Hastily and angrily I 
announced that anyone who wished to see me 
should be free to do so; I had come here to 
meet people and to get to know them; there­
fore I was going to talk to everyone who 
wished to greet me. My boys protested: no 
European did such a thing. They were quite 
right; mentally-and conditionally-I absolved 
Kako of unwarranted interference. Aloud I 
firmly overrode my boys: I was not like other 
Europeans; I had come here with the sole 
purpose of meeting people and talking to 
them. They refused to move from the entrance. 
I countered by dragging my chair out to the 
path. There 1 sat down. 
By this time more people were leaving the 
market. One after the other they stopped, 
greeted me, and drew to the side of the path 
to join the cluster of people that just stood and 
stared at me. The cluster grew into a crowd. I 
found myself sitting like a smiling waxwork 

502 ELENORE SMITH BOWEN 
figure on silent exhibition to the curious. I sat 
on, determined to make clear by my actions 
what I could not explain in words. Surely 
coming out here to greet people would prove 
that I welcomed them all. 
I grew bored, and I was very glad to catch 
sight of an almost familiar face. It was one of 
the notables, Poorgbilin, the fat friendly one. I 
hailed him with loud cordiality, and escorted 
him and his wife into the resthouse yard. The 
crowd streamed in after us. I had been too suc­
cessfully emphatic with the knitting man. He 
sat back, aloof and sullen. 
Poorgbilin and I sat down in the shade of 
the tree. The crowd formed a tight palisade 
around us. Poorgbilin ignored them. I could 
not: they were so many and so close, yet so 
inaccessible beyond the barrier of language. I 
hadn't bargained for so many people. Poorg­
bilin had his wife take her market purchases 
out of her calabash. He named each object as 
she laid it on the ground: indigo, cotton, okra, 
palm oil. The crowd watched and listened, 
quiecly, intently. Beniseed, beans, camwood -
a word with one simple vowel safe between 
unspeakable consonants. I rushed at the word, 
and stuttered to an ignominious stop. Irre­
pressible laughter swept about me. I smiled, 
half embarrassed, at the grinning mob; they 
laughed again. Poorgbilin shook his head; his 
wife picked up her purchases. The crowd 
opened for them, and they left. 
I also started to leave the yard, but no path 
opened for me. The circle of people merely 
extended itself, moving amoebalike as I 
moved, still I stood, still among them, just 
outside my door. I motioned them to one side. 
Many of them smiled; no one budged. 
An old woman stepped forward, holding 
out a bottle filled with a thick orange liquid. 
Automatically I smiled and spoke: "Palm oil." 
A pleased murmur rippled about me. The 
crowd had found an amusement. They too 
would teach me their language. A youth waved 
some corn at me, calling out the word. I was 
silent. He spoke more loudJy, shaking a 
corncob at me like a scolding finger. I looked 
at him, undecided: all my life I have had to 
avoid crowds for fear of fainting; I didn't want 
to offend anyone -they were so many ... I 
looked again at their expectant faces, and 
spoke: "Corncob. " Two raised voices cor-rected me. Again I tried. Several more took up 
the refrain, chorusing "corncob" more loudly 
and yet more loudly each time, until the whole 
throng was screaming "cornc ob." Someone 
giggled at the noise; the shouting became a gale 
of laughter. A boy held out a banana. A 
woman poked a spindle at me. Again I 
responded. Again I became the target of their 
scream mg. 
More and more people. I could no longer see 
through the press of sweating bodies. A gang 
of tipsy youths elbowed forward. They puJied 
things out of the women' s calabashes to thrust 
at me, yelling until my ears ached from their 
noise. I couldn't hear. I couldn't think. I could 
no longer distinguish anything individual in 
the laughing mass of mobile faces. There was 
no unpeopled air to breathe. 
ln all earnest now, I pushed toward my door. 
Those just before my hands tried to draw back; 
they could clear no more than a narrow lane. 
I slipped through, and collapsed in the corner 
of my veranda. They would not follow: I had 
learned in the station that a European' s house 
is sanctuary. 
They made no attempt to follow, though the 
pressure behind made those in front bulge 
slightly into the doorway. The rest flowed, like 
deflected water, along the edge of my veranda 
-crouching outside to peer through the slit 
between thatch and veranda wall, inserting 
head and elbows to see the better. Women held 
their children high and at arm's length over the 
wall: "Look at the European!" The European 
is their bogy man. The children howled in their 
mothers' stiff clutch. A drunken young man 
snatched a child: "I'll g.ive you to the 
European!" The child writhed in desperation 
and fell terrified onto the veranda floor. His 
mother forced her way in. 
The mob poured in behind her. I jumped to 
my feet. 
They surged forward, laughing, shouting. 
Cheerfully , in friendliest fashion, they 
swarmed about me, penning me into the 
corner. The odor of recently consumed beer 
and the indescribably rotten smell of locust 
beans hit me like a blow. Nauseated and half 
faint I leaned against the wall. I called for my 
boys. Cassava, corn, indigo -anything with a 
name- thrust against my face. Words hurled 
at me. Again I called. No one could hear. A 

RETURN TO LAUGHTER 503 
girl tugged at my skirts to show me her cas­
tanets. A bent hag reached out to touch my 
hair. The noise, the smell of hot, excited bodies 
closed over me. 
A determined young woman shoved her way 
to the fore: broad-cheeked, a stubby pipe 
clenched between her teeth, her hair in a score 
of tight French braids close against the scalp. 
She put her hand on my arm. I moved to dash 
it away. She clasped my outstretched hand 
tightly by the thumb -the sign of friendship. 
She shouted her name: Atakpa. 
Then she turned her strong, straight back 
square upon me, like a shield against the mob. 
Arms akimbo, she harangued them, and one 
by one, raggedly , they dropped their shouting. 
She spoke on, assured, without hesitation. She 
gestured at me with a toss of her head. There 
was a great roar of laught er. Then, without 
more a db, she grabbed me by the wrist, talking 
all the while, and drew me behind her, limp 
and unresisting through the crowd. 
Out onto the path we went, the crowd 
parting before us and closing in behind to 
follow, in single file, for the path was narrow 
and the grass sharp. Atakpa released me. I fol­
lowed her gladly, hobbling a bit on my blisters, 
but delighted to breathe fresh air. Eventually 
we turned aside into a rather small and ram­
shackle homestead. The thatch on the huts was 
smoke blackened even to the outside, and 
many of the roofs were bent and gaping. A 
plump baby sat in a litter of leaves and corn 
husks, eating dirt. Atakpa, again taking my 
wrist, pulled me into the central reception hut, 
on hands and knees through the low door way. 
I stood up, coughing with the smoke and 
feeling, rather than seeing, the first of the 
crowd push in behind me. 
Beyond me, invisible in the smoke and dark, 
an old man's voice exploded angrily: '4Get out! 
Get out!" As I turned to go, Atakpa pulled me 
down onto a very low bench-actually a plank 
bed cut from a single tree trunk. Here, below 
the smoke, my eyes began to clear. While the 
old man's furious voice raged on, I made out 
the fire, a high platform over it supported by 
four teakwood posts, and close to the fire, the 
author of all the noise: a hale old man in dark 
red camwood and a ragged toga fallen from 
hjs shoulders. He rose, clutching the cloth to 
him with both hands, still snarling loudly. The crowd which had followed us disappeared -
out of the reception hut we sat in, out of the 
homestead. 
I sat on where Atakpa had placed me, dazed, 
without curiosity. I realized only that it was 
quiet. Atakpa vanished. The old man, Yabo, 
again lay back in his reclining chair and stared 
into the fire. I made out one or two old women 
in the shadows behind him. Atakpa returned 
with a young man. She introduced him. She 
pointed to him, to herself and then to the old 
man, repeating words. I smiled at them all, 
vaguely and without real interest. Atakpa 
began to scold. I shook my head. With a short, 
exasperated grunt, she tapped the back of my 
hand. I looked down and saw my notebook 
and pencil still in my hand, still open to the 
few erratic scribbles that marked the onset of 
the crowd. 
While I still stared, Yabo stirred and 
growled at Atakpa. Soon I found myself eating 
a freshly roasted ear of corn. Then she brought 
what looked like a mass of wet, white clay and, 
in a separate dish, a slimy green substance. I 
smiled, rubbed my stomach, and waved my ear 
of corn in my effort to look well fed. Atakpa 
rather reluctantly removed the dishes: Y�bo 
and the young man ate them. In their place, 
she brought me the din-eating child and once 
more started pointing and talking. To please 
her, I listlessly jotted some syllables of non­
sense. But Atakpa had a genius for making her 
meaning clear. I suddenly realized that she was 
reaching me those anthropological favorites -
kinship terms - and I fell to writing happily. 
This, I resolved, was the way I wanted to do 
fieldwork: in quiet, among JUSt a few people 
at a time, and in their own homes. But how? 
I might not find everyone as hospitable as 
Atakpa. 
The sun was low when Atakpa dragged me 
back to the resthouse. I went unwillingly, half 
afraid that the crowd might still be there. I 
slumped together with relief when I saw the 
knitting man and my boys once more standing 
guard against passers-by. With an 1-told-you­
so attitude just short of impertinence, they 
inquired whether they were to let people in. 1 
replied rather stiffly that the day was over. Pri­
vately, while I nursed my blistered feet and my 
shattered nerves in a hot bath, I wondered how 
to hit the happy medium between seeing no 

504 ELENORE SMI TH BOWEN 
one and being hounded by a mob. I could not 
expect to be welcomed in their homesteads if 
I refused to receive them in mine. 
Sunday came at my call. Once again he 
started to lead me out into the yard to my deck 
chair and my evening selection of drinks. I, 
however , wanted to stay inside, where I could 
not be seen. I motioned him to leave the lamp. 
Sunday pleaded; his frantic gestures of expla­
nation included all the heavens. I was 
adamant. Monday came in, dragging my tent. 
He laid it at my feet. Sunday's finger pointed 
to an unmistakable hole in the thatch. A roll 
of thunder from the southern mountains com­
pleted the demonstration. In sudden compre­
hension, bowing and waving like animated 
puppets, Sunday and I pointed to roof and tent 
and ropes: he meant to give me a second roof 
of canvas inside my hut, hanging the ground 
sheet over the veranda and the tent itself over 
my bed and boxes. I would be underfoot 
inside. 
I went out to my deck chair. There was no 
one about. Even the knitting man had gone. 
Only the swelling thunder broke a silence so 
clear that I could hear Sunday's muttered 
instructions to Monday as the two of them 
worked to secure me against the wet. 
I, however, was even more concerned with 
my protection against people. I had come 
prepared to combat shyness and suspicion, 
expecting to be shunned and alone. I had 
known I must struggle to break through the 
fear and respect usually shown to Europeans -
a respect that leaves one behind a glass wall, 
visible and untouchable. Today I had learned 
that these people were quite as willing to touch 
me as to stare. It was, it seemed, easy enough 
to make oneself the center of a curious crowd. 
But still withheld . from any real contact. 
Wrapped in my difficulties, I ate absently , 
inattentively waved Sunday good night, and 
sat on gazing blindly into the dark beyond my 
circle of lamplight. The heralding thunder, the 
approaching storm wind that blew keen under 
the thatch, roused me from my absorption and 
sent me to bed for warmth. There I told myself 
that it was only the thunder that kept me 
awake. Only the thunder; not the memory of 
raucous shouting, of smothered air, of people 
thrusting, handling, forcing screaming children 
at me. I tossed myseU into bad dreams. The pleasant rustle of rain in the thatch 
greeted my waking. I wanted coffee, but I lay 
on in bed listening for voices and wondering 
how many people were watching outside. The 
rain leaking through my thatch tapped against 
my canvas ceiling. It must be raining very hard. 
I sat up. No one would be out in this weather. 
I peered cautiously round the edge of my mat 
door. The rain-swept yard was empty. I went 
out. 
Sunday brought papaw and coffee. I ate and 
drank, lit a cigarette and stared absently at the 
rain-pocked earth outside, tiny mud craters 
lifted and shifted by the pelting rain. Sunday 
appeared at the kitchen door, holding my 
umbrella over a precarious structure of dishes. 
I eyed him with foreboding while he tenderly 
unwrapped the dishes and set before me a 
repulsive plate of steaming sardines. 
"Take it away!" I yelped. The missionar y's 
word list had some very practical phrases in it. 
"Take it away!" Sunday started off with the 
coffee. In this language the pronouns depend 
on the class of objects; I had indicated a liquid 
''it." "Return with it," I countermanded. With 
almost aggressive resignation, Sunday brought 
back the coffee. I pointed at the sardines and 
repeated "take"; I did not dare repeat the 
liquid "it." Sunday first provided the correct 
pronoun. Then he gave advice. I resorted to the 
word list and discovered that I would get very 
thin and something else not listed. 
Again I summoned the cook. As he so right­
eously pointed out, I had said only: "Eggs bad, 
porridge bad." With a sigh, I began a painstak­
ing condemnation of every breakfast dish I 
could imagine. This time he seemed to under­
stand. Sardines in hand, he turned to go. At 
the very door he turned around with the light 
of last hope in his eyes. "Beans on toast?" he 
suggested. I rejected his offer vehemently . The 
cook departed sadly. 
I picked up the word list. Clearly I could not 
even influence my destiny until I could talk. 
The crowd had listened to Atakpa. But how 
could I hope to imitate her, when I could nor 
make my own cook understand about my 
breakfast? I sat down to my task. The rain 
dripped from the trees, onto the thatch, 
through the thatch and onto the canvas. 
Against its tapping I mumbled words and 
phrases, over and over. Yet I was not really 

RETURN TO LAUGHTER 505 
aware of what I uttered, for my ears were 
attentive to the rain, dreading any sign of its 
lessening, dreading the sunshine that would 
bring people forth. 
The word list was dead. I tossed it aside 
impatien tly. To learn I needed to hear people 
speak; to do my job I had to know at least a 
few of them intimately. Whatever else had 
been done yesterday, it had been made clear 
that I was prepared to see everyone. That 
could be turned to advantage. To set a guard 
at my gates now would destroy anything I had 
gained. In any case, no matter whom I might 
choose, I would give that person the power of 
selecting with whom I talked and thus what I 
came to know. That wouldn't work. What, 
then? I stretched out on my bed to think. 
It was hot when I awoke, and clear. The yard 
was full of women's chatter punctuat ed with 
laughter and the teasing, off-duty voices of my 
boys. I peered out. About a dozen women were 
sitting under my tree, knee deep in calabashes 
and children. I hid behind my mat, wrestling 
with a sensation I came to know all too well: 
I wanted to talk to people! I couldn't bear to 
meet them. Even months later, when I could 
converse with ease and had my friends among 
these people, there remained that momentary 
pause, that same need to compel myself into 
their midst. It was very like the instinctive hes­
itation of the most ardent swimmer just before 
he plunges into the sea. I liked to be among 
them, just as I liked to be in the sea, but neither 
ever became my natural element. 
I forced myself out into the yard. The 
women clustered about me, chattering gaily, 
thrusting small gifts of corn and eggs upon me. 
I accepted and smiled and wrote down names. 
1 recognized Atakpa and greeted her. I sat 
down with them on the roots of the tree, but 
I could not give them my full attention. My eye 
was on the path. Two g,irls passed, saw us, 
turned back and came in. My heart sank. 
Atakpa was saying something. I paid no heed, 
afraid of another crowd, not knowing what to 
do to avoid it. Atakpa was shouting and point­
ing to somethmg behind me. I sh rugged my 
incomprehension; my eyes were fixed on the 
path. 
Something soft and wet struck at me, below 
and behind. I scrambled away. It was a small, 
shiny tree frog. Atakpa was laughing, repeat-ing the word she had screamed at me. If it had 
been a scorpion ... I tried to grin, and resolved 
hereafter to pay attention to what was told me. 
The frog leaped at Atakpa. She jumped. I too 
began to laugh. Soon the frog, like a mouse at 
a bridge party, had all the women on their feet, 
giggling and screeching. Monday disposed of 
the frog, and we settled down again. 
Atakpa said something about Yabo. I could­
n't understand, but I remembered how he had 
chased the crowd from his homestead and 
wished I knew the secret. Several of the women 
began to chorus Atakpa's words, more and 
more loudly. Atakpa turned on them, silenced 
them, and repeated her speech softly. Gradu­
ally, with the help of my cook and the word 
list, 1 understood: so much shouting was bad; 
many people were a bad thing; I should talk 
to two or three at a time. l agreed heartily. 
Atakpa said I should come live with her at 
Yabo's homestead; there I could learn the lan­
guage and no one would bother me. 
For a moment I toyed with the idea. Then J 
remembered how small, how dilapidated and 
dirty Yabo's homestead was. Besides my boys 
seemed genuinely concerned: if I were to live 
any place but the resthouse, it must be in the 
chief's homestead. I suddenly recalled that 
Yabo had not been among Kako's collection of 
notables. Atakpa was still coaxing: it was not 
good to live in the bush alone. She threatened 
me with snakes, ants and witches. The boys 
were in complete agreement about the dangers 
she listed; there were few of us; we were some 
distance from the closest homestead, and again 
the whole group chorused: "It's nor good to sir 
alone in rhe bush., 
It rook a long rime ro frame my questions 
and to understand their answers. At Kako's 
homestead would I see anyone besides his 
own people? "All the world comes ro a 
chief's homestead, and they would all greet 
you - a Europea n., Would they come as they 
had on market day? They were impatient: no 
crowd would push like that, uninvited (the 
boys were being tact ful), into the homestead 
of anyone of importance, let alone into that of 
a chief. 
I began ro hope. True, I had planned to live 
separately at first, to avoid identifying myself 
with any part of the community till I knew 
something of the factions within it. By now,

however , I was quite willing to shelter behind 
the chief's toga, if he would let me do so. But 
where would I live in his homestead and would 
he want me always underfoot? 
The swift parting of the women and a flurry 
of greetings interrupted my vacillation. Kako 
himseU stood before me, presenting a large and 
active ram prancing stiff-legged at the end of 
a rope. As soon as I had thanked him, he con­
fided that his heart was troubled. With pater­
nal concern he informed me that in my present 
location I was exposed to snakes and ants (he 
omitted the witches). It was not good to sit 
alone in the bush. Would we move down to his 
homestead? He would build me a hut for 
myself, one for the boys, and a kitchen and 
reception hut right next to his own huts in his 
homestead. As quickly as I could, almost 
before I was sure that I understood him cor­
rectly, I accepted. As we started off for his homestead to select 
the exact site then and there, I felt I was for­
tunate indeed to be among such kind, hos­
pitable folk. Much later, when Kako and I 
knew each other from months of living within 
whispering distance, he confessed that he had 
been quite ready to insist on my moving down 
where he could keep an eye on me. He had not 
thought me able to take care of myself, and 
Sackerton held him responsible. I had, it 
seemed, been an embarrassment to the Native 
Administration. That afternoon, however, I 
felt only gratitude for his kindness. I walked 
back to the resthouse praying that Kako would 
build as promptly as he had promised, that I 
could move soon, and that until then it would 
rain a little every day and all day on market 
day. I vowed to pay better attention to words 
and frogs and leaves. I was not, as yet, con­
cerned by snakes and ants and witches.
