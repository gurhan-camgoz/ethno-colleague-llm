Afghanistan, Ethnography , 
and the New World Order 
David B. Edwards 
Anthropolo gists do not usually -or at least 
they are not usually thought to -comment on 
global issues. The anthropological perspective 
is generally assumed to be a localized one. We 
are the resident observers of particular places, 
usually obscure ones, and until recently at least 
we have been relatively happy with our obscu­
rity. Strange things happen, however. Events 
move beyond our control, and fieldwork sites 
that seem to be as remote and insignificant as 
any on the planet suddenly take on a global 
significance that forces the most nocturnal of 
researchers into the light. When I first decided 
to be an anthropologist, it was basically 
because I wanted an excuse to go back to 
Afghanistan to carry out a traditional sort of 
village study in some mountain commun ity. I 
had worked for two years as an English 
teacher in Kabul in the mid-1970s, had fallen 
in love with the place, and it seemed that 
anthropology offered a way to spend more 
time in parts of the country I would otherwise 
not be able to visit. So, I started graduate 
school, and in the meantime a revolution hap­
pened that changed my plans. 
Mghanistan' s obscurity may have been part 
of what appealed to me in the first place, but 
for the last ten years I have been trying to come 
to grips with its notoriety, its confusion, and 
its disparate energies. Since 1982, I have 
carried out fieldwork in a variety of places, including the city of Peshawar , Pakistan, and 
various refugee camps scattered around the 
Northwest Frontier Province. One summer , 
I also traveled inside Afghanistan to observe 
the operations of a group of mujahidin, and 
I have spent quite a bit of time among 
Afghan refugees in the Washington, DC, area. 
Finally, and most recently, I have been moni­
toring the activities of an Afghan computer 
newsgroup. 
All of these experiences have collectively 
contribut ed to what I know about Afghans 
and Afghan culture, and I have found that 
this knowledge is not easily divisible. Though 
distant in space, the different contexts are not 
isolated from one another. What goes on inside 
Afghanistan affects what is happening in the 
camps, just as both of these situations influ­
ence (and are influenced by) the lives of 
Afghans in more distant locales. The various 
attempts I have made over the years to isolate 
single parts of this larger totality, so that I 
might be able to produce a more traditional 
sort of community study, have always been 
frustrating for me. In a sense that I did not rec­
ognize until recently, these attempts repre­
sented traumatic amputations of what I know 
and what I have experienced, and not surpris­
ingly, they resulted in texts that have felt 
partial, incomplete, and vaguely untruthful. 
Somehow I have needed to find a mechanism

that would reflect more closely the whole story 
as I understood it, a story that is not confined 
to any one point in time or space. 
What follows is the partial product of recent 
attempts to address the problem of represent­
ing the spatially discontinuous and temporally 
disjointed nature of my fieldwork experience. 
In pursuing this end, I have been led to employ 
what might be called a contrapuntal, rather 
than a traditional, linear structure of exposi­
tion, and to move into and out of ethnographic 
place rather more freely than is usually done. 
The objective in employing this style of writing 
is not to develop any particular theoretical 
point. It is rather to pull together , in one place, 
experiences that are otherwise separate and 
distinct in time and space bur that seem in 
some marginally inchoate way to need each 
other's company . 
One effect of assembling these vignettes in 
one place is to transgress the normal concep­
tion of what constitutes "fieldwork." Tradi­
tionally framed as a rite de passage through 
which all anthropologists had to pass, the idea 
of fieldwork carried with it certain definite 
obligations, for instance that it be conducted 
over a calendar year and that it take place in 
an exotic locale in some sort of bounded com­
munity like a village or a hunter-gatherer 
settlement. This conception of fieldwork, as 
venerable as it might be, is no longer adequate 
to the reality of shifting boundaries and 
migrating cultures. People don't stay in one 
place any more -if they ever did -and the 
notion that the terms culture, community, and 
place are more or less synonymous cannot be 
sustained. 
The good news in all this, I think, is that, 
despite the proliferation of media-driven con­
sumerism crossing every mountain range and 
border on the planet, the monoculture of our 
nightmares does not seem to be developing. 
Cultural differences still abound, and cross­
cultural contact appears to be accelerating the 
process of hybridization as much as it is that 
of homogenization. One result of this -for 
anthropologists at least - is that, while the 
distant cultures we have traditionally studied 
are no longer so easily isolable or exotic as 
they were in the past, those that are closer to 
home are also a great deal more strange and 
interesting than we ever imagined. Paktia 
It is a morning in May 1984. I have had my 
breakfast of bread and tea and am taking a 
morning walk through the tiny village of 
Serana, in the territory of the Zadran tribe 
in south-central Paktia Province, eastern 
Afghanistan. Paktia Province has long enjoyed 
the reputation of being the most fiercely in­
dependent region of Afghanistan. Time and 
again, the tribes of Paktia have poured out of 
the mountains to challenge the government of 
Kabul's right to rule. That is why I have come 
here -to see firsthand this yaghistan -this 
place of rebellion -but so far at least I have 
not met very many native Paktiawal. Most 
people have left the area, and I have seen only 
a handful of children and hardly any women 
at all since arriving. 
It is cool in the mountains, cool enough that 
the few people I pass wear their shawls 
wrapped tightly around their shoulders. 
Climbing a short hill on the outskirts of the 
village, I see a mullah with a billowy white 
turban seated in the chair of a two-barrel 
Dashika antiaircraf t gun. The Dashika is a 
Soviet design, but markings on the gun indi­
cate that it is of Chinese manufacture. These 
guns are shiny and new and only recently 
arrived by camel caravan across the Pakistani 
frontier. The mullah is young-late-twenties -
and he scans the sky for signs of Soviet MiGs. 
Only a few weeks before, mujahidin gunners 
had brought down a MiG-23 not too far from 
here, and there is fighting going on not too far 
away; so the mullah is keeping careful watch. 
As he does so, he listens to a cassette on his 
Japanese tape recorder of an Egyptian muezzin 
chanting verses from the Qur'an. 
We continue on around the perimeter of 
the base, climbing as we do toward another 
antiaircraft gun emplacement located on a 
ridge overlooking Serana. When we reach the 
heights, we see another Afghan gunner 
manning a four-barrel Zigoyak gun, also 
Soviet-designed and Chinese-made, also 
recently arrived in the base. This is the largest­
caliber gun in their arsenal, and the best 
gunners have been assigned to maintain and 
fire it. There are three gunners present, all ex­
soldiers from the Afghan army. It is not sur­
prising to find soldiers here. The area is 

AFGHANIS TAN, ETHNOGRAPHY , AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER 349 
overrun with them, and it seems that the 
majority of people I have talked with during 
my trip have been recruits and conscripts from 
distant parts of the country, who have taken 
refuge with the mujahidin after deserting from 
the army. 
The soldier who is manning the Zigoyak 
when we arrive is a burly man. Like everyone 
else, he is bearded, but he has the additional 
distinguishing feature of tatooed dots across 
his face. He tells me that these are associated 
with his tribe -the Achakzais -in southern 
Qandahar Province. He is a friendly man, 
much friendlier than the mullah who had kept 
his cassette playing as we passed and stared 
vacantly at me as I took a photo of him. The 
Qandahari gunner is more affable and offers 
us tea in the Afghan refugee tent that stands 
off to the side of the gun emplacement. 
He has been away from his home for two 
years now, ever since he was press-ganged into 
the army. Six months ago, he escaped, and he 
has been in Zadran ever since. He doesn't like 
it here. The Zadrans, he insists, are vahshi: 
wild, savage. You can't trust them. They are 
Muslims by day and thieves by night. At the 
same time, however, he also tells me that he 
intends to stay where he is for awhile. A moun­
tain base like this one is relatively safe. Down 
in the plains, the government can capture you, 
and if they don't, you'll probably get killed by 
one of the parties. Perhaps one day this situa­
tion will change, but he will stay where he is 
for awhile. The roads are too unsafe to travel. 
The refugee camps in Pakistan are over­
crowded, the summers there unbearably hor, 
and the local officials always want bribes. 
Later in the day, I meet another ex-soldie r, 
a Persian-speaking Tajik from the Kohistan 
region just north of Kabul. He is a young man 
-not more than 22 or 23 -and boyishly hand­
some. Although he looks more like a teenager 
than a man, a man he must be since he served 
as a parachute commando in the army before 
deserting last year. Unlike most of the other 
mujahidin I have met, he has little time for 
Islam and openly admits to me that he had 
been a follower of a famous leftist guerrilla 
leader named Majid Kalakani who had been 
captured and killed by the government some 
years before. He talks proudly of his time with 
Kalakani and tells me of the American sniper rifle that he used to own. It had a scope on it, 
and once he killed four Soviet tankists as they 
drove in a convoy down the main road toward 
Kabul. The beauty of the American rifle, he 
says, is its small bullets and its silent action. 
This means that the tankist sitting in the turret 
could be quietly picked off while the tank was 
rumbling along the road. Only later did his 
comrades recognize that the man on top was 
dead, and by then the sniper was long gone. 
It is early afternoon as we talk. The young 
Kohistani is guarding a Communist prisoner 
who was captured a few weeks ago during a 
surprise ambush of a wedding party in the 
nearby town of Gardez. It is the rime of early 
afternoon prayers, and we are near the 
mosque. Several mullahs pass by, and each tells 
my companion in rough Persian to go to the 
mosque: "Namaz bokhan (Go pray)!'' To 
each, he smiles and replies that he is on duty 
and can't leave his post. He tells me that he is 
tired of it here. Tired of the mullahs, ttred of 
the tribes. In a month or so, he will leave 
Zadran and join Khalil, a Jamiat commander , 
whose base is in Kohistan. Things will be 
better there. He will be rid of these damn 
Pakhtuns and return to his own people. 
The nex't morning, I head east with my com­
panions. We are going back to Pakistan, and 
every hour or so, we pass another group of 
10 and 20 mujahidin who are on their way 
back inside the country. Most are from nearby 
and have only another day or so to travel. 
Some are from the far north and will be on the 
road for the next two or three weeks. All are 
well armed. Most have AK-47s, and almost 
every group has at least one rocket-propelled 
grenade launcher , a weapon particularly useful 
for ambushes along the road. It is spring, and 
another season of killing is about to begin. 
At the end of the second day, we near the 
base at Zhawar. It is our last stop before cross­
ing the border. The path takes us along a high 
ridge that skirts a broad plain. To the north is 
the garrison town of Khost, and in the distance 
we can see tall plumes of dust rise up from the 
ground. Tanks are headed toward us. An oper­
ation is going on. The government is trying ro 
retake a post about a mile ahead of us that the 
mujahidin had captured some weeks earlier. 
Overhead, a MiG appears. Small at first, it gets 
larger and larger as it approaches. I can see the 

350 DAVID B. EDWARDS 
bombs under its wings as it banks above us. 
The antiaircraft guns at Zhawar begin firing. 
The screaming of the jet is punctuated by the 
dull, jackhammer thud of the antia ircraft guns. 
I'm not sure, but I think I can hear an occa­
sional and distant "ting, ring, ring," as the 
shells ricochet off the armored belly of the jet. 
Ahead of us, off to the northeast, we can just 
make out Laizha, the base that is under attack, 
and we watch as the MiG levels off and 
releases its bombs. They twirl off the under­
carriage, pirouette for a moment, then brown 
clouds of dust billow up, and a few seconds 
later, we hear the dull concussion of metal 
smashing stone. I can't help myself from think­
ing: it's just like the movies. Then I get scared, 
but when I look at my companions they are 
grinning. One of them shouts to me, "Turn on 
your tape recorder!" I fumble the machine out 
of my bag and push the record button. "Isn't 
it dangerous where we are?" I ask. The older 
and more experienced of my companions 
looks at me. "Yes, very!" he says and laughs. 
Somehow this relaxes me. There is no place to 
go anyway; so I turn back to watch the MiG 
and listen again to the antiaircraft guns beating 
their rhythm against the sky. 
The Net 
Last fall, the computer center at my college 
hooked me up to Internet, one feature of which 
is a bulletin board consisting of over two thou­
sand news groups. I regularly monitor two 
of these two thousand groups: "Soc.Cul. 
Afghanistan" and "Soc. Religion .Islam,. The 
first of these news groups is a bulletin board 
where Afghans and those interested in things 
Afghan can post messages to each other, and 
the second is a bulletin board that attracts mes­
sages for and by Muslims generally about 
issues having to do with their religion. Anyone 
who wants to send a message out for others to 
read and comment on writes up what he or she 
wants to say and then posts it to the bulletin 
board where it is available for inspection and 
comment until whoever manages the bulletin 
board decides to dump the existing postings to 
make space for new messages. 
Those who contribute to Soc.Cul. 
Afghanistan and Soc.Religion.Islam are scat­
tered rather widely over the globe, but it is dif-ficult to know exactly how many people are 
out there, doing what I am, which is to say, 
reading other people's messages. I have to 
admit I am sometimes uncomfortable in this 
role, both because it feels rather like voyeurism 
and because it is strangely similar to anthro­
pology. After all, isn't reading other people's 
messages what we do for a living? OnJy, in this 
case, there doesn't have to be even a pretense 
of reciprocit y. I simply log on and click my 
mouse enough times to get me into the news 
group I want to monitor , and then I read. Since 
I sometimes go to my office early in the 
morning, I occasionally find myself staring at 
the screen in the twilight hours before dawn, 
which increases the sense that I am doing 
something illicit. 
Eventually , I will start posting my own mes­
sages, but I haven't yet. Those who regularly 
post resent people like me. We are "lurkers." 
In the news groups I monitor, lurking takes on 
a political complexion, and I have some­
times come across messages warning against 
"foreign spies" who are out to subvert Islam 
and Afghanistan. My intentions seem innocent 
enough, to me at least, but I know that I would 
be included in that category. Occasional ly, 
those who worry about foreign spies try to 
encode their messages, generally by transliter­
ating Persian in English script. Some have even 
worked out complicat ed ways of combining 
the available character set symbols into visual 
approximations of the Persian script, but these 
systems are cumbersome, and everyone always 
ends up back in English. 
I have only been monitoring these bulletin 
boards since November 1992; so I am not in 
a position to make great claims about what 
goes on these news groups. However , I have 
noticed certain persistent features that do 
stand out and are worth noting, such as the 
oft-expressed concern for "what kind of group 
we are going to be." One of the most charged 
issues related to this question has to do with 
who has the right to put their messages on 
the bulletin board, and I have encount ered 
frequent complaints by regular contributors 
when Iranians, Pakistanis, and what are 
referred to by some as "Islamic fundamental­
ists" post to the Afghan group. 
For many of the so-called fundamental ists, 
national boundaries are artificial distinctions, 
and they reflect this belief in their practice of 

AFGHAN ISTAN, ETHNOGRAPHY , AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER 351 
dispatching their computer messages to multi­
ple news groups on "the Net." Many Afghans 
resent these cross-postings, however , viewing 
them as violations of their communi ty's 
boundaries. In the opinion of these Afghans, 
the practice of cross-posting computer mes­
sages replicates the problem that Afghans face 
in real life, for just as Arabs, Iranians, and Pak­
istanis intrude upon their news group, so, over 
the past 15 years, have they repeatedly inter­
fered in Afghanistan' s internal affairs. 
Beyond this problem of who has the right to 
participate in the discourse of the news group, 
there are many other issues that come up on 
the Net that reflect the contemporary concerns 
not just of Afghans, but of Muslims more gen­
erally. Questions of this sort that I have 
noticed have included the following: 
-Is it permissible to get married over the 
phone, and if so, how do the mullah and wit­
nesses perform their roles? 
-Does contemporary genetic science indi­
cate that marriage to your first cousin increases 
risks of birth defects? 
-What does Islam say about oral sex? 
-Are there stipulations in Islam against 
investing in mutual funds and other current 
financial instruments? 
-Should the beginning and end of the 
month of fasting be decided according to sci­
entific measures now available, or by local 
observation, or by the calculations of Saudi 
officials in Mecca? 
Although most of these issues are particular 
to the better-off immigrants coping with the 
modem diaspora, there are nevertheless strik­
ing similarities between these questions and 
those that arose in the mud-walled refugee 
camp where I worked. The refugee camp, like 
the Net, is an unprecedented place to be 
working out issues of identity and communit y, 
and consequently there are many matters that 
had previously been unproblematic that have 
come to take on major significance in the 
context of the camp. Should one arrange mar­
riages with kinsmen who might be far away or 
with current neighbors from the camp? How 
are weddings to be celebrated in a rime of 
jihad? Can people play music on their tape 
recorders? Who decides guilt and punishment 
when someone gets injured in a fight or acci­
dent? Who will contribute when the mosque roof gets washed out by winter rains? Since 
most people have to leave their compounds to 
defecate and there are so many people in camp, 
how is it going to be possible for women to go 
about their business without compromising 
purdah? 
The problems that arise on the Net are obvi­
ously not the same as these questions, but there 
are still certain shared features. In both con­
texts, the usual diacritica of identity have been 
subjected to pressure and dislocation. In both 
places, strangers have come together out of 
common need and have been forced by cir­
cumstance to share an unaccustomed space in 
such a way that all can get along. To deal with 
this situation, new modes of communication 
and compromise have been developed, and in 
both contexts Islam has been critical to the 
effort. 
When I lived in Afghanistan before the civil 
war, it was always my impression that Muslim 
identity was simply a fact of life and not a 
subject of contestation. The great majority of 
men (at least) went to the mosque, prayed, and 
-for the most part -seemed to accept the 
obligations imposed on them by religion as 
givens. Now, however , in contexts in which 
there are no givens, in which the most basic 
circumstances of everyday life are subject to 
flux and uncertainty, Islam has become the 
primary focus of concern. Although Islam roo 
is subject to novel pressures, it appears to 
many people more stable than anything else 
around them. In a sea of uncertain choices, 
Islam is a life-ring that they can hang on to. 
But, of course, holding the rope at the other 
end are the political parries. 
The belief of many Afghans that the politi­
cal parties are manipulating Islam for their 
own purposes lends a strident political tone to 
almost every debate that takes place both on 
the Net and in the camp. However innocently 
a discussion begins, it always ends up 
enmeshed in politics. One example that comes 
to mind involves an American high school 
student who posted a message on the bulletin 
board asking for assistance with a homework 
assignment he was working on. The student 
seemed to want a thumbnail sketch of Afghan 
culture and history-presumably one he could 
copy directly into whatever social studies 
paper he was writing. However� what he actu-

352 DAVID B. EDWARDS 
ally got -whether he realized it or not -was 
much more revealing, for the posters who 
responded soon forgot about the student's 
inquiry and launched into a set of diatribes 
for and against the various Afghan political 
parties. Since the practice of the Net is for each 
poster to post his or her message interlinearly 
within that of the preceding poster, what one 
saw in following this debate was the gradual 
erosion of discourse as each new response was 
laid down on top of the previous one and the 
text as a whole became progress ively more 
shrill, garbled, and incoherent. 
The deterioration of discourse that one 
encounters graphically on the Net rather accu­
rately approximates the general fracturing 
of Afghan society - inside and outside 
Afghanistan' s borders- after more than fifteen 
years of war. At the same time, however , there 
are differences between the kinds of deteriora­
tion one finds inside Afghanistan or in the. 
camps and in the further-flung diaspora of the 
Net. The bombs that I heard at a distance in 
Paktia were aimed at real people, and they did 
not discriminate whether those they struck 
were mujahidin or children. Likewise, when 
refugees crammed side by side in their squalid 
compounds were unable to resolve their dis­
putes and the few avenues of mediation avail­
able to them proved unworkable, they usually 
ended up seeking redress in the old-fashioned 
way. Only now, the instruments and protocols 
for seeking redress have changed. Automatic 
weapons are plentiful, and so too are silent, 
stealthy paybacks: bombs tossed into com­
pounds, the use of hired gunmen to conceal 
responsibil ity, and the proliferation of street­
corner kidnappin gs. 
Debates on the Net sometimes aspire, in 
their rhetorical way, to the level of violence 
that exists "on the ground," but the fact that 
these debates have been adapted to the ether 
space of the computer distinguishes them both 
in their practice and in their outcome. In the 
camp, a dispute, whether engendered by a per­
sonal feud or an ideological disagreement, will 
often lead to bitterness and killing, but in ether 
space words that elsewher e provoke violence 
are articulated through glyphs and cursors, 
and no one gets hurt. Violence remains finally 
in the minds of the beholders, and the escala­
tion of harms and consequen ces that develops in the course of a normal feud never takes 
place because of the faceless quality of com­
munication on the Net. 
The image that comes to mind when I think 
about this new technology is the old technol­
ogy of the panopticon. The new reverses the 
old, however, for with the new technology one 
does not have a central contr olling observer 
looking into each of the cells located on the 
outer ring of the circle. Rather, one finds that 
the panopticon has been inverted so that all of 
the inmates are now allowed to look inward 
toward the central, illuminated space of the 
Net. In this space, posters dream their dreams, 
vent their rage, and assume their roles. The 
antagonisms can be vicious here, but no one 
really knows who it is they are striking. No 
one suffers the consequences of their anger, 
and it is all ultimately rather futile. People have 
often noted the proliferation of simulated sex 
in the era of AlDS, but the Net reveals to us 
that there is also a kind of simulated politics 
in the age of the global diaspora. 
DC 
It is a Sunday in April 1991, and I am at a flea 
market in Georgetown. I have come to Wash­
ington, DC, to visit Shah Mahmood, my old 
research assistant who is now a political 
refugee in the States, and to interview a famous 
mujahidin commander who is staying with 
him. The day before we had conducted our 
interview, and today we are trying to sell a 
shipment of rugs that has been sent to Shah 
Mahmood by a friend in Pakistan. Every 
Sunday for the last few months, Shah 
Mahmood has been taking the rugs to the 
Sunday morning flea market in Georgetown 
where he hawks his wares. We are accompa­
nied this day by the commander and another 
Afghan who shares Shah Mahmood's apart­
ment in Northern Virginia. Unlike Shah 
Mahmood, this man is an illegal alien who has 
no papers and few prospects for attaining 
political asylum. 
While we are at the flea market, an Afghan 
comes up to Shah Mahmood and the com­
mander, and they embrace and chat for awhile. 
The man is rather chubby and wears an expen­
sive leather coat and a rayon shirt, open at the 

AFGHAN ISTAN, ETHNOGRAPHY , AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER 353 
neck. Next to Shah Mahmood, who is wearing 
khaki pants and a cotton sport shirt, and the 
commander , who wears a dark suit and white 
shirt, the man looks rather flashy, and his car­
riage is that of someone with a roll of bills in 
his pocket. The talk is friendly but stiff. After 
he leaves, Shah Mahmood tells me that this 
man is from the Surkh Rud district of 
Afghanistan, not far from where the comman­
der lives. The commander is from the tribal 
areas in the mountains. This man is from the 
neighboring plains. His family is very wealthy, 
and for a long time they have had a variety of 
business ventures going on in Afghanistan and 
Pakistan. Now, they have come to the States 
and have managed to take control of a large 
percentage of the hot-dog carts operating in 
rhe capital district. 
One of the secrets of their success, accord­
ing to Shah Mahmood, is that they are able to 
hire other Afghans to operate the pushcarrs at 
low salaries. Most of those they hire have 
recently arrived in the country, and many -like 
Shah Mahmood's roommate -are illegals. 
Shah Mahmood himself owned a carr for 
awhile, but not for long. Those with papers 
usually look elsewhere for work since the 
pushcart business doesn't pay well, requires 
long hours, and is thought of as rather 
demeaning. The job of choice for most 
refugees is driving a taxi. That's considered the 
best, even though it is also difficult work and 
requires long hours if the driver is going to 
cover expenses and make any money. But, at 
least when you're driving a taxi, you're your 
own man. For Afghans, that's important. 
Apparently , the businessman has been trying 
to see the commander for some time; so his 
visit to the flea market is not coincidenta l. The 
commander is famous, and the businessman 
wants to show his respect. The businessman 
may have commercial interests in the States 
now, but his base of operations is still the 
Afghan-Pakistan frontier. He knows that the 
commander is a man of influence back home 
and may be even more important in the future; 
so he has reason to want to cultivate their rela­
tionship. Before leaving, he has invited us to 
his home for dinner. We will go there after fin­
ishing up with the carpets. 
The businessma n's apartment is in a high­
rise complex that Shah Mahmood says is called the "Watergate of the Pentagon." The 
complex looms over us as we approach, and 
the fact that we must pass through a security 
gate lets us know that we are going someplace 
very different from the dingy, low-rent apart­
ment where Shah Mahmood currently resides. 
We park and enter one of the rowers. A shiny 
elevator deposits us before tall mirrors on a 
long, carpeted corridor with threadbare pre­
tensions to elegance. The hallway door opens 
to reveal a modern apartment unit: wall-to­
wall carpeting, matching sofas upholstered in 
sleek black Naugahyde, a sliding door and 
balcony looking out over the exurban land­
scape of Northern Virginia. Straight ahead is 
the television and VCR in a black Plexiglas 
console. Around the corner to the right, I can 
make our a dining room table. In the same 
direction, I hear kitchen sounds -water 
running in a sink, dishes rattling-and also the 
high-pitched sound of small children playing 
and the hushed voice of a woman who remains 
unseen. 
There are four men present when we arrive. 
We all greet, and then the men form a single 
line for prayers, facing the sltding glass door. 
Ir is an awkward space for this activity, and 
bodies inadvertently touch and josrle as the 
men kneel and rise and kneel again. It is the 
month of fasting; so, as soon as prayers are fin­
ished, all of the men immediately break fast 
with the sickly sweet juice that is favored for 
this occasion. Then, we are invited to ear. But 
nor at the dining room table, which remains 
unused. Rather, we sit on the floor around a 
plastic sheet that has been placed between the 
sofas in the Living room. It is a cramped space, 
but the food is good and abundant, and it is 
gone within minutes. 
After the meal, the man we met at the flea 
marker and his younger brother clear the 
dishes while the elder brother, who is around 
45 or 50, sirs in an armchair smoking a ciga­
rette. Throughout the evening the younger 
brothers defer to this man, fetching matches, 
offering rea and sweets to the guests, and oth­
erwise performing the standard services 
expected of younger brothers. Most of the con­
versation goes back and forth between the 
elder brother and the command er. The com­
mander's opinion on the political situation is 
solicited, and he tells stories I have heard 

354 DAVID 8. EDWARDS 
before about the fighting, the assassination 
attempts made against him, his wounds. There 
is a sense of resignation in the room. How 
many times have such stories been told? How 
many rimes have all of these people expressed 
the same opinions about the leaders and the 
parties? Their country is sunk in a quagmire, 
and no one has any idea how it might end. But, 
they are also not waiting to find out. The 
Surkh Rudis have their business and their 
green cards. They don't know it, but the com­
mander has applied for his as well. I have 
promised to write a letter for him to INS. So 
have other Americans that the commander has 
met during his stay. He doesn't want to move 
here just yet, but everyone is trying to keep as 
many options open as possible. No one wants 
to be stuck in Pakistan for the rest of their 
lives. 
After an hour or so, the conversation flags, 
and our host suggests that we watch a video­
tape made of his younger brother's wedding 
that was held in Peshawar the year before. The 
VCR is turned on, and all tum to watch as a 
static image of the Surkh Rudi businessman 
comes on the screen. This time, he is dressed 
in traditional Pakhtun clothing and wears 
around his neck a gaudy tinsel garland that 
droops almost to the floor. He is flanked by a 
number of other men in similar dress, and 
every minute or so someone new comes up to 
him. He rises, and they embrace. Some of the 
greeters carry garlands of the sort the bride­
groom already has around his neck. These gar­
lands are covered in rupee notes, and each 
greeter places his around the bridegroom' s 
neck. There the garlands remain for a few 
seconds before a servant comes forward to 
take the topmost ones away. 
The tape, it appears, will go on for hours. 
Occasionally , the camera pans over the room, 
but mostly it focuses on the bridegroom rising 
to greet his guests. There is nothing joyous or 
celebratory in any of this. None of those who 
greet the bridegroom look him in the eye or 
even smile. There are no jokes. No frivolity. It 
is entirely mechanical, and the camera has 
exposed that quality more vividly for me than 
reality ever managed to do. Strangely, it almost 
seems that there is more intimacy and liveli­
ness in our gathering than at the wedding 
depicted on the screen, for while the guests on screen are mostly mute and expression less, 
our hosts eagerly provide names, background 
information, and short anecdotes for virtually 
every guest who greets the bridegroom. This 
number includes prominent Afghans and Pak­
istanis. Some are older tribal chiefs dressed in 
traditional garb; others are sleek young sophis­
ticates. All seem to be men of influence and 
power, and it is abundantly clear both that this 
family has a lot of important contacts and that 
they are extremely proud of this fact. 
Most of the names that are mentioned mean 
little to me, however, and my attention begins 
to wander until I suddenly notice a lull in the 
conversation. A new face has appeared on the 
screen to greet the bridegroom, but for the first 
time our hosts have remained silent. No one 
says anything, and there is a palpable feeling 
of embarrassment that even I can sense despite 
my unfamiliarity with most of the personali­
ties on the screen and my general obliviousness 
to the subtleties of the cultural performance 
1 am witnessing. The tape continues, but the 
enthusiasm has dimmed. After a few minutes, 
Shah Mahmood begins to fidget and says 
something about my having to catch a train 
early in the morning. The intrusion is not 
unwelcome. The tape is turned off, and every­
one stands, chatting and waiting for the appro­
priate moment to head toward the door. 
The man we met at the flea market breaks 
off from the group and then a few minutes 
later brings his young son out from one of the 
bedrooms. He is a proud father, and the sight 
of the small boy reanimates the conversation. 
It occurs to me that it is very late for a child 
this age to be up, and then I realize that while 
we have been in the apartment, the domestic 
life of the family has been frozen. At least one 
woman has been in the kitchen the whole 
evening. Others (whose voices I have occa­
sionally heard, usually scolding children) have 
been confined to the back bedrooms. Children 
have moved about, but the women, obedient 
to the laws of a distant homeland, have not. 
Custom and the configuration of the apart­
ment have thus conspired to make their lives 
quite miserable, at least for this evening, and 
I'm sure there have been many others not 
unlike this one. 
We embrace and say good-bye to our hosts 
at the door, but the middle brother, the one we 

AFGHANIS TAN, ETHNOGRAPHY , AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER 355 
first met that afternoon at the flea market, 
insists against our objections on escorting us 
downstairs. Again, there are embraces, and 
then Shah Mahmood gets behind the wheel 
of his car, a '76 Chevy Caprice Classic. Shah 
Mahmood' s roommate, the illegal who oper­
ates the hot-dog cart, sits beside him, and the 
commander and I sit in the rear. As we make 
our way back through the maze of highways 
and strip malls, we talk about the gathering, 
and as usual, I go over all of the events and 
points of discussion that were unclear to me 
during the course of the evening. One thing 
that immediately comes to mind is the 
unnamed man in the videotape, and I ask why 
it was that everyone had stopped talking when 
he appeared. 
The commander laughs and tells me that the 
man who had come on the screen was a well­
known Communist from Surkh Rud and that 
he had been in a group of government security 
officers that the commander had captured in a 
big operation a few years ago. There had been 
over seventy men in the group, and the com­
mander had tricked them into an ambush. 
Almost all of them had been executed, but he 
had allowed this man to be released because 
he came from a "good" family. He himself was 
no good, of course, but his people were 
"pure"; so he let him go. Sometime later, the 
man had crossed the border and become a 
refugee in Pakistan. Now, he's doing business 
again. There is no outrage, or even disap­
proval, in the commander's voice when he tells 
me this, and he goes on to explain that the 
man's story is in no way unusual. Lots of 
refugees used to be Communists, he says, 
including many who now present themselves 
as pious Muslims. Before, they carried red 
banners through the streets of Kabul. Now, 
they wear beards and say their prayers five 
times a day. That's the kind of war this is. It's 
just that kind of war. 
Orientations 
In this essay, I have brought together incidents 
whose only apparent connection to one 
another is that they all involve Afghans as 
actors and me as witness to their actions. Why 
these particular moments? Why not others? I cannot say for certain. However, as I was 
mulling over what I should write about on 
the subject of "multiply-inflected cultural 
objects," these episodes struck me as somehow 
telling, and one reason for this is certainly that 
they all involve people who are not where they 
are supposed to be (or at least where they used 
to be). Whether it is the many mujahidin who 
have found their way to the mountains of 
Paktia from diverse regions of Afghanistan, 
or the graduate students on the Net at their 
various campuses, or the jihad commander in 
the high-rise apartment in Virginia, one thread 
running through each of these narratives is the 
common condition of coping in foreign places 
with unfamiliar people. 
Another recurrent theme in these vignenes 
has to do with technology and the way in 
which technology mediates and transforms 
social and political relations. In Paktia, tech­
nology was represented principally by the 
multiple instruments of killing that were every­
where to be seen, but there were other sorts of 
technology present as well, such as the mini­
tape recorder that helped to define my other­
wise elusive identity to those I met and the 
portable radio/tape player that one of the 
gunners had beside him that allowed him to 
listen to recitations of the Qur'an, alongside 
broadcasts from Radio Moscow, the VOA, 
and the BBC. In the Net, we confront a revo­
lutionary apparatus that makes possible inter­
active, unmediat ed communications between 
perfect strangers from around the globe; but, 
more dumbfounding than the wizardry of the 
technology itself is the speed with which the 
recombinant forms of a postmodern, postna­
tional communicative medium have been har­
nessed to the ancient wagons of feud and 
faction. In the story of the jihad commander 
in Northern Virginia, we encounter the 
blankly staring presence of the videocassette 
recorder. Perhaps the most ubiquitous of all 
new technologies, the VCR has begun w rad­
ically reorder the protocols by which identity 
and community are imagined and managed in 
an increasingly scattered and globally decen­
tered world. 
Each of these themes can be seen in the 
stories I have told, but I want to reiterate a dec­
laration made at the beginning of this essay, 
which is that my primary object in bringing 

356 DAVID B. EDWARDS 
these stories together is not to provide graphic 
illustrations for a particular theory or point of 
view. The choice of which stories to include 
here has been arrived at intuitively rather than 
analytically and has not been guided by any 
particular proposition. To the contrary, I 
simply wa.nted to write up accounts of several 
remembered incidents from the not-too-distant 
past, and along the way, I also decided to 
include a brief excursus into a current fascina­
tion -the Net -that seemed somehow to fit 
with the rest. As I read them now, what the 
memories I have included and the discussion 
of the Net all seem to share, to my mind at 
least, has less to do with definable issues like 
migration, dislocation, and technology, than 
with an essential ambiguity and estrangement 
that I discern in each. That, I suppose, is why 
they never got included in anything I had 
written before and why I wanted to put them 
together here -to make some sense of what . 
was to me their abiding strangeness. 
The trip to Paktia, for example, illustrates 
several obvious themes - the dislocation and 
realignment of ethnic groups in a time of war, 
the unanticipated role of the political party as 
safe haven in response to general upheaval -
but it also seems to me to contain a more enig­
matic quality, as well, that is less easy to 
specify. I don't know if that quality has to do 
with the place itself or if it derives from my 
perception of it, for my memories of the events 
described have a timeless, floating quality to 
them that seems to increase with distance. The 
experience of war, like that of a natural disas­
ter or of more mundane births and deaths, 
rests outside of ordinary time. And while these 
experiences can be hellish, they are also 
intensely memorable, though in ways that 
sometimes distort what actually happened. In 
moments of stress and uncertainty, time itself 
gets stretched in awkward directions, and 
when they are recalled as memory , the experi­
enced events are sometimes darkly com­
pressed, and other times bathed in a saturated, 
unnatural sort of light. 
Should these qualities of perception and dis­
tortion be suppressed, or should we seek to 
reflect them in the texts we write? My answer 
is obviously that they constitute an important 
part of our experience, even if we do not know 
at first what they might signjfy. In this essay, I have tried to convey a sense of the tactile, if 
sometimes contorted, immediacy of remem­
bered experience by using the first-person and 
the present tense. The present tense, in partic­
ular, is scorned these days as reminiscent of an 
older style of anthropological writing in which 
the author bolstered the authenticity of the fin­
ished account, along with his/her own author­
ity, by constructing a false facade of realistic, 
"l-am-the-camera" details. The critique was a 
valid one, but the present tense remains a 
useful tool for representing the lived­
experience of fieldwork -especially the 
contingent quality of events as they are appre­
hended on the run. 
Although I understand them better now for 
having written them down and placed them 
together, the episodes and situations described 
here contain other ambiguities, as well, beyond 
those derived from the deformities of percep­
tion and memory. I have no idea, for instance, 
who my friend the commander really is or 
which of the things I heard from him are true. 
Nor can I say with any certainty what sort of 
negonattons were being transacted that 
everung in the Surkh Rudis' apartment or how 
deep was the play. I also can't say for sure what 
was going on up in the mountains of Paktia. 
Men from all parts of Afghanistan had been 
thrown together. That much I know, but what 
kind of place was it? Was it the forward 
outpost of a group of committed Muslim war­
riors-the kind so feared today in the West­
or was it more like a small boat seeking a calm 
anchorage during a very rough night of 
storms? In the case of the Net, a different sort 
of uncertainty is present, an uncertainty and a 
sadness, for it seems to me that obscured 
beneath the tumult of scrolled postings and the 
blinking cacophony of interlaced diatribes is 
a silence that surrounds every individual who 
logs on. Underlying the diverse communit ies of 
interest that the Net makes possible is the 
specter of solitude -the loneliness of the dark­
ened cell and the humming quiet of the illu­
minated screen. 
We all want simple truths. We want myster­
ies that give way to our probings. We want 
situations that yield to analysis. We want 
tried-and-true concepts to mean what they 
always have and the assurance that design and 
method can ultimately win out over random-

AFGHAN ISTAN, ETHNOGRAPHY , AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER 357 
ness and entropy. And maybe more than any­
thing, we want stories that have clear morals, 
heroes, and villains who are what they appear 
to be, and endings that finally end. If recent 
events tell us anything, however, it is that such 
illusions are vain. The announcement of a new 
world order and of history's death was pre­
mature, and we have come to understand that 
whatever transient order had existed in world 
affairs was largely the result of the unnatural 
constraints that had been imposed upon them 
by superpower rivalry. 
Ethnographers and ethnographic writing 
cannot change these facts, but they should at 
least strive to reflect them and resist the urge 
ro impose an overarching order when such 
order is not what is most apparent. One impli­
cation of this assertion is that, just as anthro­
pologists provide a space in their texts for 
analysis and interpretation, so should they 
leave room for strangeness and uncertainty 
and the stuff that troubles understanding. As 
they enlist theories and explanat ory models to 
specific ends, so should they make it clear that 
their scope is finite and that at least some of 
the symmetries they perceive are produced by 
the theoretical lenses they choose to wear. 
In coming to grips with the intercon nected 
worlds we inhabit and chronicle, we must also 
think very carefully about the methodological 
practices we keep and the rhetorical ways in 
which we conceive and fashion the "data, of 
our research. Despite our best efforts to be 
truthful, traditional modes of organization and 
articulation can and often do lend to what we 
construe as "our research objects" a formal 
logic and coherence that bears little or no rela­
tionship to our original experience of those 
objects. 
Recognizing this fact, I have tried to explore 
in this paper new ways of organizing and artic­
ulating my accounts of the people and places 
I study. What I have come up with is a more 
improvisational or aleatoric style of writing, 
the goal of which has been to convey a sense 
of the scattered and disjointed contexts in 
which I have conducted field research. In the 
process of putting together this text, however, 
I have also been faced with the fact that, 
however far-flung they might be, the social 
worlds I study nevertheless reveal between 
themselves certain patterns and processes despite the disjunctions and dislocations to 
which they are subject. While I have tried to 
see my fieldwork as experience rather than 
data collection and to avoid imposing an 
extraneous order upon the events I have wit­
nessed, a certain kind of order has emerged 
nonetheless. Is it an order that resides out 
there, or has my anthropological training so 
conditioned me to see the world in certain 
ways that my own perception has become an 
extension of the disciplin e's priorities? I can't 
answer this question with any confidence, but 
I hope that I can at least contribute to the real­
ization that such questions matter and to the 
experimentation that will be required for 
anthropologists to capture the sense and sig­
nificance of the multiply-inf lected, multiply­
conflicted global cultures they presently 
confront. 
Peshawar 
Since I have stated a commitment to experi­
ence over theory and to ambiguity over cer­
tainty, I will conclude by recounting a final 
episode that (like so many stories coming out 
of a war zone) has the shadow of violence 
upon it. The incident took place one after­
noon, not long before I left Peshawar , when an 
Afghan friend drove up to my house in a 
Suzuki pickup. He worked for one of the relief 
organizations, and he'd told me before that 
he'd be coming by. He had a passenger with 
him, a man of about 45, I would have guessed, 
but his grizzled beard made it difficult to guess 
his age with any precision. My friend had to 
help him get out because his eyes could no 
longer see. We sat down inside, and he told me 
his story, what there was to tell. 
He'd been a village mulla before the war. 
For the last six years, he had been leading the 
life of a mujahed, living in the mountains, 
laying ambushes, leading prayers, traveling 
back and forth to Pakistan for supplies. One 
day, he was walking along a path and spied a 
book lying on the ground nearby. From the 
cover, he could tell it was a copy of the Qur'an. 
Normally , Afghans cover their Qur'ans with 
cloth and keep them in special niches in 
the walls of their homes. This one was soiled 
and abandoned. He opened it, and a bomb 

358 DAVID B. EDWARDS 
concealed within exploded in his face. That's 
why he'd been brought to me. My friend knew 
that I had a Pakistani friend who was a doctor. 
I'd called him, and my doctor friend had rec­
ommended a specialist with whom I made an 
appointment. 
The man we went to see was about my age 
at the time. Early thirties. He'd gotten his 
medical education at Khyber Medical College 
in Peshawar and then went on to receive 
advanced training in eye surgery in London. 
The examination was brief. He shined a light 
into the muUa 's eyes, peered through an instru­
ment into each of the two scarred orbs, and 
then signaled me to come with him back to his 
office. There was nothing that could be done. 
Both eyes were destroyed. He shook his head. 
I can't remember exactly what he said, but it 
was something about the savagery of tribal 
people. It is difficult for us to understand them 
or their violence; he told me. They're just 
different from you and me, and by way of 
elaboration, he pulled out a handful of pho­
tographs. They showed a woman in traditional 
tribal dress. She looked like other Pakhtun 
women I had seen, except that her face was 
horribly disfigured. The doctor explained that her husband had 
slashed her repeatedly with a knife for some 
perceived indiscretion. She probably should 
have died, her wounds were so severe, but 
some relatives had managed to get her out of 
the house and had taken her to the hospitaL 
That's where the doctor had seen her. Because 
she had been cut around her eyes, as well as 
on other pans of her face, he had examined 
her, and later, when she was recovering and the 
scars were healing, he had taken these snap­
shots. As I looked at the photographs, he 
looked at me and smiled a dry, wry sort of 
smile. It was not a smile of amusement, but of 
identification. From the doctor's surname, I 
knew that he was himself a Pakhtun. His 
people had once been tribal people, and even 
now, he might have women in his own 
extended family who looked and dressed very 
much like the woman in the pictures. But now 
he was an educated man like myself, and these 
photographs seemed in some sad, horrible 
way to join us together, in testament to our 
common bond, our common civilization, and 
our common difference.
