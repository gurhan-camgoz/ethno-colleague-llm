Ethnog raphic Seduction, 
Transference, and Resistance 
in Dialogues about Terror and 
Violence in Argentina 
Antonius C. G. M. Robben 
Anthropology has witnessed in recent years a 
growing interest in the study of violence. Most 
of these studies derive their research date from 
interviews with victims traumatized by vio­
lence, not from the direct observation of the 
violence itself.1 What is the influence of the 
violence to which the informants have been 
exposed on their relationships with ethnogra­
phers, and what methodological adjustments 
should researchers make in these emotionally 
charged encounters? How are anthropologists 
themselves affected by listening to accounts of 
traumatizing events? How may their reactions 
interfere with the gathering of research data, 
and, finally, what can be done to recognize and 
cope with such reactions? 
In this article I shall indicate the relevance 
of psychoanalytic practice to these issues 
through a discussion of the interview problems 
with victims and perpetrators of violence 
during more than two years of fieldwork on 
the contested historical reconstruction of the 
so-called dirty war in Argentina. I will focus 
on the complex social and transferential rela­
tionship with my interviewees, and delineate in which ways they tried to influence my under­
standing of the political violence of the 1960s 
and 1970s. 
Anthropologists can learn much from psy­
choanalysts on how to interact with victims of 
violence, torture, and terror. For instance, the 
treatment of Jewish holocaust survivors has 
shown that analysts should initially refrain 
from the common practice of probing for any 
deeper meanings hidden in the manifest dis­
course. The analyst should begin the therapeu­
tic relationship by accepting at face value 
whatever is told about life in the concentration 
camps and, in some cases, even fill in the gaps. 
Victims of extreme violence have often lost all 
trust in other human beings, and their accounts 
have met with disbelief. They have to be con­
vinced that their analyst believes them, and that 
he or she can endure the pain their accounts 
evoke, before they will enter into an intensive 
working alliance. Ethnographers who inter­
view victims and perpetrators of violence will 
encounter similar perusals of credibili ty and 
trust, and will also need to adapt their research 
practices to such unusual circumstances.

Anthropologists can also benefit from the 
psychoanalytic understanding of transferential 
phenomena in emotionally charged encoun­
ters. Much has been written in psychological 
anthropology about the problems of transfer­
ence and countertransference in the relation­
ship between ethnographers and informants, 
and calls for a heightened psychological reflex­
ivity about data gathering and even prepara­
tory therapy before entering the field continue 
to be made (Crapanzano 1994:236-42; 
Luhrmann 1994:74-7). In this article I want 
to elaborate on these interactional and trans­
ferential problems by drawing attention to 
ethnographic seduction as a complex dynamic 
of conscious moves and unconscious defenses 
that may arise in interviews with victims and 
perpetrators of violence. I use the term seduc­
tion to denote ways in which interviewees 
influence the understa nding and research 
results of their interviewers. This seduction. is 
carried out most effectively, but not exclu­
sively, by way of the ethnographer's uncon­
scious countertransferential reactions. 
Seduction prevents interviewers from probing 
the discourse of the interviewee and, instead, 
makes them lose their critical stance toward 
the manifest discourse. George Devereux 
(1967:44-5} has also used the term seduction 
in his discussion of countertransference among 
anthropologists. However , he only refers to an 
unconscious emotional attraction, while I have 
extended the concept to the conscious utiliza­
tion of the complex social, emotional, dialogic, 
and transferential dynamic between ethnogra­
pher and informant. 
I first became aware of the importance of 
this dynamic through the elaborate display of 
caballerosidad (gentlemanlikeness} and the 
barrage· of kindness and courtesy bestowed on 
me by several Argentine generals. I soon iden­
tified this attention as seducci6n and began to 
recognize it also in my meetings with clergy­
men, human rights activists, and former guer­
rilleros. The word seducci6n is often used by 
Argentines to describe the political practice of 
charming, captivating, persuading, encourag­
ing, misleading, and corrupting people.2 The 
term arose frequently during my fieldwork in 
Argentina. It was couched in comments such 
as "The book by Giussani is seductive"; "Be 
careful in your interview with Admiral Rojas because he can be very seductive"; "President 
Menem is a seductive politician"; and "The 
documentary La Republ ica Perdida [The Lost 
Republic] was a seductive propaganda film for 
Alfonsin's political campaign ." These remarks 
were intended to warn me about the dangers 
of being absorbed by the rhetoric argument, 
the distorted discourse, and the visual manip­
ulation by interpreters and protagonists of 
political events. A seduced audience is, after 
all, a captive audience. As a captive audience, 
I might not realize that the accounts of my 
interlocutors were slanted, partisan, and polit­
ically motivated. 
I have decided to retain the term seduction 
as descriptive of the interview dynamic dis­
cussed here, not only in continuation of its 
Argentine meaning, but also because seduction 
means literally "to be led astray from an 
intended course." Other terms, such as decep­
tion or allurement, carry negative overtones 
that suggest dishonesty and malintent, while 
the dramaturgical term impression manage­
ment fails to take account of unconscious 
countertransferential reactions. 
A disadvantage of the term is that it risks an 
association with Freud's seduction theory. My 
use of seduction stands clear from Freud's 
theory about hysteria and from any implied 
commonsense connotations with sexual desire, 
allurement, and entrapment. I am aware of the 
sexual overtones of the wprd seduction in 
English colloquial speech, but these overtones 
are far less prominent in Spanish. Further­
more, the term is comparable to other words 
that in certain contexts have sexual connota­
tions, such as satisfaction, excitation, penetra­
tion, stimulation, and scoring. However , these 
partial meanings do not deter us from using 
them in their etymologically neutral sense. 
Finally, I recognize the risks of using seduc­
tion in the context of violence. The association 
of the words victim and seduction makes me 
vulnerable to the unwanted charge that I 
somehow imply the victim brought upon 
himself or herself the pain that was inflicted, 
while the mere proposition that victims of vio­
lence might mold what they tell us could con­
tribute to their victimization and, ultimate ly, 
might cast a shadow on my moral standards. 
How can I question the horror stories I have 
been told? We can easily imagine being given 

TERROR AND VIOLENCE IN ARGENTINA 161 
half-truths by torturers and have sympathy for 
a critical stance toward their masters, but we 
raise our eyebrows at probing into the words 
of their victims. I have the same sympathies 
and reservat ions. However, as the psychoana­
lytic treatment of victims of violence has 
shown, people may repress and sublimate trau­
matic experiences. If done responsibly and 
with the highest ethical care, we should not shy 
away from reaching into the depths of human 
suffering. 
Much has been written about the cultural 
presuppositions and blind spots of anthropol­
ogists that may skew their observations, and 
we are also conscious of the impression man­
agement, mistrust, deceit, exaggeration, back­
stage defenses, and even disinformation by 
informants who try to shield sensitive knowl­
edge from the inquisitive fieldworker. Such 
circumventions are generally regarded as 
obstructing rather than contributing to a 
greater ethnographic understanding. Anthro­
pology simply lacks a theory of concealment 
that transforms these obstructions into a 
deeper cultural insight. Psychoanalysis, on the 
other hand, has placed concealment at the 
center of its theory and method. Its interpre­
tation of how analysands try to avoid dis­
cussing their traumas is instructive to 
anthropology. Close attention to the ways in 
which informants may use psychological 
processes to lead unaware ethnographers away 
from certain areas of knowledge may therefore 
contribute to greater ethnographic insight and 
improve anthropological research. 
There is an additional problem with 
accounts of violence. Traumatic experiences 
can only reach us through the distortion of 
words. As Young has said about our under­
standing of the Jewish holocaust: 
What is remembered of the Holocaust 
depends on how it is remembered, and how 
events are remembered depends in turn on the 
texts now giving them form .... This is not to 
question the ultimate veracity in any given 
account, but it is to propose a search for the 
truth in the interpretation intrinsic to all ver­
sions of the Holocaust: both that interpreta ­
tion which the writer consciously effects and 
that which his narrative necessarily accom­
plishes for him. (1988:1-2) Moreover , these traumatic experiences are 
related in a dialogue between victim and 
ethnographer whose proper dynamic influ­
ences their rendition. This encounter should be 
built on empathy, trust, and openness, without 
forgetting that the oral account is a discursive 
and interactional edifice of meaning that 
inevitably fails to do justice to the emotions 
and experiences of the narrator. If we do not 
acknowledge that we can only understand 
torture and abuse through the inadequacies of 
language, and if we furthermore shirk away 
from our own psychological reactions to their 
description and do not examine the social 
dynamic between us and our informants, then 
we may unwillingly harm these victims by 
simply reproducing their accounts as told. 
Although it will become dear in this article 
that I have drawn extensively on the profes­
sional experiences of psychoanalysts who have 
worked with victims of violence, there are two 
important differences that deserve mentioning. 
First of all, psychoanalysts are called upon to 
relieve suffering. Ethnographers, on the other 
hand, approach people to evoke their traumas 
but can do nothing to lessen the pain that 
ensues from reliving them. I must confess that 
this burden was sometimes a heavy load to 
carry during my research in Argentina, now 
and then provoked feelings of guilt, and made 
me decide more than once not to ask any 
further about certain traumatic experiences. 
A second difference between psychoanalysis 
and ethnographic research is that psychoana­
lysts and their analysands work under strict 
confidentia lity, while ethnographers are 
expected to report their findings. My research 
in Argentina had the complicating factor that 
it consisted mainly of interviews with promi­
nent public figures who did not ask for confi­
dentiality but, instead, wanted their opinions 
to be widely known. Many persons I inter­
viewed in Argentina were aware of the poten­
tial personal, political, and even legal 
repercussions of their accounts. Most inter­
viewees were representative members of the 
armed forces, the Roman Catholic Church, 
human rights groups, and former guerrilla 
organizations who were, a&er the 1983 turn 
to democracy, in the middle of a heated public 
debate about the years of repression. I do not 
doubt that many shared their views with 

162 ANTONIUS C. G. M. ROBBEN 
candor, but I also know that their discourse 
was repeatedly managed to enhance its effec­
tiveness . Again, there is a similarity with con­
temporary accounts of the Jewish holocaust. 
Discussing eyewitness accounts of the mass 
killings in Auschwitz and the Warsaw and 
Belzec ghettos, Young concludes: "Unlike 
memoirs written after events, these first reports 
tend to be more self-reflexive and aware of 
their words' immediate impact on readers. In 
this way, they are not calls for reflection or 
contemplation of the events' meaning (even as 
they suggested meaning) so much as they are 
demands for immediate action and justice" 
(1988:29). Most of the public figures I inter­
viewed in Argentina were weU a ware of the 
weight of their words in a time when opinions 
and interpretations about the "dirty war" were 
still being formed and reformulated. In the 
midst of this public debate I analyzed my own 
inhibitions, weaknesses, and biases, all to the 
benefit of a better understanding of both 
victim and victimiz er. The ethnographic seduc­
tion by victims and perpetrators of violence 
became, therefore, a font of, rather than an 
obstruction to, insight. 
Before exploring ethnogra phic seduction I 
shall enter into a brief but necessary discussion 
of transference in the analytic setting to be able 
to indicate where deduction fits in the multi­
stranded relationship between anthropologist 
and informant. Then I shall draw on the work 
of analysts who have treated survivors of Nazi 
concentration camps. Their contributions are 
valuable for a better understanding of the 
unique epistemological and methodological 
problems faced when conducting research 
among victims and perpetrators of violence. In 
the main part of this article I shall analyze my 
resistance, encapsu lation, and countertransfer­
ential reactions to my Argentine interlocutors 
and offer some reflections on how to cope with 
ethnographic seduction. 
Transference and 
Countertransference 
The concept of transference is of paramount 
importance to psychoanalytic theory and prac­
tice. Controversy continues to reign among 
practitioners about the precise scope of trans-ference, but many will agree with the follow­
ing definition: 
Transference is the experiencing of impulses, 
feelings, fantasies, attitudes, and defenses with 
respect to a person in the present which do 
not appropriately fit that person but are a rep­
etition of responses originating in regard to 
significant persons of early childhood, uncon­
sciously displaced on to persons in the 
present. The two outstanding characteristics 
of transference phenomena are (1) it is an 
indiscriminate, non-selective repetition of the 
past, and (2) it ignores or distorts reality. It 
is inappropriate. (Greenson and Wexler 
1969:28; see also Greenson 1967:15 1-2)3 
An example of transference is an analysand's 
aggression toward the analyst that should, in 
fact, be directed at, and is intended for, the 
father. "What is fundamentally at issue in 
transference, is how a discourse that is 
masked, the discourse of the unconscious, 
takes a hold of a discourse that is apparent" 
(Lacan 1988:247). In other words, the 
analysand's hostility is the medium through 
which the unconscious desire -in this case the 
repressed wish to harm the father -is being 
transmitted. Many hours of contact between 
analyst and analysand may result in the devel­
opment of a full-blown transference neurosis 
in which this all-absorbing relationship 
becomes the center of analytic attention. An 
analysis of the verbal and nonverbal manifes­
tations of this neurosis allows the analyst to 
unravel the structure of the analysand's uncon­
scious, and enables the analysand to correct his 
or her behavior. In addition to this transference 
on to the analyst, the latent discourse of the 
uncons cious may tag on to the manifest dis­
course of dreams and free associations. The 
analyst will use dreams, slips of the tongue, 
and jokes as causeways into the unconscious. 
Truth is hidden in the error of manifest dis­
course, and accident ally revealed by inade­
quate ways of concealment. Lacan sums this 
up in the aphorism "Error taking flight in 
deception and recaptured by mistake" 
(1988:273). 
·Attention to the manifest discourse of trans­
ference is necessary to understand or overcome 
the analysand's resistance to an archaeology of 

TERROR AND VIOLENCE IN ARGENTINA 163 
the unconscious. The analysis of these resis­
tances may be a collaborative effort, but at 
times it may also require an adversarial stance 
by the analyst. Analysands may refuse to admit 
the existence of the transference, or they may 
wallow in it. They may resist acknowledging 
the relations between past experiences, present 
transferences, and recent stimuli that triggered 
these connections. Much of the analytic treat­
ment exists in understanding these resistances 
and providing the analysand conscious insight 
into the repressed wishes and desires of the 
unconsci ous (see Freud 1905; Rawn 1987; 
Zetzel 1956). 
Psychoanalysts are not immune to transfer­
ence. They themselves may project feelings on 
their analysands. Some of these projections 
hark back to their own childhood. Others may 
be triggered by the patient's transferences. In a 
short but influential article, Heimann uses the 
term countertran sference "to cover all the feel­
ings which the analyst experiences towards his 
patient" (1950:81). Some of these feelings may 
be transfer ential, but others may be counter­
transferential in that ·they are "the patient's 
creation" (Heimann 1950:83}. Unrecognized 
countertransference reactions will draw ana­
lysts into a whirlpool of uncontrolled associa­
tions that make them lose their analytic stance. 
Heimann argues that analysts must therefore 
not deny or repress these feelings but must 
analyze them to the benefit of their analysands. 
Countertransf erential phenomena do not nec­
essarily interfere with a proper analysis but, 
instead, should be welcomed and utilized to 
gain a deeper insight in the patient's uncon­
scious. Heimann does not recommend an 
empathetic discharge because "[i]n my view 
such honesty is more in the nature of a con­
fession and a burden to the patient. In any case 
it leads away from the analysis" (1950:83}. 
Despite Heimann' s heed to restrict the 
analysis to interpretational interventions and 
not to burden the analysand with an emotional 
involvement, soon psychoanalysts began to 
explore the possibilities of actively manipulat­
ing the relationship with their patients.4 They 
realized that nontransferential interactions 
with their analysands could substantially facil­
itate but also frustrate the analytic treatment. 
Hence the ttansfere ntial relationship was dif­
ferentiated from both the analytic alliance and the "real" relationship between analyst and 
analysand. The term analytic or working 
alliance refers to "the patient's motivation to 
overcome his illness, his sense of helplessness, 
his conscious and rational willingness to coop­
erate, and his ability to foUow the instructions 
and insights of the analyst" ( Greenson 
1967:192). In other words, there must be a 
basic trust between analyst and patient that 
both will and can help one another in a suc­
cessful treatment. 
Attention was also drawn to the so-called 
real interaction as a critique of the Kleinian 
position that all reactions in the analytic 
session are transferenti al. There was a growing 
awareness that analyst and analysand have 
opinions about one another that cannot be 
subsumed under either their transferential or 
their working relationship. Some even argued 
that patients must first be able to sustain 
"real" transference-free relationships before 
they can enter into an analytic working 
alliance (Greenson and Wexler 1969; 
Sechehaye 1956). Both relationships influence 
the interpretive efforts {Abend 1989; Greenson 
1967:217; Greenson and Wexler 1909}. Taken 
together, these reassessments of the transferen­
tial relationship transformed the psychoana­
lyst from the stereotypic stoic and faceless 
tabula rasa, which was to be the most recep­
tive object of the analysand's inscriptions, to a 
person who demonstrated genuine care 
and, albeit cautiously, displayed empathy and 
emotion toward his or her patients. 
Empathy and Anxiety in 
Analyzing Victims of 
Violence 
The therapeutic significance of empathy 
received important clinical support from the 
treatment of Jewish holocaust survivors. In 
a groundbreaking article Grubrich-Simitis 
argued that expressed empathy was crucial to 
psychoanalytic work with first- and second­
generation survivors of Nazi concentration 
camps: "What he perceives of his analyst's 
anxiety, horror, shame, and pain ... proves to 
the patient, psychically, the reality of these 
events" (1984:313}. The survivor finds in the 

164 ANTONIUS C. G. M. ROBBEN 
emotions of the analyst a confirmation of the 
reality of a psychotic universe that systemati­
cally dismantled the ego boundaries between 
his or her inner and outer realities. "Examples 
of this are the deindividual ization caused by 
replacing names with numbers, the demolition 
of shame barriers, the elimination of privacy 
and intimacy, and the removal of clocks and 
calendars" (Grubrich-Simitis 1984:307). 
Instead . of interpreting the analysand's dis­
course as masking a latent discourse of the 
unconscious -the usual analytic procedure -
the survivor 's talk about concentration camps 
has to be accepted at face value. Treating the 
manifest discourse as a displaced unconscious 
fantasy would shatter the very reality that 
needs confirmation before the actual analysis 
can begin. Only the acknowledgment of the 
psychotic world of Auschwitz as real, and not 
as a nightmare, can lead to the restoration of 
a healthy ego that can distinguish reality from 
fantasy. 5 This "phase of joint acceptance of 
the Holocaust reality," as Grubrich-Simitis 
(1984:303) calls it, takes place only in part 
within the realm of transference and counter­
transference, and cannot be separated from 
the "real" relationship between analyst and 
analysand. As a matter of fact, the building of 
a "real" relationship through the demonstra­
tion of empathy and emotion is a prerequisite 
for a successful working alliance. The 
analysand has not only to be convinced that 
the analyst believes his or her reality, but also 
needs visible and audible signals that the 
analyst can bear the burden of transference. 
The survivor will only be able to use the 
analyst as a substitute -for the concentration 
camp guard or the mother who died in the gas 
chamber -when the emotional strength of the 
emerging �elationship has been put to the test 
(Pines 1986). An analyst who either does not 
visibly empathize with the survivor or breaks 
down uncontrollably will not be able to estab­
lish an effective analytic alliance and therefore 
will fail to provide help and treatment. This 
empathy bears considerable emotional cost. 
The deep feelings of insecurity and destruction 
of basic trust engendered in these patients by 
their Holocaust experience contributed to the 
initial difficulty of maintaining a classical ana­
lytical technique for patient and analyst alike. Indeed, the painful countertransference feel­
ings of shock and deep despair at man's inhu­
manity to man frequently evoked a strong 
desire to distance the patient emotionally, and 
to avoid the analytic empathy and under­
standing that are essential to the working 
through of the patient's problems. (Pines 
1986:304) 
The analyst tends to protect himself or 
herself against the onslaught of unwritten prin­
ciples of social life. Fundamental social prac­
tices of coexistence -existential in origin yet 
cultural in practice -that constitute the rock 
bottom of humanness are disturbed. The 
analyst realizes that this foundation is a human 
construction that has to be reproduced con­
tinuously in a myriad of small and larger social 
acts. There is no guarantee that people will not 
suddenly rescind the social contract and create 
a world of utter debasement. The analyst real­
izes that this may also happen to her, and that 
she may never again regain trust and faith in 
her fellow human beings. She may even fear 
that she herself may be capable of extreme 
violence. The abhorrence is empathetic, the 
anxiety unconscious. These countertransfer­
ence feelings are so troubling that they trigger 
defense reactions. It is this emotional as well 
as professional tendency to withhold empathy 
that need to be resisted by the analyst who 
wants to help concentration camp survivors 
and their children (Grubrich-Sirnitis 1981).6 
These clinical experiences have several 
implications for interview situations between 
ethnographers and victims or perpetrators of 
violence. The first implication is that transfer­
entia! and countertransf erential feelings may 
arise in any extended face-to-face interview 
situation -not just analytic encounters -and 
especially when the conversation revolves 
around highly emotional issues that touch the 
basis of our common humanity. Second, per­
sonal defenses tend to be erected to protect 
oneself from these emotions. Such resistance is 
reinforced by social science research practices 
that favor objectivity, neutralit y, and detach­
ment. Third, visible empathy and counter­
transference facilitate the sharing of life stories 
when the interviewee's past experiences have 
caused a basic distrust of others, especially 
when his or her personal experiences have 

TERROR AND VIOLENCE IN ARGENTINA 165 
been discredited publicly . Fourth, the interview 
situation has a social dynamic that exceeds the 
identifications, projections, transferences, and 
sympathies which occur during the meeting. 
The final implication is that our theories about 
face-to-face encounters influence our interpre­
tation of the conversations. Concepts such as 
rapport, impression management, and presen­
tation of self provide the interviewer with cues 
that affect the social dynamic and interpreta­
tion of the interview. 
An interview situation does not provide 
enough time for the development of a trans­
ference neurosis, but it does offer a setting for 
transfere nce, as has been shown systematically 
in Devereux's work (1967) on countertrans­
ference reactions among anthropologists (see 
also Hunt 1989). The interview between 
anthropologist and informant is in this respect 
similar to the pre-analytic interview. Except 
when severe neuroses or psychoses oblige the 
assignment of an analyst, an analysand will 
conduct a series of preliminary interviews with 
several potential analysts. Skin feeling and per­
sonal liking are far more important to the 
eventual choice than the display of theoretical 
knowledge or interpretive ability. Subtle trans­
ferential and countertransfere ntial cues in this 
fleeting relationship are decisive. 
Next to these transferential reactions, the 
social dynamics of the working alliance and 
the "real" relationship between analyst and 
analysand are relevant to ethnographic inter­
view situations. The working alliance is the 
equivalent of rapport in anthropological field­
work. Good rapport, or a productive dialogic 
alliance, makes the informant willing to 
respond to the anthropologist's questions and 
queries. Finally, the quality of the "real, rela­
tionship of nontransferential, everyday inter­
action between analyst and analysand is also 
important between ethnographer and infor­
mant. Ethnographers can only conduct proper 
research when they succeed in establishing and 
maintaining genuine social relationships with 
people. 
These prereqmsttes of anthropolo gical 
research harbor a potential danger. If trust and 
sincerity are so necessary for the successful 
outcome of a research project, then the ethno­
grapher will go to lengths to achieve such 
favorable conditions and may unconsciously turn a blind eye to contrary signs. Room for 
circumvention has been created. The eager 
ethnographer might be kept away from cul­
turally sensitive information under the false 
impression that the excellent rapport has 
opened all doors. The ethnographer may be 
seduced, may be directed away from his 
research objective under the impression of a 
good dialogic relationship. 
Ethnographic seduction is the leading astray 
of an ethnographer from an intended path of 
knowledge and interpretation. This seduction 
occurs most effectively at the intersection of 
the transferential and the working relationship 
where the informant consciously directs the 
ethnographer away from a proper interpreta­
tion of the discourse that arises in the rela­
tionship.7 Seduction cannot be confined to 
either one of these two relationships but strad­
dles them. In more psychoanalytic terms, 
seduction is the conscious maneuvering of 
unconscious resistance. 
Ethnogr aphic Seduction 
and the Dialogic Alliance 
Just as an analyst may bow to the patient's 
effective resistance, so ethnographers may 
have inappropriate countertransferences that 
cause a loss of empathetic detachment and 
may even harm their informants (see Tobin 
1986). Anthropologists may become involved 
in transferences with privileged informants but 
seldom have the professional training to turn 
the transferential relationships to their inter­
pretational benefit. In their fleering social 
encounters with many informants, they do not 
differ from analysts who conduct preliminary 
interviews with potential analysands. Seduc­
tion is most effective under these constraints. 
Baudrillard (1990:8) defines seduction as the 
manipulation of appearances. 8 Seduction wins 
researchers over through a claim to truth, 
authenticity, and genuine insight. Seduction 
trades their critical stance as interpreters for 
an illusion of congeniali ty with the research 
subjects. This being so, seduction is more 
than just impression management. The manip­
ulation succeeds best when it operates not only 
on the interactional but also on the psy­
chological level of the two interlocutors. 

166 ANTONIUS C. G. M. ROBBEN 
Countertransference makes the ethnographer 
feel as if he or she has entered into the skin of 
the interviewee and understands the discourse 
from within its producer A In fact, what has hap­
pened is that the ethnographer has introjected 
the informant's 'created projection; a projection 
that has been disguised as transferential affect. 
Ethnographic fieldwork operates and 
advances through a dialectic of involvement 
and detachment, of participation and observa­
tion, that is comparable to the psychoanalytic 
oscillation between introjection and projec­
tion. "As the patient speaks, the analyst will, 
as it were, become introjectively identified with 
him, and having understood him inside, will 
reproject him and interpret " (Money-Kyrle 
1956:361). This dialectic becomes suspended 
by seduction. Seduction sidesteps empathy and 
insight. Seduction makes the ethnographer fail 
to maintain a degree of independence toward 
the informant. What is mistakenly regarded as 
empathy is in fact countertransferential identi� 
fication. The distinction is important for an 
understanding of ethnographic seduction 
because undetected countertransf erence debil­
itates anthropological insight by drawing the 
ethnographer into an orbit of identification 
and a corresponding view of the world. 
In both empathy and countertransference an 
identification is effected with the patient. In 
empathy the identification is transient, a tem­
porary sharing of derivative expressions of the 
patient's unconscious fantasies and wishes .. .. 
In the case of countertransference, however, _ 
the analyst remains fixed at the point of iden­
tification with the patient. He is caught up in 
conflicts identical to those of the patient. 
Accordingly, the analyst becomes prone to the 
vicissitudes of these conflicts, and he may tend 
to act out or to respond defensively. (Arlow 
1985:165-6; see also Abend 1986) 
The difficulty with seduction is that the 
ethnographer is often not aware of its taking 
place and, moreover, may even seek it out 
unconsciously. Ethnographic seduction makes 
the interviewer feel that he or she has arrived 
at a profound understanding and has 
somehow entered a back region that hides a 
deeper truth. Like Freud's belated realization 
of his countertransference on Dora, it is only after reviewing the information gathered and 
examining the dialogic development of the 
interview that an ethnographer realizes that 
seduction had been mistaken for empathy and 
good rapport. 
Ethnographers may become so wrapped in 
their countertransference that they are led 
astray from their research objective, namely, 
analyzing the interlocutor's discourse and 
piecing together an account of the issues under 
study. Seduction empowers the interviewee in 
relation to the ethnographer. Ethnographic 
seduction is the combination of a deliberate 
maneuvering of the dialogic alliance by the 
interviewee and the unconscious countertrans­
ferential reaction by the interviewet. 9 The adjec­
tive "ethnographic" refers to the intention of 
people to achieve the most favorable descrip­
tion of themselves and their social group within 
the expressed context of their culture and 
society. The ethnographer is not a passive 
subject in this manipulation. Crapanzano 
(1980, 1994:236) has convincingly shown that 
the depiction of culture is negotiated and con­
structed between anthropologists and infor­
mants. Ethnogra phic seduction adds one more 
dimension to this complex mutual assemblage. 
This maneuvered construction becomes 
especially relevant in the case of victims and 
perpetrators of violence who have high per­
sonal and political stakes in legitimizing their 
interpretation of history. The �etired generals, 
former guerrilla commanders, human rights 
leaders, bishops, and politicians I interviewed 
between 1989 and 1991 were conscious of 
their role in the national debate that waged 
during the fieldwork period about the histori­
cal reconstruction of the "dirty war." They did 
not simply want to tell their story to an inter­
ested outsider, clear their name, or give way to 
a catharsis; as important players in the public 
arena, they had a political stake in making me 
adopt their truths. They perceived foreign 
researchers as the harbingers of history who 
would retell their stories, and through their 
investiture as scientists provide these with the 
halo of objectivity and impartiality that their 
academic stature entailed. 
Each party in Argentina tried to draw me 
into their camp and persuade me to analyze the 
decades of violence from their standpoint with 
phrases such as "You will be able to tell the 

TERROR AND VIOLENCE IN ARGENTINA 167 
truth about what really happened in 
Argentina"; "We need foreign researchers like 
you who will be able to tell the truth which we 
cannot write"; " Abroad, they can write a truth 
which nobody wants to publish here." Some 
even tried to induce guilt: "I have told you my 
story so that you can write the truth"; "Do not 
use the things I have told you against us"; 
"Make sure that my story can never be used 
by those who killed my daughter." 
But why did they resort to seduction? Those 
who dispute power, authority, and history 
realize that arguments alone fail to persuade, 
that charisma is the privilege of the gifted few, 
but that appearances are often taken at face 
value. This impression management is all the 
more effective when complemented by a subtle 
psychol ogical dynamic that succeeds in 
making the researcher experience the discourse 
as genuine instead of constructed. Seduction is 
the strategy, while countertransference is the 
unconscious process through which this accep­
tance can be achieved most successfully. 
Seduction and Resistance 
in Argentina 
Most generals, bishops, politicians, human 
rights leaders, guerrilla commanders, and 
former disappeared and political prisoners I 
interviewed in Argentina molded their dis­
course to enhance its effectiveness. I am not 
saying that accounts or events were made up, 
even though this may have occurred occasion­
ally, but I argue that the repeated answering of 
the same questions and addressing the same 
issues have led to a selection, partly conscious 
and partly unconscious, of those replies and 
formulations that have proven to be most per­
suasive. They were keenly aware of the impact 
of certain words on their audience. For 
example, Argentine human rights leaders 
would consciously use words such as concen­
tration camp, Nazi, SS, Holocaust, Nacht und 
Nebel, and Auschwitz to communicate most 
effectively the suffering, the state directed 
destructiveness, and the genocidal magnitude 
of the "dirty war." 
These references to the Jewish holocaust 
were not unfounded. The anti-Semitism in the 
secret detention centers run by the Argentine armed forces became widely known after a 
national investigative commission on the fate 
of the disappeared published its findings. Pris­
oners of Jewish origin were treated with par­
ticular cruelty and obliged to shout "Heil 
Hitler!" and "I love Hitler!" Pictures of Adolf 
Hitler have been seen in torture chambers, 
and swastikas were commonly displayed 
(CONADEP 1986:67-72, 259; see also Diaz 
and Zucco 1987). The anti-Semitism of part of 
the military leadership was evident in delirious 
beliefs about Jewish conspiracies, such as the 
Plan Andinia. This plan was believed to be a 
conspiracy by Israel and the international 
Zionist movement to take over Patagonia and 
found an independent Jewish state to be called 
Andinia (Timerman 1981:73-4). 
The anti-Semitism, the identification with 
Nazism and the frequent display of its 
symbols, and the extreme cruelty toward 
Jewish prisoners are undeniable, but these sim­
ilarities do not necessarily make World War II 
and Argentina's "dirty war" comparable his­
torical events. However, its proponents met 
any doubt on my side about this comparison 
with an accusation of Eurocentrism or, even 
worse from an emotional point of view, with 
the question of whether their dead and their 
suffering were somehow less important and 
painful than those of the Jewish holocaust. 
Take the following dialogue with the Jewish 
father of a disappeared son. 
Q: ... there are people who say, "This was a 
holocaust." What do you think of this? 
A: This Tuesday we are meeting with a 
Holocaust survivor in Argentina ro try to 
involve him, to see what room there is for 
our holocaust within the context of the 
holocaust in the world. Those who claim 
the Holocaust as their own do not like it 
that we have said that there was a holo­
caust in Argentina. Jews like it even less 
when we say that there were 1,500 disap­
peared Jews among the 10,000 mentioned 
by the CONADEP [Argentine National 
Commission on the Disappeared] .... 
Q: But can one use, in your opinion, the term 
holocaust for Argentina as well? 
A: I don't know about the meaning. I believe 
that it has the same value as genocide. 
When one part of a population kills 
another part of the population then it is a 

168 ANTONIUS C. G. M. ROBBEN 
genocide or it is a holocaust. Whatever. If 
the problem is one of numbers, then let's 
return to Brecht. 
Q: Indeed. 
A: Well then, let's stop worrymg about 
numbers, that is to say, as I believe a 
general or, no, a minister said: "When two 
children die of hepatitis it's a drama; when 
200 die it's an epidemi c." That's fine, it's 
a statistic .... I don't know if one can call 
1,500 kids a holocaust. However, why I 
think, yes, it is important to refer to the 
Holocaust is that it was the same ideology 
that took the Nazis or the Germans to 
make concentration camps and to kill the 
Jews -and not only Jews -in the concen­
tration camps; this is also what reigned 
here in the con�entration camps. That's 
why there was a photograph of Hitler. 
That's why they sang "let's make soap" 
and that's why they killed people in the 
way they did, whether by throwing them 
from planes, executing them, killing 
them with injections, or whatever made 
them prepare clandestine cemeteri es. All 
these things had to do with the same phe­
nomenon. The same Holocaust policy was 
transferred to here. 
Such dialogues overwhelmed me at first. 
Unlike the Argentine psychoanalyst Kusnet­
zoff, who asked the rhetorical question "What 
does the Holocaust have to do with me?" 
while treating a Jewish survivor from a Nazi 
concentration camp, I became absorbed in 
the analogies between Europe and Argentina. 
Kusnetzoff (1985) expressed the countertrans­
ferential denial of his Jewish identity during 
the analysis, while I had a countertransferen­
tial identification because of a personal fate of 
family and national history. It became virtually 
impossible to continue asking questions about 
the nature of the repression and the methods 
of disappearance when all further questions 
were already preempted by the reference to the 
Jewish holocaust. 
Even though the analogies between Europe 
and Argentina were not just drawn in my pres­
ence but were part of the national discourse on 
the "dirty war," it became clear to me that my 
interviewees were conscious of both their emo­
tional and rhetorical impact on me. Human 
rights leaders and former guerrilla leaders emphasized the similarities in ideology and 
repressive practice. Military officers vehe­
mently rejected such comparisons. In the fol­
lowing exchange with a prominent general of 
the 1976 junta, I tried to inquire into the 
nature of the so-called criminal plan (plan 
criminal) designed to make political opponents 
disappear. This criminal plan was central to 
the prosecutor's case in the trial against the 
heads of the military juntas: "In sum, it can be 
affirmed that the commanders established 
secretly a criminal mode of combat ing terror­
ism" (Camara Nacional 1987:266). The 
verdict stated, "It has been proven, through 
declarations from the highest military leaders 
who participated in the antisubversive opera­
tions, that the orders were oral, that the oper­
ations and detentions were covert" and that 
the plan consisted of an extensive network of 
special task forces, interrogation centers, secret 
detention centers, and procedures for the dis­
appearance of people (Camara Nacional 
1987:857). In my effort to make myself under­
stood, the dialogue takes an unexpected turn. 
Q: The Armed Forces are accused of, of 
having had a criminal plan. 
A: This, this, this, pardon me for interrupt­
ing you. About this criminal plan .... 
[pause] Let me remind you, if there is a 
criminal plan then someone must have 
written it somewhere. / 
Q: Not necessarily, because, for example, 
what we may call the criminal plan of the 
Holocaust was never written. It is not 
written. [I am referring to the absence of 
a written, worked-out plan that predates 
the 1942 Wannsee Confere nce.) 
A: Which plan? 
Q: Of, of, of, of the Holocaust m, m 
Germany. It was neither written. 
A: No, no, no, but [in Germany] there is a 
something and that is-
Q: And I pose this question because the Euro­
peans see it this way. No? They see a sim­
ilarity between the two [criminal plans]. [I 
sensed that the general was groping for a 
reply and assumed that he might have felt 
an accusatory undertone in my question, 
�o I interrupted him to draw the dialogue 
onto a less personal and more analytic 
level by referring to a common European 
perception of the disappearances .] 

TERROR AND VIOLENCE IN ARGENTINA 169 
A: Certainly, but notice, take notice that this 
is a barbarity. [This abrupt switch from 
affirmation to outrage is crucial in this 
example of ethnographic seduction 
because it allows the general to dodge my 
question.] Do you realize that comparing 
the Holocaust in Europe -the Jews that 
were turned into soap in the gas camps 
and whatever more-with what has hap­
pened in Argentina .... [pause] But that is 
an enormous absurdity! [The general 
raises his voice in anger.] 
Q: But there are people who say-[I am taken 
aback by his reaction and try to attenuate 
the situation. The general picks up the 
cue.] 
A: Of course, because that is what the 
Marxist organizations, the left, the 
Mothers of the May Square, have 
ac�ieved! [with a voice of indignation that 
turns to appeasement] .... There, millions 
of people, Jews and non-Jews died in the 
concentration camps of the Nazis. Here, 
what? No comparison. Here, there were 
no gas chambers, there was nothing that 
looked like it. Sq, you say that in Europe 
there was no written plan? [The general 
returns to my question.] Look, there were 
orders given and orders reissued. There 
was an entire organization, the SS, there 
were concentration camps, there were gas 
chambers and there were all -
Q: Of course. 
A: Here, where? 
The general guided the discussion away 
from the disappear ances in Argentina by con­
sciously turning my analytic analogy into an 
empirical comparison, and by making a 
rhetorical detour that deterred me from further 
pursuing the topic. After deliberately misinter­
preting my question and placing me into the 
accuser's seat, he returns to the actual question 
and denies the existence of a criminal Argen­
tine plan, simply because the two historical 
realities do not correspond. This and other 
instances of managed misinterpretation were 
not just displays of the rhetorical finesse of my 
interlocutors, of their adroitness to corner me 
with clever arguments; these were conscious 
attempts at ethnographic seduction because 
my interlocutors speculated on emotional 
effects -some of which have been identified here as countertransferential reactions -that 
did not require the perceptiveness of a psy­
choanaly st to anticipate. My status as a Dutch­
man, my country's obsession with World War 
II, and the great resonance in the Netherlands 
of the issue of the Argentine disappeared, con­
stituted a fertile ground for seduccion in its 
colloquial sense. If I was visibly moved, could 
no longer sustain the dialogue, did not pursue 
the topic raised, or failed to further explore 
their answers to my questions, then that was 
enough proof that the seduction had been 
successful. 10 
The verbal dimension of the attempts at 
seduction could be quickly discovered after 
analyzing the transcripts of the interviews. 11 
The nonverbal dimension was harder to delin­
eate because appearan ces and their manipula­
tion are cultural practices. Nonverbal cues 
such as eye contact and tone of voice vary 
across cultures (Ewing 1987). The most impor­
tant means of nonverbal seduction in 
Argentina was the show of emotion by my 
interlocutors. Let me emphasize that I am con­
vinced that the tears I have seen people shed 
were real and sincere, but I also believe that 
their manifestation can be directed. These 
emotions were allowed to run free in my pres­
ence because they proved to be a powerful 
means of communicating grief. At other occa­
sions, the harboring of feeling was more 
important. One member of the Mothers of the 
May Square - a group of women who drew 
worldwide attention to the disappearance of 
their children with weekly protest marches in 
down town Buenos Aires -told me that she 
repressed her emotions at conferences abroad 
in order not to pass off as a "hysterical 
woman." On the other hand, the open display 
of emotion in Argentina powerfully demon­
strated the authenticity of her anguish but, at 
the same time, gave the military regime the 
opportunity to call the mothers derogatorily 
"the crazy women of the May Square." 
Why is the show of emotion seductive? As 
Baudrillard has said, "To seduce is to appear 
weak" (1990:83). The interviewees did not try 
to impose an interpretation on me but coaxed 
me into a desired understanding by showing 
their own vulnerabilit ies. For example, I 
seldom asked directly about the abuse to 
which my interlocutors had been subjected, 

170 ANTONIUS C. G. M. ROBBEN 
but I concentrated on their interpretation of 
the political violence of the 1970s. Some were 
surprised at my reluctance and volunteered to 
give me detailed accounts. They had become 
accustomed to journalists who asked them to 
provide graphic descriptions. I generally 
responded that such painful recollection was 
not necessary because I had already read their 
declaration� to courts and human rights orga­
nizations. In retrospect I realized that my 
reluctance was countertransferent ial. I wanted 
to spare them, but I also wanted to spare 
myself. The stressful prospect of hearing these 
accounts provoked defenses against a verbal 
assault that triggered reactions of rejection and 
self-preservation (see also Bozzolo 1988). Lis­
tening to the helplessness of victims of torture 
arouses deep anxieties of abandonment that 
one wants to repress, even at the cost of sacri­
ficing important research data. An excerpt 
from an interview with a very active member 
of the Mothers of the May Square, who had 
been tortured to reveal the whereabouts of 
her son, illustrates such reaction. In the fol­
lowing exchange I try repeatedly to draw the 
conversation away from the woman, who, 
however:, continues to refocus my attention on 
herself. 
A: Before my sons disappeared, they took my 
husband and me. 
Q: Ah, before, before your sons? 
A: Yes, because they were looking for them 
and not .... [pause] At that time they 
thought that it would be easier to force the 
mother to say something, no? Or to say 
where they were. But if I gave life to my 
son, would I then bring him death? 
Q: Indeed [claro]. 
A: Eh? That they did not realize, those, those 
beings [sere's], because they are not men. 
And, and I tell you that they take one's 
dignity away because they undressed me, 
they tied me to a table like Tupac Amaru. 
And this is to take one's dignity away 
because I would have preferred to have 
been shot instead of having them done this 
to me. Isn't it? And the prod? Not in my 
life did I know what an electric prod was 
and there I learned it. And you feel so 
impotent, so humiliated. Before ... naked 
before ... I don't know how many men 
there were, I was blindfolded .... [pause] Q: Where did this all happen? At the police 
station or was it -[Here I begin to draw 
myself away from her story by switching 
from the event to its location.] 
A: No, at the ESMA [Navy Mechanics 
School]. 
Q: Ah, at the ESMA. 
A: Yes, at the ESMA. 
Q: And for how long were you there? 
A: 48 hours. So, I can imagine what it must 
be or what it must have been-
Q: One year or more. [This is an improper 
intervention that, again, tries to switch the 
attention from the woman to a more 
general discussion of how long disap­
peared persons were being held at the 
ESMA.) 
A: -for those who were locked up. I was 
blindfolded for 48 hours. I thought I 
would become insane, I swear. I thought I 
would become insane because I even saw 
my dog. I saw the armchair from my 
house. And I, what am I going to see if I'm 
blindfolded ? I did not take off the blind­
fold. My husband, yes. I was in a cell next 
to him but he did not know where 1 was. 
But I heard his voice and this, you see, 
gave me strength . Because when they 
applied the electric prod to me they told 
me that they were doing the same thing to 
my husband. And no, they did not touch 
him. 
Q: Ah, they didn't touch him? 
A: They didn't touch him. 
Q: Why, why do you think? [Instead of 
allowing her to finish the account of her 
torture, I switch to the husband, who to 
my relief had not been harmed physically.] 
A: Well, I think that they must have believed 
that the mother is weaker or that the 
mother is closer to the son -
Q: Yes. 
A: -and knows more. 
Q: Indeed. 
A: It is possible, but they were mistaken, they 
were mistaken. [The woman tries to re­
turn to her account, but I continue asking 
about her husband.] 
Q: And, and your husband took off the blind­
fold and, and, and, saw something? 
A:_ He saw the place. Yes, he saw the place, 
saw inscriptions that were there. And 
every time they opened the door they 
made him cover his face again. He had an 

TERROR AND VIOLENCE IN ARGENTINA 171 
elastic blindfold; it was a black rag with 
an elastic. On the other hand, they used 
adhesive tape for me that they had stolen 
from my house. My husband had a phar­
macy. Well then, this adhesive tape was 
poorly put, you see? They covered my 
eyes, both of them well-closed, poorly, 
OK, very ugly, ha, ha, ha. 
Q: Terrible. And did they leave you later at 
home or ... ? [I quickly acknowledge her 
suffering, but then I move as fast as pos­
sible away from the scene of torture.] 
This dynamic of flight and inveiglement 
demonstrates the complexity of ethnographic 
seduction. The tortured woman tries to convey 
her terrible experience in such a way that I will 
sense her physical pain and, by inference, will 
become convinced of her political view on the 
years of dictatorial repression. It is her aware­
ness of a connection between palpable descrip­
tion and historical interpretation, together 
with her mission to publicize the political 
views of the Mothers of the May Square, that 
make this dialogue into an example of ethno­
graphic seduction. In this example, the seduc­
tion succeeds in its unconscious effect, but fails 
in its conscious intent. It is successful in 
impairing my methodological separation of 
empathy and detachment, but it does not 
manage to redirect my attention toward herself 
and her standpoint. Furthermore, by disentan­
gling myself from the woman's anguish I have 
neither accomplished the detached empathy 
essential to my research nor have I recorded 
the discourse I was after. It seems almost as if 
in his topsy-turvy situation the roles of 
researcher and research subject have become 
reversed, yet with both losing out. The inter­
viewee tries to provide the most detailed 
account of her torture, while the interviewer 
shies away from the volunteered information 
he wants to collect. 
Resistance among informants is a defense 
strategy with which anthropologists have great 
familiarity and which they try to overcome sys­
tematically, yet they pay generally little atten­
tion to their own resistances. 12 Unknowingly, 
anthropologists may erect their own obstruc­
tions. The ethnographer 's obstacles may 
become the informant's defenses that, in turn, 
the ethnographer then tries to scale. Ethnog-raphers try to gain access to their interlocutors' 
backstage, to the things that are most private 
to them. "The impressions that ethnographer 
and subjects seek to project to one another are 
... those felt to be favorable to the accom­
plishment of their respective goals: the ethno­
grapher seeks access to back-region 
information; the subjects seek to protect their 
secrets since these represent a threat to the 
public image they wish to maintain" (Berre­
man 1972:xxxiv). However. which boundary 
should they protect, and which region do they 
wish to enter? The ethnographer's and the 
informant's understanding of what constitutes 
secret knowledge and which intrusions should 
be resisted do not necessarily coincide. This 
disagreement provides opportunltles for 
ethnograp hic seduction. For example, many 
former political prisoners in Argentina 
regarded their torture as the most private and 
therefore most valuable back region. They 
sensed that this experience enhanced their 
credibility as a victim, voice, and witness of the 
years of violence and repression. Even though 
many had every intention of sharing their 
experiences with me, several still held back 
their accounts. The more persuasion was 
needed, the more persuasive the account 
would be. However , due to the unrecognized 
countertransference, I stopped at the threshold 
of this dark back region and did not insist on 
entering it. The consequence was that several 
informants failed to tell their story. The seduc­
tion had missed its goal. Nevertheless, the 
seduction succeeded unwantingly on another 
count. The voluntary offering of very personal 
experiences enhanced their credibility as infor­
mants. The stories which they did share with 
me became somehow more convincing, 
whether justified or not. The ethnographic 
seduction operated through a partial revela­
tion of a hidden world that was not further 
explored but was taken at face value in the 
belief that more knowledge could always be 
uncovered . 
Sometimes I would cross the threshold either 
because I wanted or because I was forced. This 
trespassing provoked a different countertrans­
ferential reaction. After listening to a hair­
raising account of torture and abuse, I felt 
exhausted and my mind would go blank. This 
happened, for instance, after an interview with 

172 ANTONIUS C. G. M. ROBBEN 
the father of a 17-year-old member of an out­
lawed political organization who disappeared 
in April 1976. After his son failed to arrive at 
a birthday party where he was expected, the 
father began a desperate search. He contacted 
an acquaintance who was a police officer, and 
they started making inquiries at the precincts 
and hospitals of Buenos Aires, all to no avail. 
After several months, the father came into 
contact with a colonel in active service through 
the mediation of a befriended retired first lieu­
tenant. The following dialogue took place: 
And he says, "Tell me what happened., So I 
told him what happened. And with all viru­
lence, you looked at ... [pause]. I looked at 
this man, but I tell you as I told you before, 
that I tried to see from all sides if I could find 
the point of the ... of the thread of ... to, to 
arrive at the thread or the needle in the 
haystack [punta del ovilla], trying to, to dis­
cover anything. After telling him everything, 
he says, "Good. Look, you have to do the fol­
lowing: you have to pretend as if your son has 
cancer." I was listening and saying to myself, 
"What is he saying?" [The colonel continues:] 
"Pretend that he has cancer and that they have 
... that he is in an operating room and that 
there is a butcher and a doctor; pray that it 
will be the doctor who will be operating on 
him." And then I looked at, at the one with 
whom I had made a certain friendship and he 
took hold of his head and covered his, his 
face. Because he must have said, he himself 
must have said, "What is this sonofabitch 
saying?" Because then he realized that aU his 
venom, his virulence came out of him [the 
colonel]. This man had stuck a dagger in my 
wound and had twisted it inside me. I say to 
him, "Pardon me." I say, "Sir, but you know 
something �" I said this because of what he 
was telling me. "No, no, I am weighing the 
various possibilities [hago una composici6n 
de Iugar] and I am making a supposition. I 
don't know anything of whar migbt have 
ha -" And I say, "But how do you have the 
gall to ... , " and because of my nerves the 
words couldn't come out but I had wanted to 
say, "You are a son of a thousand bitches." 
You see, tell him whichever barbarit y. And 
then the other saw my condition because he 
thought that I was going to lose it .... [pause] 
I wanted to grab him by the throat and stran­
gle him, but then anyone of those who were there would have taken their gun and killed 
me. There, for the first time in my life, the 
desire came over me to murder someone. I had 
been destroyed .... Something [my wife] 
didn't know. With the passage of time I have 
told her. These are unfortunate things that 
happen to you in life. And there, yes, it 
crossed my mind that yes, that day I could 
have ended up killing that man. I don't know 
what stopped me. Because I was desperate. 
But you cannot imagine how, with what sat­
isfaction he said what he was telling me. And 
you should analyze that, that this man was in 
active service. 
But I was unable to analyze. Exactly as he 
had tried to detect any sign in the face and 
words of the colonel that betrayed the tiniest 
bit of information about his son, but became 
paralyzed by the cruel supposition, so I was 
·unable to stand aside and observe. He had 
incorporated me into his torment, sometimes 
discursively placing me in his shoes, and at 
other times highlighting the moments of his 
greatest anguish. I could have asked him 
about the place of the meeting, the spatial 
arrangement of the offices, which army regi­
ment had been involved, whether he ever heard 
of the colonel again, how he knew that the 
man was a colonel and not an extortionist, and 
whether he ever saw the first lieutenant again. 
But my mind went blank, and I could only 
share this man's sorrow in silence, while he 
took me along on the incessant search for his 
son. 
Unlike the woman in the previous example, 
this man succeeds in totally absorbing me into 
his account. I believe that both interviewees 
were aware of the impact of their stories but 
did not stage them. There was no need to do 
so. The repeated narration of the experiences 
in public has led to its crystallization into the 
most moving and persuasive version.13 Never­
theless, narrators can never foresee the emo­
tional and countertransfer ential reactions of 
their interlocutors. The man and woman told 
their harrowing experiences in and with visible 
pain, but their accounts led in one instance to 
withdrawal and in the other to absorption. 
Both exchanges were seductive because they 
disabled the empathy-detachment dialectic, 
affected my critical stance, and deviated the 
research from its intended course and objec-

TERROR AND VIOLENCE IN ARGENTINA 173 
rive. The woman's account made me ask 
questions that skirted her torture, while the 
man's story made me unable to penetrate his 
emotional shroud with any questions at all. 
The more emotional the reaction, the greater 
the personal inhibition to further discuss these 
themes. I could no longer see the discourse 
behind the conversation, and sometimes would 
end the interview right there. 
This inhibition through silence can have at 
least four possible explanations.14 First, it 
might be a resistance. I fell into silence because 
I did not want to listen anymore to so much 
human degradation. I erected a wall to protect 
myself. Second, silence might result from the 
tacit understanding that probing deeper would 
be harmful to the narrator. At these moments 
of intense communication, one becomes 
sensitive to the limits of people's ability to 
relive their traumatic experiences. Reaching 
beyond these limits would be unethical and 
irresponsible because as ethnographers we 
have not been trained to provide psychologi-
. cal care in crisis situations. 15 Third, there 
may be a common awareness that silence 
marks the boundary of a secret area of knowl­
edge or emotion that cannot be trespassed 
upon. Finally, silence may be a consequence 
of overexte nded empathy. I became incorpo­
rated in the suffering through a common 
anguish fed by the countertransferential iden­
tification. I could only share the pain in silence 
during this joint acceptance of the reality of 
terror. 
At other times I would try to relieve the 
tense silence by asking about some minute 
detail or by switching to highly abstract 
themes of war and peace, or justice and pun­
ishment. I could only regain my professional 
composure by making a radical break with my 
worked-up emotions, as can be seen in the fol­
lowing excerpt from an interview with a 
rhetorically gifted former guerrilla comman­
der. We were discussing the debilitating effect 
of the disappearances on the guerrilla fighters 
and the organization's direct order either to 
commit suicide by swallowing a cyanide 
capsule or to resist torture for 48 hours if 
caught alive, all in the hope of protecting their 
comrades. The commander succeeded in 
drawing me into a world of army bases and 
secret camps by using the second person. A: And you did not know for sure, you didn't 
have guarantees, that whether you con­
tributed information or not, your destiny 
would always be the same. Or they used 
you because you did not confess and 
because you did not talk. They cut you up 
in pieces in front of the others to debili­
tate the weak or if you talked, rhen they 
would torture you afterwards anyway. 
And they kept you in a "refrigerato rt> 
[lingo for being in confinement] till they 
used you or they needed you. And if not, 
after you had the luck that they did not 
torture you, then they moved you [lingo 
for a liquidation] and killed you with 
whatever method they decided upon. 
Q: Eh, at this sinister note let's move to -
A: It seems as if we were in the camp! 
Q: So much the better! And, well, the first 
question I would like to ask is .... 
The commander could not hide his glee as 
he observed the contrast between the emotion 
on my face and my poorly veiled intention to 
move to another topic. He felt compelled to 
teU me so, while I pretended not to be shaken 
at all and even feigned a delight in his graphic 
description; only to quickly pose a new 
question. 
At other occasions my countertransfer enrial 
identification would also stir the emotions of 
my interlocutor. I was once told by an Argen­
tine anthropologist that one of my intervie­
wees, a former guerrillero, had told her that he 
had seen tears in my eyes during a stirring 
moment of our conversation. This show of 
emotion made him realize the tragedy of his 
own life and made him break down as well. A 
complete collapse -his as well as mine- of the 
guarded critical distance occurred that made 
me lose all dimensions of my research enter­
prise and made my interviewee forget his polit­
ical reasons for consenting to the convers ation. 
I had repressed this important moment in our 
dialogic relation until my Argentine colleague 
told me about it. The emotional breakdown 
marked a joint acceptance of "dirty war" 
reality that considerably strengthened my rela­
tion with the former guerrillero, and tore 
down our mutual resistance toward a more 
openhearted exchange. 
Thus seduction can work through confession 
but also through secrecy and mystifica tion. 

174 ANTONIUS C. G. M. ROBBEN 
Western scientists have for centuries inter­
nalized a Hermetic stance, desiring to penetrate 
discourse to reach a greater and deeper truth 
(Eco 1992:29-33). Psychoanalysis has even 
made it the essence of its clinical practice. It 
assumes a fundamental affinity between secrecy 
and resistance. 
What is peculiar to the field of psychoanaly­
sis is indeed the presupposition that the 
subject's discourse normally unfolds ... 
within the order of error, of misrecogn ition, 
even of negation -it is not quite a lie, it is 
somewhere between an error and a lie. These 
are the truths of crude common sense. But -
this is the novelty -during analysis, within 
this discourse which unfolds in the register of 
error, something happens whereby the truth 
irrupts, and it is not contradiction. [Lacan 
1988:265) 
Ethnographic seduction, on the other hand, · 
tries to dissuade the interviewer from finding 
a deeper truth behind the manifest discourse. 
Seduction takes from discourse its sense and 
turns it from its truth. It is, therefore, contrary 
to the psychoanalytic distinction between 
manifest and latent discourses. For the latent 
discourse turns the manifest discourse not 
from its truth, but towards its truth .... In 
seduction, by contrast, it is the manifest dis­
course-discourse at its most superficial-that 
turns back on the deeper order (whether con­
scious or unconscious) in order to invalidate 
it, substituting the charm and illusion of 
appearances. (Baudrillard 1990:53) 
The assumption in both psychoanalysis and 
anthropology that there is a deeper truth 
behind manifest discourse, and that a trans­
ference of that deeper truth on the analyst or 
ethnographer may tease out this truth, prepare 
the ground for seduction because it invites the 
recipient to surrender. Transference is only 
possible if the ethnographer opens himself or 
herself to the informant and allows for an 
empathetic introjection. Only a surrender to 
the informant's conditions of truth will yield 
the desired information and transference. 
Admonitory remarks about the political sensi­
tivity of the information serve as an additional 
strategy to overpower the interpretive stance of the observer. It is an invitation to complic· 
ity. This complicity becomes seductive if it 
leads to a countertransferential identification. 
In a certain way, anthropologists want to be 
seduced because it gives them the desired 
feeling of gaining access to a hidden world. 
The difficulty of obtaining such secrets does 
not only raise the value of the information but 
also inflates the researcher's ego and prestige. 
"When the knowledge is hidden, and revela­
tion demands hard, painful work but brings 
status in its wake, one treats these secrets with 
overvaluing awe" (Luhrmann 1989:138). 
Seduction directs this pseudosecret, yet mani­
fest, discourse to such an extent that the 
anthropologist believes that he or she is dis· 
covering a deeper truth that is validated by the 
protagonist. However , when the informant's 
seduction has succeeded, then part of this truth 
· lies only inside the anthropologist, and the 
privileged knowledge is his or her own 
reflection. 
People can look for a long time at them­
selves, provided they continue to see the same 
image. Reflections that keep changing can have 
a paralyzing effect. There were days when I 
talked in the morning to a victim of political 
persecution and in the afternoon with a mili­
tary officer who had been responsible for the 
repression. These days were stressful because 
they demanded radical swings in empathetic 
understanding. Defenses were / erected to 
prevent the incorporation of a dual identifica­
tion with victim and victimizer . A failure to 
keep both at bay could have resulted in severe 
ego conflicts. I had the double task of resisting 
the seductive maneuvers that tried to draw me 
emotionally into one camp, and I had to erect 
barriers within myself between the two sides. 
U both would succeed in their seduction, then 
I would have to deal with the consequences of 
internalizing their conflict. At times I tasted of 
this volatile mixture as I felt torn between two 
opposite accounts of the same event. I only 
regained my balance by analyzing in a very 
detached manner the nonverbal interaction 
and the conflicting discourse in terms of 
content and rhetoric. 
Some of my psychological tensions in 
Argentina were comparable to those experi­
enced by psychoanalysts who have worked 
with Jewish holocaust survivors, but, in 

TERROR AND VIOLENCE IN ARGENTINA 175 
addition to those basic anxieties, my research 
also uncovered cultural anxieties through my 
confrontation with different practices of vio­
lence. Torture may, at one time or another, 
occur in any country, but "there seem to be 
culturally-favoured forms of torture in differ­
ent societies. In Latin America, for example, 
there is little use of the falanga-related tortures 
[beating the soles of the feet], and a great deal 
of use of electrical forms of torture; in Greece, 
however, falanga greatly predominated" 
(Peters 1986:171). Hispanic torture practices 
differ from those of my own northwest Euro­
pean culture (see CONADEP 1986:20-51; 
Graziano 1992:158-65; Smirez-Orozco 1987). 
Torturers hit where it hurts most. They are 
conscious of their victim's cultural sensitivities. 
Listening to descriptions of certain forms of 
torture attacked the foundation of my cultural 
constitution. There was an immediate uncon­
scious reaction to deny the ensuing ethno­
graphic anxieties produced by the repression 
of cultural experiences in the field that corre­
spond to unconscious wishes and desires 
· (Devereux 1967:42-5}. The confrontation 
with forms of violence that do not belong to 
my cultural repertoire provoked anxieties 
that were difficult to recognize and understand 
but that nonetheless were present. Ethno­
graphic anxiety was yet another expression of 
the countertransferentiaJ relationship between 
my Argentine interlocutors and myself, as an 
ethnographer and as a European. 
Coping with Ethnogr aphic 
Seduction 
How can anthropologists become conscious of 
ethnographic seduction and use their knowl­
edge of transference and resistance to improve 
their cultural insight? Elsewhere I have shown 
how an analysis of ethnographic seduction by 
Argentine military officers led to a better 
understa nding of the "dirty war" practice of 
disappearance (Robben 1995). In this article I 
have concentrated principally , although not 
exclusively, on the transfer ential relation 
between ethnographer and informant. By way 
of ethnographic seduction the informant 
wards off attempts by the researcher to break 
through the manifest discourse, and maneu-vers the ethnographer's understandin g, posi­
tion, emotions, and unconscious countertrans­
ference to achieve that goal. Psychoanalytic 
theory proves helpful in making anthropolo­
gists aware of this seductive process within the 
ethnographic context. The principal differ­
ences between the ethnographic and the psy­
choanalytic encounter are that the 
ethnographer is often unaware of unconscious 
processes, and that the discourse is disguised 
in a seductive cloak that hampers instead of 
enhances ethnographic insight. Although 
attentive to narrative inconsistencies, jokes, 
mental blocks, and slips of the tongue, the 
ethnographer may still be seduced into accept­
ing the surface discourse because of his or her 
unrecognized immersion in a transfere ntial 
relationship. 
There are several common couotertransfer­
ential reactions among analysts that apply 
equally well to ethnographers. One set of reac­
tions occurs during the interview, such as dif­
ficulties to grasp the flow of associations, 
excessive emotion or boredom, irritability or 
sleepiness, and even feelings of love or hate. 
Other reactions take place afterward, such as 
frequent thoughts about the interviewee, pos­
sibly accompanied by depression, dreams and 
fantasies, as well as slips of the tongue and 
the compulsion to talk to others about the 
interviewee (see Arlow 1985: 173; Hunt 
1989:61-76; Winnicott 1949). These cues will 
make the ethnographer conscious of counter­
transfere ntial reactions so that in due time the 
strategy of seduction can be outlined. This dis­
covery process is distinct from the usual ana­
lytic situation because, unlike transference, 
ethnographic seduction is a consciously 
maneuvered projection. Additional cues to the 
ones mentioned above will therefore be delin­
eated here to recognize seduction. 
Skin feeling is an aspect of seduction about 
which neither the ethnographer nor the inter­
locutor has much control, but which is of the 
utmost importa nce. Liking someone does not 
depend on ideology or social status. Although 
my initial sympathy and tolerance of personal 
idiosyncrasies was greater with members of 
human rights organizations than with the 
armed forces, I soon met officers whose poli­
tics I detested but for whom I felt a personal 
liking, while I talked to human rights activists 

176 ANTONIUS C. G. M. ROBBEN 
whom I admired and whose political views I 
wholehearted ly shared but who had a 
demeanor that made me feel uncomfortable or 
even irritated. Such skin feelings depend in 
part on a countertransferential relation 
between ethnographer and interlocu tor, and in 
part on the dissonance of personalities. My 
awareness could neutralize these feelings and 
reduce their influence on interviews. 
As an- anthropologist without analytical 
training, I learned most about countertra ns­
ference and ethnographic seduction from an 
analysis of recorded interviews. "This inter­
mediary, technologically efficient as a tape 
recorder is, contributes to the containment of 
both the patient's and the therapist's feelings, 
permitting the development of a countertrans­
ference that can be evaluated , (Lira and 
Weinstein, quoted in Bustos 1990:155). Since 
most of my interlocutors were highly visible 
public figures, I gained additional insight from_ 
comparing the interview transcriptions with 
their pronouncements published by the press. 
In research on violent political conflict, one 
anticipates that interlocutors have a stake in 
presenting themselves in the most favorable 
light, in vilifying their opponents, and in trying 
to persuade the ethnographer of their right. 
Just as the psychoanalyst tries to get at the 
truth behind the manifest discourse of the 
analysand, so it is the ethnographer's aim to 
understand the subjectivity of his or her inter­
locutors. The crux of ethnographic seduction 
is not just that it tries to make the ethnogra­
pher accept the discourse uncritically, or that 
it is an attempt to disable the penetration of 
manifest discourse, but that the ethnographer 
either gives in to the manifest discourse or runs 
away from it without inquiring further into its meaning. Rhetoric tries to persuade from the 
outside, seduction from the inside, from the 
transferential relationship that arises between 
the interlocutors. By maneuvering the ethno­
graphic dialogue and countertransference, the 
informant tries to seduce the anthropolog ist 
into accepting his or her discourse as the only 
discourse and as the only correct discourse. 
Seduction aims at either preventing the anthro­
pologist from searching for a latent discourse 
or from thinking that the discourse offered is 
not genuine. 
I do not pass judgment on attempts at seduc­
tion because I understand that a deliberately 
constructed rendition of events and the benefit 
of partisan scholarship may be emotionally, 
politically, and morally important for victims 
and perpetrators of violence. Be this as it may, 
research is not a vehicle for the political 
agendas of our informants and should not be 
steered by the dynamic of our unconscious. 
Awareness of ethnographic seduction does not 
mean that we should simply mistrust, disbe­
lieve, or dismiss the accounts of people who 
have suffered or caused great injustices. On the 
contrary, by not naively accepting people's 
words at face value we demonstrate our pro­
fessional responsibility: first, by trying to sep­
arate discourse from appearance and, second, 
by using those appearances to contextualize 
the discourse under study. The awareness of 
ethnographic seduction aims at/restoring our 
empathetic detachment as ethnographers, dis­
closing concealed areas of cultural knowledge, 
improving our ability to understand discourse 
on its own terms, read its many latent mean­
ings, and represent people's subjective notions, 
experiences, and interpretations in all depth 
and complexity. 

Part IV 
The ''Other'' Talks Back 
] effrey A. Sluka 
Access to schooling and the dissemination of anthropological writings have turned 
once illiterate "informants" into avid critics of their ethnographers. Such "talking 
back;, has made anthropologists aware of their conduct as researchers, led to soul­
searching about their writings, and enhanced the quality of ethnographic research. 
In Part IV we present critical views of anthropology expressed by "others," includ­
ing a native academic (Vine Deloria, Jr.), an indigenous research subject (King), and 
two case studies of ethnographers who faced the wrath of research communities 
that responded powerfully and negatively to newspaper representations of their 
work (Greenberg and Scheper-Hughes). 
Today, many cultural anthropol ogists have had this experience with the press as 
a mediator of their texts, and this is recognized in Caroline Brettell's edited volume 
When They Read What We Write: The Politics of Ethnography (1993). The 
volume's contributors present many and varied examples of "the other" talking 
back, challenging, and criticizing ethnographic works. In her excelJent introduction, 
BrettelJ observes that ethnographers "cannot control how what they put into print 
is read, let alone how it is publicly presented" (1993:17). She describes how anthro­
pologists have responded to criticisms of their writing, and notes that the "others" 
who "talk back" to anthropolo gists generally include three groups of people: 
1 Research participants or those about whom an ethnography is written, includ­
ing both those who have read it and those who have only heard about it sec­
ondhand or read representations of it in newspapers. 
2 lndigenous or native scholars, particularly anthropologists, in the country where 
an ethnography is set. 
3 Journalists or other members of the press and media who write reviews of ethno-
graphic writing. 
Brettell also highlights Renata Rosaldo's identification of three forms of reactions 
by anthropologists when challenged by "native" readers (1993:20-1): First, the 
"Chicken Little Reaction" -they either retreat into hopelessness for the future of 
ethnography , or defend their interpretations and reject the validity of the response. 
Second, the "Two Worlds Reaction" -they emphasize that anthropologists and 
research participants speak two languages, that of science on the one hand and of 

178 PART IV: THE "OTHER" TALKS BACK 
everyday life on the other, and that "never the twain shall meet." Third, the "One 
Conversation Reaction" - they emphasize the new insights that can result from 
listening to native responses, and argue that these often outweigh any misunder­
standings. This reaction usually involves incorporating these responses into the 
original text, frequently as an appendix in a subsequent edition, or presenting them 
in other publications -as the selected readings by Greenberg and Scheper-Hughes 
represent. Brettell also presents Rosaldo' s conclusion that 
We should take the criticism of our subjects in much the same way that we take those 
of our colleagues. Not unlike other ethnographers, so-called natives can be insightful, 
sociologically correct, axe-grinding, self-interested, or mistaken. They do know their 
own cultures, and rather than being ruled out of court, their criticism should be lis­
tened to and taken into account, to be accepted, rejected, or modified, as we refor­
mulate our analysis. (cited in Brettell 1993:16) 
In 1969, Vine Deloria, Jr., a Standing Rock Sioux law student at the University 
of Colorado, published his controversial book Custer Died for Your Sins: An Indian 
Manifesto, in which he severely criticized anthropol ogists for the way they con­
ducted their research with Native Americans. Part of the book is chapter four, 
"Anthropolog ists and Other Friends," on which the selection for this reader was 
based. It is the best known and among the most vehement of criticisms of anthro­
pologists yet written, and begins with the memorable but scathing line "Into each 
life, it is said, some rain must fall ... But Indians have been cursed above all other 
people in history. Indians have anthropologists" (1973:131). While Deloria's cari­
cature of anthropologists is unfair because he overlooks the positive relationships 
anthropol ogists have had with Native Americans, he nevertheless makes important 
points that have not only been supported by many other Native Americans and 
anthropolo gists as well, but are typical of those made by a growing number of Third 
and Fourth World critics on other continents, which also began to emerge about 
the same time. 
Despite the humor of his caricature of anthropol ogists, the message is very serious: 
Anthropol ogists have been a curse on Native Americans; they treat people as 
objects for observation, experimentation, manipulation, and "eventual extinction" 
(1973:132); and they are a greater threat to their existence than the US Cavalry ever 
was. In the book-length version, he adds "Thus has it ever been with anthropolo­
gists. In believing they could find the key to man's behavior , they have, like the 
churches, become forerunners of destruction" (1988:100). He concludes by warning 
anthropolo gists that "a new day is coming," and he advises us "to get down off 
[our] thrones of authority and ... begin helping Indian tribes instead of preying on 
them" (1973:137). In particular , Deloria insisted that the "compilation of useless 
knowledge for knowledge's sake should be utterly rejected by the Indian people. We 
should not be objects of observation for those who do nothing to help us" 
(1973:136). Instead, he called for a new relationship between anthropo logists and 
Native Americans based on reciprocity and Indian needs, and a redistribution of 
power in research relationships. 
How Deloria's message has been interpreted and misinterpreted is explored in 
Indians and Anthropologists: Vine Deloria, Jr., and the Critique of Anthropol ogy 
( 1997), edited by Thomas Biolsi and Larry Zimmerman. In their introduction to 

INTRODUCTlON 179 
the volume, Biolsi and Zimmerman observe that long before most anthropo logists 
had heard of Michel Foucault or Pierre Bourclieu, 
Deloria had put his finger directly on what would later be called discursive formations, 
symbolic capital, and the micropolitics of the academy. Deloria asked, regarding Indian 
peoples, "Why should we continue to be the private zoos for anthropologists? Why 
should tribes have to compete with scholars for funds when the scholarly productions 
are so useless and irrelevant to real life"? (1997:4} 
While part of Deloria's agenda was an attempt to deter anthropologists from 
further "meddling" with :Native American commun ities, he did not reject the value 
of anthropology -only how anthropologists had acted; he respected anthropolog­
ical research, as long as it was put at the service of Indian communities, and he 
had a major impact on the discipline as a whole. In "Growing up on Deloria,'}, 
Elizabeth Grobsmith (1997) discusses the impact his work had on a generation of 
anthropologists: 
He [imposed] a test on us - a new standard, which those of us who would persevere 
had to meet. Custer Died for Your Sins became our primer for how not to behave, con­
juring up the ultimate image of the tiresome meddler we dreaded and desperately hoped 
to avoid. It made us defensive, in the true sense of the term: we continually had to 
defend and justify our existence and practice self-reflection and introspection -tasks 
of self-evaluation critical to good social science. We would not advocate outside control 
or be party to schemes of exploitation, top-down development, or paternalistic impo­
sition; rather, we applauded ... self-determ ination policies and attitudes ... and saw 
our role as facilitating indigenously defined agendas. (1997:36-7) 
She argues this led to "a different breed of researchers" and helped moved us toward 
research relationships based on mutual reward or reciprocity (1997:47). 
Deloria's and King's articles represent typical examples of the growing wave of 
criticism from Third and Fourth World research participants that led to the "rein­
vention" and "decolonization" of anthropology in the postmodern era. The publi­
cation of Deloria's book in 1969 inaugurated a new period in relations between 
American Indian people and anthropologists, and Deloria and King are typical of 
many other indigenous scholars around the world who have also articulated grave 
concerns about how anthropo logists have represented them. 
Cecil King's short article is in the spirit of Deloria and other indigenous critics of 
anthropol ogy, and is the only article in this reader which is not by an anthropolo­
gist. We have included it because in a section devoted to ''the other talks back" we 
thought we should include at least one unmitigated example. King, a member of 
the Odawa people from Manitoulin Island, Ontario, and professor of Education 
and Director of the Ontario Aboriginal Teacher Education Program at Queens Uni­
versity, expresses the all too common refrain about anthropologists: 
We, as Indian people, have welcomed strangers into our midst. We have welcomed all 
who came with intellectual curiosity or in the guise of the informed student. We have 
honored those whom we have seen grow in their knowledge and understanding of our 
ways. But unfortunately, many times we have been betrayed. Our honored guests have 
shown themselves to be no more than peeping toms, rank opportunists, interested in 
furthering their own careers by trading in our sacred traditions. Many of our people 

180 PART IV: THE "OTHER" TALKS BACK 
have felt anger at the way our communities have been cheated, held up to ridicule, and 
our customs sensationalized. Singer Floyd Westerman (Dakota ), for example, expressed 
his anger in his 1969 recording "Here Come the Anthros." (1997:115) 
Like other indigenous voices "speaking back" to anthropologists, King combines 
his criticism with a demand for reciprocity - a call for anthropologists to "become 
instrumental to our ambitions, our categories of importance" (1997:117) -with a 
demand for a redistribution of power in the traditional (empiricist) research 
relationship: 
We want to escape from the zoo. We want to be consulted and respected as not only 
human beings, at the very least, but as independent nations with the right to determine 
what transpires within our boundaries. We want to say who comes to our world, what 
they should see, hear, and take away. Most important, we want to appraise, critique, 
and censure wha.t they feel they have a right to say about us. (1997:118; emphasis 
added) 
After Ofra Greenberg's ethnography of an Israeli border communit y, where she 
had lived and conducted research for five years, was published in 1989, a journalist 
wrote a review for a small local newspaper which Greenberg says "grossly distorted 
facts and displayed a complete misunderstanding of the book's contents. According 
to this journalist, the people of Kiryat Shmona were depicted by me in a venomous 
manner, as being cruel and generally obnoxious" (1993:108). The story took some 
quotations from the book out of context, distorted others and made some up, and 
portrayed the anthropologist 
as an arrogant, privileged individual who observes the "natives" from a superior view­
point, "like the traditional European anthropologists who investigated the native 
Africans, and who enjoys describing their backward and cruel world." She emphasized 
my affiliation with the veteran sector of Israeli society, my European origins, -my sec­
ularity, and my academic education, and underscored the extent to which these attrib­
utes make me quite different from the people I studied. It was thus easy to characterize 
me as a European colonialist, invading �e lives of the natives out of sheer curiosity. 
(1993:109) 
When the article came to the attention of the people of Kiryat Shmona, they reacted 
angrily, even though they had not actually seen or read the book. There was a public 
furor, and Greenberg was attacked in the local newspaper and received numerous 
complaints and other negative reactions. In this article, she describes and analyzes 
the commun ity's reactions to the book, stressing the role of the press in mediating 
the reading of her book and defining the anthropo logist/ethnographer as a foreigner 
and outsider. 
Greenberg was accused of superiority and condescension. Community people who 
read the newspaper article but not the book felt compelled to respond, and politi­
cians took advantage of the situation to advance their own agendas. In her article, 
Greenberg emphasizes the multiplicity of respo�ses that emerge from a diverse group 
of readers, especially when they are responding not to the actual text but to its 
(mis)representation in the press. The reactions were both direct and indirect, and 
both critical and supportive. She received telephone calls and letters, both negative 

INTRODUCTION 181 
and positive, and wrote a letter to the newspaper countering the original article. 
The controversy was picked up by a national newspaper, and Greenberg had to 
defend herself in the press at that level as well. 
Greenberg's main point is that the newspapers played the leading role in shaping 
the public response to the book -in "influencing what happens when the people 
we write about read what we write" (1993: 117). While a few people did read the 
book in order to form their own opinion, "the great majority of the public relied 
solely on information gathered from newspapers and formed their opinions on that 
basis" (1993:114). This is of critical importance, because it suggests that even today, 
when research participants themselves are nearly always literate, they still relatively 
rarely actually read what anthropolo gists write about them, and they are far more 
likely to gain their knowledge of what has been written about them from media 
reports of it. It seems ironic that most of Kiryat Shmona' s residents "would not have 
learned about the book's publication had it not been for the appearance of the 
[newspaper] article" (1993:116). 
Like Greenberg's case, the furor over Nancy Scheper-Hughes' ethnography about 
mental health in an Irish village was sparked by an article published in a newspaper. 
Scheper-Hughes conducted fieldwork in "Ballybran" in 1974, and in 1979 published 
her award-winning ethnography Saints, Scholars, and Schizophrenics: Mental Illness 
in Rural Ireland. In 1980, Michael Viney, a columnist from the Irish Times, visited 
"Ballybran" and wrote an article about the local anger he experienced in reaction 
. to the book: "Since the publication last year, two or three copies of the book have 
been passing from house to house, hurt and anger flaring up like a gunpowder trail. 
The preface begs pardon 'for exposing the darker and weaker side of their venera­
ble culture.' It seems unlikely to be granted" (Viney 1980:12). Like Greenberg, 
Scheper-Hughes responded by writing a "Reply to 'Ballybran' " (1981) for the Irish 
Times, defending the book. While she accepted that it may have caused a "diffuse 
and collective hurt experienced by members of a community that may view itself as 
betrayed,'' she denied that it should have caused individual hurt because she had 
only betrayed commonly known "communi ty secrets" and no personal or family 
ones. Nonetheless, Scheper-Hughes exposed what people of "Ballybran'' preferred 
not to have been exposed, and, in their words, "created a public shame" 
( 1981:9-1 0). 
In 1999, 20 years after the book was published, Scheper-Hughes finally returned 
to "Ballybran" and attempted to reconcile herself with the community by apolo­
gizing for any unintentional hurt given. But in this she failed; the trip ended with 
her "expulsion" from the village, and she concludes that she had created a new cat­
egory of "unwanted people" in the village-"that new species of traitor and friend, 
the anthropologist" (1995:136). 
Brettell's conclusions concerning fieldwork, text, and audience -or "when they 
read what we write" -provide a succinct summary of the situation today: It is 
inevitable that anthropological texts will be read, in one way or another, by those 
in the community studied; these are the greatest critics, followed by those closely 
associated or identified with those people -native scholars and other elites 
(1993:22). Issues of identity and representation will always be at stake, and anthro­
pologists today are aware that the texts they write will increasingly be read and 
contested. Drawing attention to the politics of ethnographic writing, particularly 
the impact of the audience (readers) on both the anthropologist and text, has raised

theoreti cal, ethical, and practical questions for anthropologists who will increas­
ingly be confronted by research participants who read and react. Consideration of 
cases of when "the other talks back" have helped us to move toward increased 
sensitivity and "new ways to involve our ethnographic subjects in their self­
representation " ( 19 9 3:22).
