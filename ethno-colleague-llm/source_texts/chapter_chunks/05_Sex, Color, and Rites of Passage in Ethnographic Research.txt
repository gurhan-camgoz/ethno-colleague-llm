Sex, Color, and Rites of 
Passage in Ethnographic 
Research 
Norris Brock Johnson 
Arnold van Gennep remains an important · 
figure primarily because of his seminal ap­
proach to defining the relationship of ritual 
behavior to the dynamics of both individual 
and group life.1 Van Gennep (1960) suggests 
that the life of any individual or group ought 
to be conceptualized as a series of transitions, 
deriving clarity and meaning through their 
dramatic expression in ritual ceremony. The 
ritual ceremonies marking off periods of tran­
sition from one stage or aspect of life to 
another are composed of sequenced events and 
activities collectively termed rites de passage. 
In discussing rites of passage in a variety of cul­
tures, van Gennep delineates the now-f amiliar 
typological distinction between pre/imina/ rites 
of separation, liminal rites of transition, and 
post/imina/ rites of incorporation. 
Van Gennep's notion of rite de passage is 
useful to our detecting and understanding the 
latent patterning of the experiences we may 
encounter during the process of ethnographic 
research.2 On one level ethnographic research 
itself is a series of rite-of-passage transitions. 
The researcher is first separated, often psycho­
JogicaJly as well as geographically , from his or 
her native culture. Existing in a liminal state, 
separated from his own culture yet not incor-porated into the host culture, the ethnographer 
becomes what van Gennep, and more recently 
Agar (1980), would term a stranger. Accord­
ing to van Gennep (1960:28), the way out of 
liminal stages takes on an invariant pattern 
and sequence: 
The length and intricacy of each stage through 
which foreigners and natives move toward 
each other varies with different people. The 
basic procedure is always the same, however, 
for a company or an individual: they must 
stop, wait, go through a transitional period, 
enter and be incorporated. 
Just being deposited on shore and pitching a 
tent, as did Malinowski, does not mean that 
one will gain meaningful access to the group 
under study. An ethnographe r's degree of 
access to another culture often is associated 
with his degree of incorporation into the group 
or subgroup under study. Until being granted 
appropriate rite-of-passage experiences, the 
field researcher might remain in that terrible 
liminal stranger state with which most ethno­
graphers are familiar. And this is of conse­
quence, as there is another level on which to 
consider ethnographic research as rite of 
passage.

SEX, COLOR, AND-RITES OF PASSAGE IN ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH 77 
In the Boasian tradition, becoming a cultural 
anthropologist requires successfully "passing" 
a ritual sequence of research experiences as a 
precondition of professional status and role. 
Through these often dramatic experiences, the 
novitiate is transformed into a new being -
a cultural anthropologist. 3 Much has been 
written, often in anecdotal fashion, about 
the transformation effect of the experience of 
ethnographic research. The analogy, though, 
has been treated superficially. The rite-of­
passage form of these transformational expe­
riences has been little explored. To be valid, 
the rite-of-passage analogy ought also to be 
thought of in terms of the invariate sequence 
of events one experiences in the process of 
status/role transformation. More attention 
needs to be directed to the structure and sequ­
ence of ethnographic experiences as part of the 
required passage into anthropologydom. 
This article illustrates the useful applica­
tion of van Gennep's typological concern with 
sequence and form to our understanding of the 
. nature of ethnographic research. Apart from 
merely serving to transform one into a cultural 
anthropologist, what aspects of ethnographic 
research correspond, or do not correspond, to 
classic rite-of-passage theory? Conversely, can 
our understanding of ethnographic research 
add to rite-of-passage theory? 
The color, sex, and host group basis for 
interpretations of the stranger are important 
factors not taken into account by van Gennep. 
Indeed, van Gennep assumes that wayfaring 
strangers invariably are white males. Van 
Gennep is not particularly racist or sexist; such 
assumptions were common in early ethnol­
ogy.4 This paper discusses the impact of color, 
sex, and gender expectations on liminal rites 
of transition by contrasting two instances of 
ethnographic research: my research in a rural 
village in the midwestern United States, and 
my research on a small island in the British 
West Indies.5 In the West Indies I sought access 
to a strictly male carpentry and boatbuilding 
group. In the United States, I sought access 
to a predominately female schoolteacher host 
group. I found van Gennep useful for under­
standing the structure and meaning of some 
seemingly random ethnographic experiences. I 
came to the conclusion that rite-of-passage 
events and activities, the kind and degree of transition out of the liminal phase of ethno­
graphic research, vary with respect to the color 
and sex of the stranger and associated expec­
tations within host groups. I use van Gennep's 
sequence of stopping, waiting, transition, and 
entry to compare similarities and differences 
in the rites-of-passage events and activities 
leading to varying degrees of access to these 
two host groups. 
This little-used typology better depicts the 
form and sequence of rite-of-passage transi­
tions into ethnographic experiences than does 
the more familiar separation/transition/in­
corporation sequence more accurately describ­
ing rites of passage into the status and role of 
professional anthropologist. The stopping/ 
waiting/transition/entry sequence is a subdivi­
sion of the liminal transition period within the 
separationltransition/incorpora tion sequence. 6 
The color and sex of the stranger, and the 
judgments about the stranger made by host 
groups, affect the character of the pattern by 
which each moves toward, or away from, the 
other. Given this, some strategies found useful 
for reducing the time spent in the liminal 
stranger stage are discussed in the conclusion. 
Accompanied by these color and sex consider­
ations. van Gennep presents a useful guide to 
the sequencing of experiences one might 
expect to encounter during the process of 
ethnographic research. 
On the Island of Bequia 
(Beck-We) 
The island of Bequia nestles in the northern 
part of the Grenadines, a lush string of 32 
small islands covering the 65 km between Saint 
Vincent to the north and Grenada to the south, 
in the windward archipelago of the Lesser 
Antilles of the British West Indies. With a pop­
ulation of 4,236, Bequia is three km wide and 
eight km long. 
During the midsummer of 1980 I arrived by 
cargo boat to begin a two-month pilot survey 
of existing boatbuilding activities on several 
islands in the West Indies. My large interest 
is in better understanding the relationship 
between ideas, values, and feelings, and the 
manner in which that ideological realm is given 
existence� and permanence, through material 

78 NORRIS BROCK JOHNSON 
objects and artifacts. We human beings are 
affected by the environments we create for our­
selves. Culture, as a human phenomenon, is 
something we live through as well as something 
we bring into being. Through our interactions 
with them, the things we create, buildings for 
example, help condition us to the values, ideas, 
and meanings clustered in the ideological realm 
of culture (cf. Bourdieu 1973; Csikszentmiha­
lyi and Rochberg-Halton 1981; Oliver 1975). 
But humans inhabit maritime as well as terres­
trial environments, and we have not paid as 
much attention to the cultural consideration of 
the things we create in adapting to the water 
as we have to the things we create in adapting 
to the land. My interest in boats springs from 
the observation that, unlike the ethnographic 
analysis of buildings (cf. Crowhurst-Lennard 
1979; Fernandez 1977; Paul 1976), boats are 
assumed to be purely functional forms. Boats 
look the way they do, many conclude� because 
they function to move people and goods 
through the water. Many assume that, unlike a 
Gothic cathedral (Panofsky 1957} or a Maori 
marae (Austin 1976), maritime architecture 
embodies no subtle iconographic form or 
sophisticated symbolic structure. But boats, 
especially traditional wooden boats, are 
material artifacts permitting prolonged inter­
action with water and air, and anyone who has 
spent any time sailing has been aware of the 
powerful (mostly spiritual) archetypal feelings 
and thoughts engendered thro�gh this unique 
combination of elements (wood/eanh; air/ 
water). So my ongoing concern is with 
researching how traditional wooden boats 
exhibit noninstrumental form, and how boats 
embody culture to the extent that interactions 
with and experiences through these forms ori­
entate one to ideas, values, and meanings at 
work in other spheres of the societies produc­
ing them. 
Much research on maritime anthropology 
has been carried out in the Pacific basin; by 
comparison, seafaring traditions in the 
Caribbean have been neglected. 7 Through 
word of mouth from other sailors and through 
replies to letters about my project placed in 
sailing magazines, I found out that "the best 
boats in the Caribbean are built in the West 
Indies, and the best boats in the West Indies 
are built in the Grenadines." Bequia 's subsis-tence strategy and culture have long been tied 
to the sea. My survey of Bequia, Carriacou, 
Canouan, and Petit Martinique would reveal 
an island on which to focus long-term ethno­
graphic research. Further, I came to the 
Grenadines to find a society where traditional 
wooden boats are still an integral part of the 
culture, and to locate shipwrights (to whom I 
might apprentice myself in a long-term eth­
nographic study) still using traditional 
methods of boatbuilding and exhibiting little 
or no modern European and North American 
influences on design construction, technique, 
or symbolic meaning. 
Stopping 
Van Gennep says that the stranger, seeking 
access to a host group, initially will be 
stopped. Upon jumping off the roof of a cargo 
boat onto Bequia, I found this to be true -lit­
erally. As a stranger, I arrived on Bequia at a 
most inopportune time. The duration of my 
stopping period, I feel, was influenced by my 
age, my sex, and my color. 
There recently had been a short-lived 
Marxist revolution on nearby Grenada, and a 
short-lived armed conflict on Bequia itself. I 
arrived amid nighttime political rallies illumi­
nated by flickering torchlight, amid men, silent 
behind their black sunglasses, wearing green 
fatigues and carrying glistening blue automatic 
weapons. The guards were from Saint Vincent, 
the adminis trative center for the Grenadines. 
Upon arrival I was not asked for my passport 
or other papers, but I was watched. At the 
small guest house in which I initially settled, I 
soon found it made little difference to intro­
duce myself as a university professor from the 
United States interested only in learning about 
traditional boatbuilding. My feeling, though 
hard to prove, is that I was viewed by a variety 
of people as a strange black male asking 
questions. My initial attempts to make con­
versation with the cooks and waitresses, the 
fishermen on the wharfs, and the owners of the 
guest house all met with short replies followed 
by silence, so I stopped trying. About five days 
passed before people began volunteering infor­
mation about fishing, sailing, and boats, and 
about the shipwrights on the island. I became 
nervous as the first week drew to a close. Did 

SEX, COLOR, AND RITES OF PASSAGE IN ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH 79 
I look that much like a revolutionary? The 
mental picture of a "revolutionary," I gath­
ered, did not include white males or women. 
The armed men with the sunglasses did not 
appear to scan the few white tourists (cameras, 
shorts, smiling, always in a group) as closely 
as they scanned me (cut-off sweatshirt and 
jeans, sandals, beard, not smiling, alone, 
black, adult, male). I believe my stopping 
period would have been shorter if I had been 
a white male, a white female, or a black 
female. I was stopped until people made their 
decisions about my motives and intent. During 
this period, I remained visible and did not talk 
about anything except boats and sailing. But 
one morning at breakfast my hostess casually 
mentioned that there were two men with 
whom I ought to speak. Apparently she had 
decided that I was who and what I said I was, 
and she was willing to help me proceed with 
my study. There are many shipwrights on the 
island, she said, but these two men are "older" 
(in their seventies) and are "the best." I made 
a mental note to find out what made them "the 
best." This week-long stopping phase told me 
that shipwrights are held in an esteem high 
enough for them to be either consciously or 
unconsciously guarded by others. When I ini­
tially met with each shipwright I was not sur­
prised that they expected my visit. 
Waiting 
While on Bequia I divided my time more or 
less equally between the two shipwrights to 
whom I had been referred. For illustrative pur­
poses, though, I will narrate the process by 
which my liminal stranger phase was short­
ened with only one of them. The man to whom 
I will refer as Mr Atkins is descended from 
the Carib Indians aboriginal to these islands. 
Tall, ruddy, and taut even in his seventies, he 
has been a shipwright all his life. He learned 
to build sea vessels from his father. No longer 
working for himself, for the last several years 
he has been employed in a small boatyard 
most recently owned by a young, white male 
American from California. I had previously 
seen the old man laboring in the boatyard, 
but did not realize that he was one of the 
persons I had traveled over 3,000 km hoping 
to find. The phase of my relationship with Mr 
Atkins I classify as the waiting period of my 
passage lasted almost two weeks. During that 
time I visited daily the boatyard in which he 
worked. More precisely, the area in which he 
worked was a yard with boats being built in 
it. The work area borders the beach, and is 
sheltered by palms and other trees. A six-by­
nine-meter shed is nestled among the trees. The 
shed is framed with wood posts and covered 
with corrugated aluminum panels, leaving the 
front wall open. Inside is a dry area for storing 
important woods, a place for tool storage, 
several large work benches, and small hollows 
near the walls where the men sit to take their 
lunch. Boats are built on the sand between the 
shed and the bay. Work in the boatyard started 
early in the morning, and I was often up and 
out at first light. Both directly with words 
and indirectly with side glances and studied 
reserve, Mr Atkins told me he wanted to know 
why I had come to see him. I felt him testing 
me. Could he trust and respect me? Did I trust 
and respect him? Our conversations kept 
coming back to boats. It seemed important for 
him to know how much I knew about boats. 
I gradually came to feel he was concerned with 
what kind of "man" I was; with whether or 
not I was to be respected, by his unfolding cri­
teria, as a "man." 
I came to this conclusion indirectly. We did 
not actually talk about what makes some 
males "men" and others not. I saw that ship­
wrights were held in high esteem by other men, 
as well as by women. Women proudly told me 
that a male relative "used to build boats." The 
woman in charge of my guest house had an 
uncle who was a captain on one of the cargo 
boats running between the islands. Rather 
than talking about themselves and their occu­
pations, other men talked to me about the 
shipwrights they knew. In almost every seafar­
ing culture, the making and sailing of water 
craft are confined to males in general and to 
high status males in particular (cf. Gladwin 
1970; Lewis 1978; Malinowski 1922; Procope 
1955; Wilbert 1976). I found this also to be 
the case on Bequia. Males work with tools to 
build vessels to carry people and goods across 
the sea. Males manipulate natural elements 
and bring them under human control. So quite 
consciously I sought to exhibit my passing 

80 NORRIS BROCK JOHNSON 
acquaintance with knowledge I knew tradi­
tionally was privy to high status shipwrights 
on the island. I felt that making a reputation, 
as Wilson (1973} terms it, as a man-of-the-sea 
would make my relationship with Mr Atkins 
more intimate and aid my entry into this group 
of people. 
For one thing, being a high-sta tus male on 
Bequia means not only knowing about ships, 
the sea, and sailing, but it also means being 
expected to know about hand-and-eye . Those 
males reading this article who are not familiar 
with hand-and-eye would not be seen as very 
masculine by the male shipwright subgroup on 
the island of Bequia. The analogy here is with 
being male in the United States and not being 
employed - one is simply not a "man." I ini­
tially came to know about "hand and eye" 
quite by accident, but it proved to be a key to 
my gaining deeper access to the shipwright 
subgroup. I take pains to describe hand-and­
eye so as to convey what only a few males on 
Bequia traditionally came to understand and 
so in becoming a master shipwright and, so to 
speak, a man among men. 
If you passed by Mr Atkins working in the 
boatyard on Bequia, you probably would not 
be aware that his is the most important con­
struction task in the yard. For the last ten years 
or so, Mr Atkins's work has involved carving 
a series of curved ribs of various lengths from 
cedar tree limbs to be used as the framework 
for boats built in the yard. This work is termed 
"timbering" and is the most prestigious task in 
the yard. Only Mr Atkins carves timbers. The 
other men in the yard told me that if the 
timbers (the frames) are not "right," the 
"form" of the boat as a whole will not be 
"right." I remember them looking at me as a 
not-very-significant person for not knowing 
this. Then one day while he was working, I 
bluntly told Mr Atkins I knew he was build­
ing by hand-and-eye. He looked up from his 
work. I felt he was really looking at me as a 
person of significance (as a "man") for the first 
time. I felt respect. The significance, the recog­
nition given by Mr Atkins, stemmed from this 
stranger knowing about hand-and-eye. 
Building by "eye" means that no elaborate 
plans or drawings are used in the design of a 
boat. In the contemporary United States, for 
example, the frames ("timbers") of wooden boats customarily are built from a series of 
full-size drawings in the case of smaller boats, 
and scale-reduced drawings in the case of 
boats larger than about 15 meters. Mr Atkins 
had to learn to build boats not as they pre­
liminarily existed on paper, but as they pre­
liminarily existed in his mind's "eye." Mr 
Atkins is both designer and builder. This con­
ceptual feat separated, so to speak, the men 
from the males. Getting form "right" involves 
laying out the keel and then putting up a bow 
(front), beam (middle), and stem (end) frame. 
Most times, the bow and stem frames are the 
same. Then long, thin lengths of wood, one to 
a side, are placed end to end near the gunwales 
(top of the frames). The shipwright then moves 
around this five-piece frame, looking at rela­
tionships. If not satisfied, an assistant moves 
one of the frames slightly forward or back­
ward, altering the shape of the stringer repre­
senting the shape of the hull. When satisfied, 
other stringers are added. Sometimes the trial 
frames are chiseled away, or new ones substi­
tuted, to get the desired "form." This goes on 
for several days, for longer boats, until the 
"right" frames are selected and their positions 
marked on the keel. The stringers are removed, 
secondary frames added, and the boat takes 
shape. Each and every boat, no matter the size, 
is built in this fashion. For several months I 
watched the other shipwright I interviewed 
building a 25-meter schooner from an initial 
rough sketch he had made on the sand. These 
men had to learn to design and build boats in 
terms of part-to-whole relationships rather 
than in terms of standardized preset plans - no 
mean feat. Presumably, not aU the males who 
try can achieve it; those who do are held in 
high esteem. Further, boats are designed not 
just in terms of internal form, but also with 
respect to knowledge of local sea conditions 
and the intended use of each boat. One must 
also think of the influence of the environment 
in which each boat will function. 
Building by "hand" means that no electrical 
power tools or heavy mechanical equipment 
are used in the construction of boats. At the 
time of my visit, most of Petit Martinique did 
not have electricity. The power generating 
plant" on Bequia is a recent acquisition, and 
was the focus of a sabotage effort by nation­
alistic guerillas from Grenada. When used in 

SEX, COLOR, AND RITES OF PASSAG E IN ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH 81 
remote areas, electrical power is provided by 
gasoline generators. Still, fairly large boats are 
built by only a few men using an adze (or, more 
recently, a hatchet), several hand planes, a 
twist drill, a string plumb, and a two�person 
tree saw. My second informant is not using 
any power tools to build his 25-meter cargo 
schooner. I helped him and his two sons lift 
4 x 8-meter slabs of imported worm-resistant 
silver bali planking &om Guyana up onto 
cedar frames as thick as my waist. 8 All the 
hundreds of holes for the planking bolts 
(wooden in more traditional vessels) are drilled 
by hand. In part, the physical strength involved 
accounts for boatbuilding as a primarily 
male activity. Being able to build boats by 
hand-and-eye in the West Indies is the achieve­
ment of only a few high starus males. 
During this waiting period I remember 
feeling quite like a child trying to get a father's 
attention; one male seeking the approval of a 
higher ranking male. I knew I was in a waiting 
period, and so I consciously tried to show the 
shipwrights and other men in the boatyard 
that I too knew something about carpentry, 
tools, boats, and sailing. I too knew about 
hand-and-eye, a traditional system that has 
all but died out. I wanted Mr Atkins to see 
that, though a stranger, in more vital respects 
I was much like him. I wanted him to know I 
loved and respected the knowledge and skills 
he knew, loved, and respected. So over the 
ensuing weeks I sought to convey that I had 
come to Bequia not just to know these things, 
but to know more about these things. I knew 
about building by eye, but I did not under­
stand how one could just look at something as 
complicated as a boat's hull and see that it was 
"right." What was "right" and what was 
"wrong'' about a hull's form? How does one 
come to know and remember these things? I 
felt I was worthy to know more because of the 
effort I had made, on my own, to acquire 
partial knowledge. I wanted Mr Atkins to see 
me, by local standards, as a man among men. 
Otherwise, I could not proceed, as the knowl­
edge I sought was too intricately connected 
with gender expectations. 
But all of this is quite circumstantial. In 
another setting, if the information I sought 
were linked to expectations emphasizing 
males efficiently consuming large amounts of alcohol, I would most definitely flunk any rites 
of passage extended to me! But on Bequia 
my initial display of knowledge about, skill at, 
and interest in boatbuilding and sailing were 
instrumental in commanding trust and respect 
from among the shipwrights. I feel it was for 
these reasons alone that, over the ensuing 
weeks of the waiting period, I was subtly 
invited to enter into a more intimate relation­
ship with Mr Atkins. 
Transition 
I clearly recall the key event terminating the 
liminal stranger phase of my passage. One 
morning I went down to the small boatyard at 
the end of Port Elizabeth, the main village on 
Bequia, to watch Mr Atkins work on timber­
ing. Day in and day out, his main task was to 
use a hatchet and adze to shape tree limbs into 
timbers. I had been interviewing him about 
traditional boatbuilding techniques. On the 
beach in front of the yard, tied to a palm tree 
gracefully bent out over the water, were two 
very lovely 5-meter open-deck sailing boats. 
These craft are made in the yard and are used 
by men to hunt whales, by boys to deliver 
goods to yachts in the harbor, and by other 
males as a way to get around the island. The 
yard owner also makes these boats to sell to 
tourists. I never saw a female sailing one of 
these craft. Mr Atkins used these boats to 
point out to me traditional building materials 
and techniques. I made a series of drawings 
of the craft and spent a considerable amount 
of time trying to understand the intricacies of 
their hand-and-eye method of construction. 
The boats are constructed like fine furniture. I 
could find no nails anywhere in the boat; water 
pins, what we call dowel rods, are used to hold 
the craft together. The cedar and spruce pine 
decking is sealed with varnish and hand pol� 
ished to a mirror shine. My admiration of 
these small craft, shaped and painted green like 
open pea -pods, is never ending. 
That morning Mr Atkins asked if I could sail 
them. I immediately understood the test, and 
understood the compliment in being asked if I 
wanted to be tested. I was being invited to 
make a transition. Not all the males on Bequia 
are so invited. I was scared! These small boats 
were like nothing I had previously seen or 

82 NOR�S BROCK JOHNSON 
sailed. What if I swamped the boat and failed? 
And what did "fail" mean? I knew that if I did 
not sail the boat I would be as one of those 
hollow men of which T. S. Eliot spoke; "all 
show and no go," so to speak. "Men" sailed 
boats as well as built them. If I failed to sail 
the boat, in their eyes I would be seen as 
knowing something about carpentry, but not 
as being a more fully competent "man of the 
sea" like them. But I wasn't trying to be one 
of them!9 I was just trying to get them to 
respect me enough to share deeper levels of 
knowledge about boatbuilding. But the rules I 
was learning said that this is a "man's" world. 
One does not cast pearls before swine. If I 
failed I knew I would go back to the waiting 
stage, or I might be stopped again. I felt excite­
ment at the thought of sailing a craft I admired 
greatly. I also knew that Mr Atkins knew 
this about me. These men, these shipwrights, , 
deeply love boats. Perhaps this was the other 
reason I had been invited to sail. This last 
thought nurtured confidence. I knew Mr 
Atkins was giving me, in Mauss' ( 1967) sense 
of the term, a gift - an invitation to share 
knowledge and experience and to form a 
deeper bond. Van Gennep (1960:29) mentions 
offerings and gift-giving as acts whereby host 
groups extend themselves to strangers. Among 
this male shipwright group, a valued offering 
and gift was the invitation to sail a boat they 
had made. 
I could not ask how to sail the boat. During 
my stay on Bequia I never saw one man ask 
another man anything about boats. Men dis­
cussed boats as equals. But I did ask for help 
in pushing the 275 kgm boat into the water! I 
headed upwind ... and immediately almost 
capsized the boat. The boat is comparatively 
light, and does not have a long, deep, stabiliz­
ing keel. The slightest breeze wildly tipped us 
as I wobbled out to Admiralty Bay. I felt I 
could hear the men in the yard laughing, but 
laughing with me rather than at me. I used my 
weight to counter the heeling of the boat. 
It is important to note that every part of the 
boat is organic and made by men. The sheets 
(ropes used to control the cotton duck sails) 
are woven (by men) on the island. Sails are 
made (by men) down the street from the guest 
house in which I stayed. The mast is polished 
bamboo gathered (by men) from upland parts of the island. I knew the men who built this 
boat think of themselves, and are thought of, 
as a class apart. I was initially not on Bequia 
long enough to note the actual hierarchy in 
which these men rank themselves, but I do 
know that their male status hierarchy corre­
sponds to the part of the boat each built. The 
keel and frames are considered the most 
important parts of the boat; they are made 
by the most important shipwright. Sails are 
important and sailmakers are high status 
males. The making of shrouds, the making and 
polishing of deck parts, and painting the hull 
are lower status activities, as these pieces are 
not considered central to what a boat is. The 
"boat" is considered to be the keel, frame, and 
hull, "finished off" by these secondary activi­
ties. In a subtle manner the physical form of a 
boat concretizes male status relationships, and 
links material culture to ideology and social 
organization. 
But I was getting the feel of the boat. 
Growing confident and wanting to show off for 
the men in the yard (I later learned they had 
gone back to work and were not watching me), 
I wove in and out of the tourist yachts parked 
in the water like fiberglass space ships. Easing 
out the sails, I turned away from the wind and 
let it blow me back to the yard. I let down the 
sails and coasted onto the beach. Seeing me, 
several of the yard men stopped work to help 
pull me in. They told me I had been out for 
about 20 minutes. It seemed like half a day. 
Everybody laughed and kidded me about the 
way I had wobbled out to sea. Several men 
patted me on the back; I was making contact, 
and I felt great! Mr Atkins did not stop his 
work, but just looked up at me and gently 
smiled. The smile said I had passed. I would 
take the boat out again at various times, but 
that first time was a definite transition.10 After 
that event, I noticed several important changes 
in the behavior of Mr Atkins and the other men 
toward me. 
Entry 
Mr Atkins began asking me to help him 
around the yard. I was not permitted to work 
·on the boats themselves, but I was periodically 
asked to help rough out some of the cedar 
limbs and tree trunks used in making the 

r SEX, COLOR, AND -RITES OF PASSAGE IN ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH 83 
frames. In carrying and fetching things, I was 
becoming an apprentice. Mr Atkins told me 
that these are initial tasks traditionally done 
by "boys" seeking to learn boatbuilding. Mr 
Atkins had done these things; he said it was 
not something of which I ought to be ashamed. 
The other men knew that it was only some­
thing one had to do in the beginning. More 
importantl y, I was permitted to handle tools 
such as the adze. Not the personal tools owned 
by each man and carefully wrapped in doth 
and taken home at the end of each day, but the 
more crude yard tools kept in the storage shed. 
We did not talk much about tools, but I 
observed that the possession of one's own tools 
is respected among these men. The gender 
expectation is definitely for a "man" to own 
his own tools and be able to use them� In other 
seafaring cultures the possession and handling 
of tools such as these are primarily male activ­
ities (cf. Beck 1973:9). Being permitted access 
to the materials used in building boats, as welJ 
as being permitted to handle the tools associ-
_ated with boatbuilding, I interpreted as fur­
ther gifts being extended to me. I felt I was 
beginning to be incorporated as best a stranger 
could. After initially demonstrating basic 
knowledge and skill, I was told more about 
"hand-and-eye" principles. In talking to Mr 
Atkins about the traditional apprentice system, 
I was also aware that a more complete process 
of incorporation would involve being permit­
ted to work on the boats themselves. 
Other significant changes signaled the oc­
currence of a postliminal transition. The men 
began sharing more of their feelings with me. 
Sitting under the palm trees eating lunch, we 
talked not only about boats but about women 
and sex as well. It seems one must be inter­
ested in women as well as in boats. They began 
asking if I had "found any woman yet." They 
suggested women I might "call upon." Van 
Gennep (1960:34-5) considers the offering of 
women to strangers a prevalent gift (see also 
Pelto 1970:226-7). 
Social relations between males and females 
are polarized. On Bequia task divisions by sex, 
for example, are apparent. During my periodic 
walks to the other side of the island to inter­
view the second shipwright, I continually saw 
females, both women and young girls, out in 
the fields. Females are responsible for tending the fruit trees and garden peas grown both for 
commercial sale and for home use. While 
taking my meals at the guest house, I saw only 
females in the kitchen area preparing and 
serving food. During the day females walk 
back and forth from open-air markets carry­
ing foodstuffs and household goods. During 
my stay on Bequia I never saw a male carry­
ing out these activities, and I never saw a 
female on a boat or in the boatyard except in 
the evenings when women came by, silently, to 
gather cedar chips for firewood. 
After work, the men in the boatyard often 
invited me to sit with them. They often talked 
about the "old days" when they were young 
men building large schooners by hand-and-eye. 
They talked about what life was like on the 
island during the 1940s and 1950s, before the 
influx of tourists. They do not respect most 
of the North American Anglo males they 
encounter who want boats built in a hurry, 
who are not that concerned about "good" 
work, who are not able to recognize "good" 
work in a boat, and do not know, themselves, 
how to bring it into being. It is for this reason 
that they continue hiring local builders. I had 
felt anger about a white male less than half Mr 
Atkins' age owning the boatyard, although he 
knew less about boatbuilding than the resident 
men working for him. In such situations, there 
is some advantage to being a black male. 
Though I spent considerable interview time 
with white residents on Bequia, I spent most 
of my time with black residents. Though a 
stranger, I felt more accepted by blacks than by 
whites. I met and interacted with many white 
tourists who tended to sometimes behave 
toward me as they did to the black male resi­
dents of the island. No matter how much I 
dropped references about my schooling, my 
present position and work, I was not treated as 
simply another North American. I was not 
treated as an equal by people from my native 
culture as much as I was by my host group. 
Other blacks on Bequia stopped paying that 
much attention to me after continually seeing 
me in the company of the shipwrights. Later, I 
would be told that I began looking, to them, 
like any other male from any one of the islands 
(which was the problem in the first place). 
No apprentices work with Mr Atkins. Few 
young men desire to learn boatbuilding. I was 

84 NORRIS BROCK JOHNSON 
told they want to go to Barbados and Trinidad 
"where the money is." The men shared their 
anger about the "whites from the North 
buying up everything around here." Jobs are 
scarce. Most of the men hold part-time car­
pentry jobs. The tradition of hand-and-eye 
boatbuilding in the Grenadines is dying. They 
told me they were grateful I came to begin 
recording how it is done, so that people will 
know. · 
The lesson from Bequia is that passage into 
the shipwright subgroup, though exclusively 
associated with males, involves more than 
simply being male. The shipwrights on Bequia, 
as well as the women with whom I spoke, do 
not see all males as equal. The males connected 
to boats and the sea are respected more and 
held in higher esteem than those who are not 
so connected. For example, my closest friend 
on Bequia is a young man in his mid-twenties 
who works at odd jobs for several tourist 
resorts on the island. He is considerate, 
thoughtful, and supportive -characteristics I 
associate with being a "man." My friend, 
though, continually talks about wanting to be 
in the (mostly British owned) merchant marine 
service, presumably because boats and the sea 
hold considerable power in defining a "real" 
man. Many of his male friends and relatives 
hold high prestige jobs on the cargo boats ser­
vicing the Caribbean. He often says that so­
and-so is "in the service," much as a doting 
mother brags about the accomplishments of 
her children - accomplishments she did not 
achieve. Working in tourist resorts, my friend 
does not feel as "manly" as his male relatives. 
Though linked to males, on Bequia not all 
the males gain access to the shipwright tradi­
tion. Being male is not enough. The gender role 
expectations for this subgroup stipulate that 
one must be a certain type of male to gain 
access. One must love boats, as well as love 
the water. One must want to do this work for 
its own sake. One must be good with one's 
hands, and with tools. I was invited to experi­
ence other activities and bodies of knowledge 
by displaying previous knowledge and skill, as 
well as through the respect I brought to the 
work the shipwrights respected. I was seen as 
a male stranger of some status through an 
initial display of knowledge and interest in 
boats and boatbuilding. For both males and females, my status and subsequent access were 
enhanced simply by being in the company of 
shipwrights. My liminal stranger phase of 
ethnographic research was shortened by a dis­
play of knowledge of, interest and skill in, and 
respect for the gender-specific expectations on 
the island. I feel the waiting period would have 
been much longer had I not displayed this 
knowledge and skill. I am certain that a male 
stranger coming to the island to research syn­
cretist religious traditions prevalent in the area 
would be accorded a lower initial status by the 
males of Bequia. This is not the focus of the 
island's gender expectations. In the "old days'' 
on Bequia when men went out to sea in smaU 
boats to hunt large whales, I suspect it must 
have been very difficult to be a male and be 
afraid of the water, clumsy with one's hands, 
sickened by the smell of woodpiles, and 
unnerved by the howl of the wind. 
In the Village of West 
Haven 
West Haven, comprising 166 sq km and com­
posed of 2, 79 3 people, is a rural village in the 
midwestern United States. During 1974-75 
I carried out ethnographic research in West 
Haven to study the institutions linking small, 
local commun ities to the supralocal social 
and cultural networks comprising large-scale 
industrial state-level societies such as the 
United States. I wanted to develop empirically 
Julian Steward's (1972:43-63) proposition 
that, associated with the development of 
national societies, a group of interrelated insti­
tutions cross-cutting local populations and 
subgroups emerges to bring about functional 
interdependence among those diverse sectors. 11 
I researched public schooling as a mechanism 
for sociocultural transmission in state-level 
societies (Johnson 1980; 1982; 1983). It is not 
by accident that public schooling is presently 
the only national-level institution in which 
all are required to participate (cf. Safa 1971: 
211). Through microethnographic research on 
preschool through twelfth -grade classroom 
culture and society (Johnson 1984), I found 
that schooling conscripts and conditions chil­
dren to participate socially and culturally any­
where in the national system. But similar to 

SEX, COLOR, AND RITES OF PASSAGE IN ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH 85 
initiation and rite-of-passage apparatus in 
other cultures, public schools are limited 
access institutions quite difficult for strangers 
to enter. 
Stopping 
If you ever tried to visit one unannounced, you 
know that public schools, especially elemen­
tary schools, are shrouded in isolation. People, 
including ethnographic researchers, are liter­
ally stopped at the door. The rituals by which 
strangers are permitted into public schools, if 
they are permitted, are both obvious and strin­
gent. In order to enter, one's business must be 
stated to the authorities. One's reasons for 
being in the school and one's credentials as 
parent, researcher, or salesperson (those cus­
tomarily permitted entry) are verified. Whether 
male, female, black or white, every stranger is 
routinely subjected to this entry ritual. 
Public schools, particularly the elementary 
school level on which I will focus, predomi­
nantly are female settings (cf. Dreeben 1968; 
Mayer 1961:3-4, 24-5). Of the 18 elementary 
school teachers at West Haven, only three are 
male. The males teach at the fifth and sixth 
grade level. In these so-called "upper" grades, 
male teachers are associated with the most 
prestigious, "advanced" courses. The ranking 
of the courses reinforces their differenti al 
status. Females teach lower status courses. In 
trying to gain initial access to the classroom, I 
was struck by the fact that males controlled 
entry to the school. To gain entry I first pre­
sented my petition to the school board, making 
a formal request to conduct observational 
research in the school buildings. My role, I 
stressed, was not evaluative; teachers and 
administrators, especially, are sensitive to the 
state evaluations to which they are continually 
subjected. I represented, I said, no agency 
other than myself. Many board members were 
familiar with work I had already completed on 
the history of the commun ity. My request was 
accepted. Then I had to present my case to the 
(white male) superintendent and the building 
principals (black males). The stopping period 
comprised the several days it took to present, 
in the prescribed manner, my petition for entry. 
But each time I entered or left the school I 
had to stop by the principal' s office, near the outside doors, to report my movements. Per­
mission to enter the classrooms was granted, 
in part, because I was by then well known 
in the village and had been ascribed the role 
of ''their" anthropologist. Few academic 
researchers had studied West Haven, I was 
told, and those few were white males or 
females. Remember that on Bequia I had 
received permission to pass on to a group of 
males by a female. At West Haven I received 
permission to pass on to a group of females by 
a male. In gaining access to women through 
men and to men through women, I learned to 
recognize the subtle manner in which differen­
tiated groups are in fact interrelated. 
Both on Bequia and at West Haven, I noticed 
an association between gender role expecta­
tions, spatial segregation by sex, and the social 
distribution of knowledge. On Bequia males 
are associated with boats and the sea; females 
are associated with the land and with food. The 
sexes are also spatially separated. At West 
Haven, the males in the elementary school 
building either are in the principal's office or in 
the custodian's maintenance area. Except for 
the male "upper grade" teachers, all the class­
rooms are occupied by females. The knowledge 
and skills stereotypically associated with either 
sex, as such, exhibit an obvious spatial dis­
tribution. Gaining access to sex- and gender­
linked knowledge about boats on the one hand, 
and classroom life on the other, meant gaining 
access to the specific spatial areas with which 
that knowledge is associated. 
Waiting 
The phase of my relationship with the West 
Haven teachers, especially the female teachers, 
that corresponds to van Gennep's waiting 
period occupied several months in some cases 
and several weeks in others. The process of 
researching classrooms ostensibly controlled 
by females was marked by subtle cross-sex ten­
sions and feelings of distance I did not notice 
in my relationships with the male teachers. The 
female teachers, initialLy, were reserved toward 
me. There was little of the free banter I initially 
experienced with the males, especially with the 
black male teachers. For quite some time there 
were no moves by the female teachers to pass 
me on to more involved levels of relationship. 

86 NORRIS BROCK JOHNSON 
I was kept in van Gennep's liminal state for 
what I remember as a considerable amount of 
time, months in some instances . My feeling 
was that the female teachers reacted to me 
as a black male "stranger," just as people on 
Bequia reacted to me as a black male 
"strang er." The problem was not merely how 
to gain physical entry into the classroom. The 
problem was the significant degree to which 
female teachers kept me at an interacti onal dis­
tance. Then I noticed the importance of color, 
sex, and gender expecta tions in the elementary 
school itself. 
The first clue to the structure of color, sex, 
and gender relationships within the school 
system involved the fact that (mostly white) 
male administrators not only controlled ac­
cess to the education complex, but controlled 
access to the classrooms as well. I initially had 
asked the building principals, not the teachers, 
if I could conduct classroom observations. 
Before entering each classroom, I made a 
formal request to each teacher to do so, and 
all but two teachers accepted. These teachers 
remained unconvinced of my purely academic 
motives, and I believe they felt I might be 
"spying" for the adminis tration or for some 
state evaluation agency. Before letting me into 
a classroom, every teacher asked me where I 
was from, why I was there, and what I was 
going to do. Their suspicion, not so much of 
me but of my role, was obvious. Once in the 
classroom my pattern was to sit, all day, in the 
back of the room taking notes on the events 
and activities I observed. After class there 
� 
would be brief conversation between us, and 
the teacher would leave! This went on for 
some time. I was "in" the classroom yet "out" 
of more involved contact with the teachers. In 
comparison with my experience on Bequia, I 
felt powerless and frustrated. This host group 
of females was not extending itself to me in 
any appreciable way. 
The defensiveness of these female teachers, 
both black and white, toward me was attrib­
utable, in part, to their structural position in 
an environment sometimes not so subtly con­
trolled by males (both black and white). Their 
distance-maintaining effort toward me I inter­
preted as a result of their own color and sex­
role position within the school. Most school building principals are white males. Most 
classroom teachers are female. I began notic­
ing how the female teachers tried to guard 
their classroom spaces from intrusions of one 
sort or another. Indeed, the vast majority of 
intrusions into their classrooms were by males. 
Both black and white male custodians had free 
access, and routinely sauntered unannounced 
into the classrooms, usually while class was in 
session. Many times I watched the principal 
walk into the classroom without knocking, 
with an announ cement, often blithely inter­
rupting the teacher. When this occurred, teach­
ers stood by the door between the visitor and 
the classroom, but to little avail. Putting myself 
in the teacher's shoes, I felt angry. The teacher's 
classroom authority was being continually 
undermined, her territory continually chal­
lenged. In viewing all this, what were students 
learning about color and sex role relation­
ships? They were learning nonverbally that 
males have more authority than females. The 
higher status admini strator is male, while the 
lower status teachers are female. They see, in 
the school at least, that male roles carry more 
status than female roles (i.e., the janitor can 
interrupt the teacher ). The role and status of 
the female classroom teacher carry a gender 
expectation of subservience, and males have 
hegemony over females. I never saw a male 
enter a classroom and apologize for the inter­
ruption, or ask permission to ,enter. Teachers 
and other personnel, whether male or female, 
always asked permission to see the principal 
and to intrude upon his space. 
I empathized with the expectations accom­
panying the role of teacher. I understood some 
of the subtle structural reasons why most class­
room teachers are female while most building 
admini strators are male. Discovering these 
gender expectations and role relationships, I 
made it a point not to do anything that by 
the broadest stretch of the imagination could 
be interpreted as a challenge to a teacher's 
authority. I assumed their gender expectation 
included my trying to usurp their authority just 
because I was male. I asked permission to enter 
and leave the classrooms. I asked permission 
to move around the classroom or to talk with 
students. I did not unduly argue about the 
many pedagogical discussions we had. My 

SEX, COLOR, AND RITES OF PASSAGE IN ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH 87 
attitude intentionally was respectful rather 
than merely deferential. 
Another strategy I tried was to disassociate 
myself from the other males in the elementary 
building: the principal and the custodians. On 
Bequia, I disassociated myself from females 
initially until I found out the gender expecta­
tions for males on the island. At West Haven, 
I stayed with the teachers from the time I 
entered school until the end of the day. I did 
not want to be identified-by-association with 
the other males in the school, but rather 
wanted to negate the application to me of the 
teacher's assumptions about these males. 
More sexually -orientated gender questions 
emerged. The gender expectation seemed to be 
that males are sexually aggressive toward 
women, irrespective of place or situation. 
Female teachers were concerned with main­
taining a·iprofessional role and I surmised that 
their gender expectation was for males to be 
disrespectful toward them, or at least guilty of 
inappropriate sexual conduct. Males were 
expected not to be appropriate with their sex­
uality, and thus females had to be on guard 
against sexual conduct potentially negating 
their professional status. They began asking 
me if I was married? Did I have children? Why 
wasn't my wife with me? Where in West Haven 
was I staying? Did I occasionaUy go home? 
They wanted to find out, I felt, if I were "safe." 
"Safe" meant whether , as a male, I recognized 
their professional status and would act ap­
propriately. Would the relationship be pro­
fessional, or would I act like a male and be 
inappropriate sexually? Part of their initial 
reserve toward me, I understood, was because 
of gender-related expectations about my 
maleness. 
To get past this long waiting stage I felt I 
must not, on the one hand, be sexually inap­
propriate while, on the other hand, I must act 
so as to acknowledge their professional status. 
This might mean not being sexual in school or, 
especially, in the classroom. I asked myself 
what I would do if I wanted to be sexually 
inappropriate, and then did not do those 
things. I talked about lesson plans and peda­
gogical techniques and the hardships of being 
a classroom teacher , rather than about per­
sonal matters. Verbally and nonverbally, I tried consciously to act so as to communicate that, 
as a male, I would act appropriately and not 
inappropriately display a sexuality potentially 
undermining their professionalism. 
These teachers are prisoners of gender 
expectat ions. The traditional stereotypic 
gender expectations for female teachers, I dis­
covered, have not changed much (cf. Waller 
1932:134-59). Female school teachers are 
expected to be sexually modest if not sexually 
neutral, discreet, paragons of virtue, exhibiting 
propriety and sedateness in manner and dress 
-at least while in school. The unmarried 
female teachers led dual lives. For example, in 
school they dressed moderately, yet after 
school, in larger towns near West Haven, I 
would see them in tight jeans and body shirts 
instead of belted, A-line dresses. Many female 
teachers had male ''friends" living outside 
West Haven and on weekends they traveled to 
visit them. I suspect that any intimation of 
sexual behavior in or around the school is a 
potential prelude to reprimand or dismissal. 
But these gender expectations only applied to 
females. I never detected a female teacher flirt­
ing with a male student, especially in the upper 
grades, but I witnessed male teachers continu­
ally flirting with female students. In the lunch­
room, I saw male teachers flirt with female 
teachers, but not vice-versa. The gender rules 
permitted males to be more sexual than 
females. Understanding the powerful gender 
expectations in the school made my own tem­
porary adherence to their expected sexual 
behavior more palatable. 
Finally, similar to my experience on Bequia, 
I tried to display knowledge and skill hopefully 
decreasing the inevitable waiting period. My 
strategy involved stressing the fact that I am a 
former public school teacher and have taught 
in a variety of settings. Shared knowledge and 
skill emphasizing these commonalities might 
function to negate differences of sex and 
accompanying gender expectations. Indirectly, 
I tried to emphasize that we were teachers first, 
male and female second. I was a teacher, not 
an administrator. I was one of them. I tried to 
communicate that, as a teacher and researcher , 
I was more interested in understanding the 
social and cultural aspects of classroom life 
than in trying to take advantage of them 

88 NORRIS BROCK JOHNSON 
sexually. As on Bequia, I tried to display the 
knowledge and skill we had in common. If 
a teacher casually said that " ... the Gates 
profiles were marginal" (scores on standard­
ized reading tests falling below a statistical 
norm) to another teacher, I casually asked 
about the scores for the last series. If a teacher 
off-handedly mentioned her "rotating periods" 
I assumed she was talking about the duration 
of her particular classes, and mentioned that 
we had twelve-week periods when I was teach­
ing. When a teacher mumbled, talking more to 
herself than to me, that her "contracts " (state­
specified number of days per week the teacher 
must be in the classroom) are for five days, I 
spoke up and asked her about holidays and 
vacation time. As on Bequia, I felt they took 
me more seriously as I displayed knowledge 
and skill associated with their profession. 
Transition 
My relationship with the female teachers 
changed when my perceived identity and their 
ascribed gender expectations began to change. 
Over a period of weeks with some teachers and 
months with others, I was viewed decreasingly 
as a threatening black male "stranger" poten­
tially capable of usurping their authority, and 
increasingly as a former public school teacher 
and colleague interested only in studying 
school classrooms. The event I mark as transi­
tional occurred when several teachers asked 
me to give short talks about anthropology to 
their classes. As on Bequia, the relatively short 
transition period in West Haven comprised a 
specific event or activity. I was offered a gift 
and made a literal transition from being a 
liminal stranger isolated in the back of the 
classroom, to being in the front of the class­
room where I was moment arily acknowledged 
as equal to the teacher. Not all of the female 
teachers presented me with this gift and with 
those few teachers who did not, I must admit 
purposely being kept at the ritual, interactional 
distance prescribed for a stranger. But most 
did ask me. The rite of transition here, as on 
Bequia, involved movement in space. This 
was the first clear offering of a gift extended 
to me by the teachers, and I interpreted the 
offer as a sign of being asked to demonstrate 
a shared identity. I felt complimented by the fact they felt comfortable enough to turn over 
their classrooms to me voluntarily. During that 
short period of time teachers would go to the 
back or the side of the room, in effect handing 
me the gift of authority over the class, an 
authority they guarded stridently from other 
males. 
Entry 
Those teachers who offered the gift of their 
classrooms became more relaxed with me. 
They joked with me, we laughed more, and 
they began confiding in me. I felt it especially 
meaningful when they began talking about the 
principal in my presence. In effect, they were 
saying they had made up their minds that I was 
not a "plant" put in the classrooms by the 
administrati on or by the state. My interview­
ing went more smoothly with those teachers in 
whose classrooms 1 had also given the return 
gift of my knowledge. I felt that by seeing me 
as a teacher they were able to talk to me as a 
colleague about the classroom processes in 
which I was most interested . I found myself 
spending more out-of-the-classroom time, 
mostly in the teachers' lounge, with these 
teachers rather than with the others. 
Yet the structure of male/female relation­
ships and gender expectations in the school, 
rather than in the minds of the teachers, mili­
tated against a feeling of substantial incorpo­
ration on my part. For example, I never felt 
comforta ble spending time alone with female 
teachers in the classrooms. One teacher very 
directly told me that students "might talk." 
I felt their own color and gender attitudes 
toward me had changed somewhat, but that 
they remained mindful of the attitudes and 
expectations of others in the school. I did not 
feel quite as awkward when sitting with a 
group of teachers . Further, about half the 
female teachers were white. As a black male I 
was not surprised when my closest informant 
relationships were with black female teachers. 
As in the wider society, gender expectations, 
especially with respect to several of the unmar­
ried white female teachers, monitored rela­
.tionships by color as well as by sex. 
I never felt incorporated into the subgroup 
and setting I had come to research. I did devise 
strategies to overcome prevalent sex and color 

SEX, COLOR, AND RITES OF PASSAGE IN ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH 89 
ascnpttons to the point where they did not 
inhibit the gathering of information, and that 
was comfort able and acceptable to me. 
Sex and color differences between the ethno­
graphic stranger and the host group render 
research difficult, but not impossible. The West 
Haven case suggests that, especially for black 
males, cross-color and cross-sex ethnographic 
research relationships affect the duration 
and character of the stages in van Gennep's 
sequence. I suspect that cross-sex and cross­
color stranger/host relationships are marked 
by a long liminal phase in genera l, especially 
when the stranger is male. I agree with 
Powdermaker's (1966:114) observation that a 
female stranger (and I would add whether 
black or white) is less perceived as a threat, to 
both host males and females, than is a male 
stranger (whether black or white). 
Conclusions 
_Ethnographic research comprises rite-of­
passage transitional experiences, the sequenc­
ing of which in other contexts has been pur 
forth by Arnold van Gennep, which are neces­
sary to be permitted access to meaningful 
sociocultural information. This paper illus­
trates the manner in which rite-of-passage 
events and activities, in particular the kind and 
degree of transition out of the initial liminal 
waiting stage of ethnographic research, are 
affected by the color and sex of the stranger 
as well as the host group. This is an important 
addendum to van Gennep's typology. Sex and 
color differences between the host group and 
the stranger affect the flow of van Gennep 's 
otherwise orderly scheme. In light of this 
several observations and counter-strategies, as 
deduced from my research experiences, are 
suggested. 
On Bequia as well as in West Haven the 
demonstration and display of appropriate 
knowledge and skill, valued by the host group, 
proved a particularly effective means of negat­
ing the effects of color and sex impediments 
to the collection of ethnographic information. 
The strategy heightens a sense of shared 
identity by emphasizing shared competencies. 
Shared knowledge and skill mitigate the 
possible boundaries of color and sex enough to permit effective information gathering. The 
appropriate display of knowledge and skill 
effectively reduces the length of time spent in 
the liminal stranger phase of ethnographic 
research. 
Classic rite-of-passage socialization transi­
tions are non-negotiable with respect to re­
quired demonstration of knowledge and skill. 
In passing from the status of child to adult, 
youth must succeed in tasks they themselves do 
not completely understand and customarily 
have no part in defining (cf. Eliade 1958). In 
attempting to access another sociocultural 
system, ethnogra phic researchers do become as 
little children. But unlike, say, a Hopi child 
going through a Ka-china initiation in a kiva, 
we know, or at least I am suggesting we can 
know, that there is a discernible structure 
and sequence to the sometimes prolonged and 
often scary ethnogr aphic experiences we 
encount er. Much like classic initiations, ethno­
graphic research involves non-negotiated tests 
for greater permitted access to sociocultural 
informati on. Host groups possess standards to 
which strangers must adhere before being per­
mitted access to deep knowledge. The French 
ethnologist Marcel Griaule spent 23 years 
among the Dogon of Mali before being per­
mitted 23 days of intimate conversation about 
Dogon sacred knowledge with the wise hunter 
Ogotemmeli (Griaule 1965:.xi). A long wait­
ing period to be sure, but a waiting period 
nonetheless . It was Griaule's appropriate 
display of what he already knew about Dogon 
metaphysics that gained him access to deeper 
knowledge. Negotiating the passage into 
knowledge of another sociocultural system is 
not merely waiting until people decide if you 
are who you say you are ( " ... only a cultural 
anthropologi st"). That might only mean they 
will decide to talk to you and not kill you. 
Deep access to another sociocultural system 
depends on people feeling that you share some­
thing with them as a fellow human being. At 
some point the stranger must demonstrate an 
interest in, and love for, the culture and people 
in themselves, rather than as the object of 
ethnographic study. One must give up some of 
the observer/researcher role and do something 
well that is valued by the culture. Our pre­
sumed "self/other" split must be negotiated. I 
think this interest/love/ demonstration test is 

90 NORRIS BROCK JOHNSON 
non-negotiable, and, like any rite of passage, 
to the person experiencing it the outcome is 
uncerta in. Passage out of the waiting stage 
is not guaranteed, but knowing that color 
and sex have their effects, and knowing that 
one will be stopped and linger in a waiting 
stage, forces the creative exploration of ways 
to make this invariable sequence move 
smoothly. 
A second conclusion is that finding a sub­
group cadre of people, or choosing a whole 
society itself, that reflects one's personal 
temperament renders one less a stranger by 
decreasing the liminal waiting stage of 
ethnographic research. Napoleon Chagnon 
(1974:162-97) liked the Yanomamo; it is 
clear, to me at least, that he was drawn to this 
stereotypically masculine culture for more 
than professional reasons. I think Chagnon's 
temperament decreased his liminal waiting 
period and made possible important transition 
invitations (such as blowing ebene) and other 
experiences. John Gwaltney's (1980) work on 
ordinary ("drylongso ") black American life is 
as much informed by his temperamental align­
ment with this "unit of study" as it is with the 
acceptance of the ethnographer by this sub­
group and their invitations for him to share 
deep knowledge. Is this subtle factor at work 
in the conscious/unconscious choices of people 
and problems we choose for ethnographic 
research? 
Thirdly, research in West Haven and on 
Bequia reinforced my personal and profes­
sional commitment to participant as well as 
nonparticipant observation as an ethnographic 
information gathering strategy. Both research 
experiences offered the opportunity to do 
something as well as study something. Com­
mentaries· on such experiences are rarely 
printed in contemporary accounts of ethno­
graphic research, and my feeling is they are not 
as prevalent as they once were. The notion of 
an "objective" observer dispassionately 
removed from the experiential reality of the 
sociocultural situation under study is a preva­
lent ethnographic image (Jules-Rosette 1978; 
Maruyama 1974). More participant forms 
of ethnographic research were once quite 
common. Ruth Bunzel (1929), for example, 
tells us she intentionally chose to research 
(female) Pueblo potters by apprenticing herself to a Pueblo potter. Using herself as the primary 
research instrument, Bunzel felt she could best 
understand the process of making Pueblo 
pottery by learning to make pottery accep­
table to Pueblo potters. Then there is the 
well-known ethnographic example of Frank 
Cushing (Gronewold 1972). Cushing learned 
so much through being invited to participate 
in Zuni culture that he was initiated into one 
of their secret societies. As Cushing decided 
not to publish much of the deep knowledge 
into which he was initiated, this remains an 
extreme case of participant research. Zora 
Neale Hurston (1970) has not been adequately 
recognized for her contributions to folklore. A 
Boasian cultural anthropologist, Hurston was 
also a trained folklorist. Her accounts of the 
personal rigors of gathering folklore are as 
informative as are the folk materials them­
selves. David Lewis (1976, 1978) mixed par­
ticipant and nonparticipant observation in his 
exciting studies of Polynesian navigational 
systems. Lewis enjoyed a considerable reputa­
tion as a sailor and navigator before asking 
Polynesian navigators to teach him their 
indigenous system of pathfinding by sailing his 
29ft ketch. To learn more, Lewis served as an 
apprentice navigator on a 60ft double-hulled 
canoe sailed, by wave patterns and the stars, 
from Hawaii to Tahiti. In all these cases, host 
groups shared deep knowledge in association 
with the ethnographer's emphasis on partici­
pant forms of observational research. 
Ethnographic research is a political act, and 
political considerations influence the nature of 
ethnographic research.12 Traditionally , ethno­
graphic strangers have been white males, and 
to a lesser extent white females, studying 
peoples of color, in part due to support by 
political relationships between ethnographic 
anthropology and coloniaVneocolonial gov­
ernments (cf. Sontag 1966; Malinowski 1967; 
Willis 1969). The politics of travel and access 
make it more likely that David Lewis will go 
to the Carolina Islands to study wave patterns, 
rather than a Polynesian to Martha's Vineyard 
to study Euro-American navigational systems. 
My strategies for de-emphasizing the effects of 
color and sex are offered within the context of 
continuing psychological resistance on the part 
of whites to being "studied" in the same ethno­
graphic fashion as whites have traditionally 

SEX, COLOR, AND RITES OF PASSAGE IN ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH 91 
studied people of color. Black ethnographers 
are a comparatively recent phenomenon (cf. 
Hsu 1973; Hsu et al. 1973; jones 1970; Remy 
1976). Being a black male makes negotiating 
the ethnographic passage politically more dif­
ficult in some situations, and easier in others. 
My ongoing ethnographic relationships were 
more satisfying with blacks than with whites. 
Did I cheat? Would a more culturally-dif ferent 
encounter involve my working more with 
whites? My relationship with resident Bequia 
whites, especially white males, was strained 
because of what I felt was their reluctance to 
put themselves in the position of one "studied" 
-especially by a male person of color (cf. 
Koentjaraningrat 1964: Weller and Luchter­
hand 1968). How would a black female ethno­
grapher have fared? While the display of skill 
and use of participant observation strategies 
brought me close to most of the white males, 
the gifts inviting further contact were not 
forthcoming. Unlike Griaule, I was not pre­
pared to wait 23 years for them to come. I have 
not solved this issue of the politics of color in 
the ethnographic situation, but I do know that 
it probably will not be completely solved by 
displaying competence and using participant 
observati on. 
Finally, an underlying premise of van 
Gennep's typology is that incorporation of the 
stranger into the host group is in fact desirable. 
Unlike adolescent to adult rites of passage, 
rites of passage during ethnographic research 
do not result in a fixed status and role in the 
society under study. Even though Griaule was 
given a Dogon ceremonial ritual to honor his 
death, his ethnographic rites of passage did not 
in fact make him a Dogon. The case of Frank 
Cushing reminds us that complete incorpora­
tion into the culture under study logically 
results in the elimination of the researcher role! Fine for the wayfaring stranger perhaps, but 
not so fine for the ethnographic stranger and 
for those who would find information on the 
Zuni useful to the cross-comparison of cul­
tures. To maintain the researcher role, com­
plete incorporation is not desirable. By its very 
nature then, ethnographic research is a liminal 
experience. This paper suggests strategies for 
making sense of the liminali ty, not strategies 
ensuring incorporation, I am not suggesting 
that it is desirable to "go native," though I feel 
being invited to do so is a high compliment. 
I only note that the most remembered ex­
periences of ethnographic research are those 
where, despite the factors of color, sex, and the 
impossibility of incorporation, one is invited 
to participate in significant transition events 
and activities. 
We are most familiar with van Gennep's sep­
aration/tra nsition/incorporation sequence - a 
sequence which, I feel, is not as applicable 
or as useful to understanding host/researcher 
relationships as is his little-used stopping/ 
waiting/trans ition/incorporation sequence. 
The initial stages of the prototypic ethno­
graphic research experience invariably corre­
sponds to this latter sequence. The separation/ 
transition/incorporation sequence is more 
applicable to ethnographic research as a rite of 
passage into the professional status and role of 
cultural anthropologist. One can achieve the 
former without experiencing the latter. 
For ethnographers, though, the latter 
sequence is itself an important transforma­
tional experience. ln both cases, the concept of 
rites of passage, as modified by the implica­
tions of sex and color, remains a useful guide 
to detecting the form of the personal initia­
tion and transformati on experiences required 
by the ongoing practice of ethnographic 
anthropo logy.
