Healing Dilemmas 
Donald Pollock 
Anthropologists who provide medical care in 
the field are confronted with at least two 
important types of ethical dilemma, a practi­
cal one and a representational one. The prac­
tical dilemma emerges from the fact that most 
of us who choose, or are called upon, to 
provide health care to our indigenous hosts 
possess neither the knowledge nor the facilities 
for the practice of medicine at any level of sig­
nificant competence, yet we are compelled by 
our own faith in western biomedicine to wish 
for its benefits to be available to our hosts. As 
well, like most anthropologists we also face an 
ethical dilemma of representation. On the one 
hand, by representing indigenous healers as 
"shamans" or "witch doctors," we draw 
attention to the culturally situated nature of 
the roles played by such figures in any society, 
roles that are almost never limited to "healing" 
in our western sense. But we represent them in 
this way only at the risk of implying that, as 
shamans or witch doctors, indigenous healers 
practice in ways that are so culturally embed­
ded that they have no relevance in other 
cultural contexts, while our own medical prac­
tices remain as effective in the field as they are 
at home. We assume that penicillin "works" in 
spite of belief in it; waving a dead chicken at 
the aurora borealis is effective, if at all, only 
because of belief in it. Both of these kinds of 
dilemmas are captured in the suggestion by 
Jeffrey Ehrenreich that we consider the anthro-pologist in the field to be the "witch doctor," 
a figure who may appear to possess extraordi­
nary power, but who is, from a slightly differ­
ent perspective, a rather comic manipulator of 
empty symbols. 
The practical dilemmas of amateur doctor­
ing are fairly common for anthropolo gists, 
certainJy for those working in lowland South 
America, but there appear to be few discus­
sions of the ethical issues entailed (McCurdy 
1976). When I arrived in the field for the first 
time, the most serious medical issue I had ever 
dealt with was choosing among over-the­
counter cold medications and antacids, yet in 
the field I was expected to manage a 40-day 
course of therapy for a three-year-old' s leish­
maniasis, to recommend treatment options for 
people I thought might have tuberculosis, to 
treat what I assumed to be gonorrhea, and to 
dispense a variety of powerful antibiotics, nar­
cotics, and other drugs, some of them banned 
in the United States. Although my opportuni­
ties to do any serious damage were limited, I 
believe, by the basically good health of the 
people I worked among and the availability of 
useful handbooks such as Where there is no 
doctor, the ethical dilemmas remain and are 
more complex than the simple goal of doing 
no harm (Pollock 1988). 
In this article I discuss a related ethical 
doctoring dilemma, a dilemma of power. It 
coofronts us when we assume that many

indigenous communities accept our medical 
assistance without any special faith in its effi­
cacy, whether that care is provided by amateur 
physicians or professionals. In this form it 
has been elevated to the status of a central 
colonial offense. Megan Vaughn (1991), for 
example, discusses the ways in which the 
western medicine brought by missionary 
physicians to nineteenth-century African 
peoples was used to legitimate the imposition 
of Victorian morality , standards of dress, sex­
uality, diet, and even thought on indigenous 
cultures. Jean Comaroff (1992), similarly, has 
exposed the role of nineteenth-century medi­
cine in offering a "humane" facade to the bru­
talizing regimes of colonialism in South Africa. 
While the process of objectification that colo­
nized peoples undergo through their experi­
ence with western medicine is one that 
colonizing peoples themselves undergo in 
every medical interaction, the potential of 
medicine to legitimate a moral order of 
humanity in which white northern Europeans 
occupy the highest position has also rendered 
the exercise of medical power in transcultural 
settings ethically problematic. 1 
The dilemma of power also arises for 
anthropologists when our hosts request or 
even demand the benefits of western biomedi­
cine, and when we find ourselves coerced, 
manipulated, or ordered to provide medical 
assistance. This is a dilemma that arose for 
both myself and for my Kulina Indian hosts. It 
arose because the health of his village is the 
responsibility of a Kulina headman. When, as 
among the Kulina, illness is caused by witches 
in enemy villages, when it is a political force 
inscribed within the body and soul, the control 
of access to diagnosis and treatment is a sig­
nificant source of power, especially for the 
village headman. The anthropo logist, posses­
sor of symbols of power -machines, money, 
medications -however powerless in her or his 
own belief, may represent a considerable 
threat to indigenous structures of power, one 
that must be brought under control by coer­
cion, marginalization, or even expulsion. 
This dilemma is, as far as I am aware, almost 
unique to anthropo logists and other long-term 
visitors to traditional, indigenous communi­
ties, and there appear to be no good precedents 
in the literature on medical ethics to guide the fieldwor ker. Perhaps the most similar cases in 
medical ethics concern the paramedics or even 
less well-qualified individuals who are some­
times called upon to render extraordinary 
forms of medical care, even surgery, during 
war, on ships, or elsewhere. But in these cases 
there is usually a shared understanding 
between the care giver and the care receiver of 
the nature and level of treatment possible, and 
of the relative consequences of doing some­
thing versus doing nothing. This situation is 
unlike the anthropological setting, in which 
there is usually a complete lack of shared belief 
about the nature of health and illness, the 
nature and level of medical care available, and 
the possible outcomes of various alternatives. 
Another possibly relevant ethical situation 
in mainstream western medicine is the reluc­
tance or refusal of some physicians to treat 
patients infected with HN, a situation that is 
similar through a kind of reversal or inver­
sion.2 In that case, physicians who possessed 
the technical medical skills and knowledge of 
disease, and who fell under an ethical obliga­
tion to treat patients, nonetheless refused. In 
the case of fieldworkers, anthropologists who 
have few or no technical skills and little knowl­
edge of disease, and who have only the 
weakest ethical obligation, at best, to treat sick 
people (and traditionally strong ethical oblig­
ations not to impose western culture on indige­
nous communities), nonetheless plunge right in 
and play doctor. However, the example of 
physician refusal to treat HIV patients only 
allows us to delimit the ethical dilemma, not 
necessarily to resolve it. 3 While the physician 
confronting AIDS possesses very specialized 
knowledge and skills, these have been ineffec­
tive in curing the disease; the anthropologist, 
on the other hand, often feels that even the 
serious illnesses contracted by members of 
an indi genous community could be treated 
successfu lly by western medicine, if only the 
anthropologist had the knowledge and skill to 
diagnose and treat them properly. I recall all 
too well the frustration I felt when confronted 
by a case of (I believe) pneumonia and my 
assumption that my antibiotics could cure it, 
if only I knew more about the course of the 
disease, which drugs to use, what dosages, and 
so on. Further, while physicians may have 
responded with anxiety or fear to AIDS and 

318 DONALD POLLOCK 
the homosexuality of many of its victims, 
anthropo logists may experience something like 
the opposite reaction to indigenous patients 
and their illnesses. After all, many indigenous 
Amazonians suffer greatly from introduced 
illnesses such as the common cold, which 
scarcely slow down the western anthropolo­
gist. Perhaps we are compelled to provide 
amateur medical care out of a combined sense, 
usually implicit, that most of the illnesses we 
confront in the field are relatively mild or 
self-limiting, and that our treatments are 
essentially benign. Far from responding with 
anxiety toward our indigenous hosts, anthro­
pologists have historica lly been criticized for 
slipping into more of a paternalistic attitude, 
again normally tacit and unexamined. Both 
cases seem to involve a paradox or dilemma of 
power. 
An incident highlighting this dilemma of 
power occurred early in my fieldwork among . 
Kulina. When I first arrived in the village called 
Maronaua to begin my research in 1981, a 
resident missionary couple associated with 
the Catholic Conselho Indigenista Missionario 
(CIMI) had been providing regular, basic 
medical care for members of this community 
of about 120 people. Howevet; a few weeks 
after my arrival, the couple left for an extended 
break and asked me to keep the key to their 
small storeroom of medical supplies. The day 
after their departure I was roused at dawn by 
the headman of the village, who announ ced 
that we were going to "look for sickness." My 
sleepy inclination, and my American cultural 
experience, was that sick people could make 
their own way to the doctor. If I was to play 
the role, let them come to me, I suggested to 
the headman. He became animated, insisting 
that we go from household to household, 
looking for the sick. I became adamant: I was 
pretty sure no one was sick enough to need any 
kind of medical care, and I wasn't about to 
encourage the kind of abusive over-use of 
health care that Americans are so notorious 
for, at least not at dawn. But when the 
headman' s animation began to reach a hyster­
ical level, it occurred to me that my welcome 
in the village would be rather short-lived if I 
failed to accept his invitation, and I climbed 
out of my hammock. As I expected, no one 
that morning reported any problem for which they wanted my treatment, and even on sub­
sequent mornings the problems I was usually 
offered were minor cuts and rashes, the Kulina 
having noticed that western antibiotic powders 
and washes were often effective for treating 
breaks in the skin. It was otherwise difficult to 
convince people that anything I carried in my 
little medical box would be curative in any 
more profound sense. Despite my occasional 
intervention in cases of serious illness -the 
tuberculosis, the leishmaniasis -my medical 
role was generally marginal and heavily 
controlled. 
Part of the reason for this lies in Kulina 
notions of illness. Kulina lack an overarching 
category of "illness," though they often use the 
Portuguese term doenfa in more or less the 
way a Brazilian would. Instead, Kulina recog­
nize three major kinds of conditions that 
produce the physical discomforts of illness 
(Pollock 1994; 1996). The first of these links 
two potentially fatal illnesses that can only be 
cured by shamans: dori, which is caused by 
enemy witches, and epetuka'i, which afflicts 
infants when their parents eat the meat of male 
animals. Because these are illnesses that can be 
cured only by shamans, and even then only by 
considerable effort, and because I was so 
obviously lacking in any shamanic abilities 
whatsoever, Kulina never called upon me to 
treat anyone with dori or epetuka 'i. Indeed, 
when Katore, an elderly man long resident in 
Maronaua, developed a respiratory infection 
that progressed to pneumonia, and my aspirins 
and antibiotics could not reverse his decline, 
the village shamans redefined his illness as 
dori, as a witchcraf t attack, and more or less 
elbowed me aside to begin the curing rituals 
that they hoped would be effective. When 
Katore died a few days ·later, the major village 
headman reassured me that there was nothing 
that my western medications could have done 
to cure Katore's illness. 
The second variety of illness consists of a 
very wide range of relatively mild conditions. 
that include skin sores, cuts, and rashes: these 
share the feature of being on the outside of the 
body, in particular on the skin, in contrast to 
dori and epetuka 'i, which strike deep within 
the· body. These milder conditions are treated 
primarily by plant medications, often by the 
direct application of masticated leaves or a 

HEALING DILEMMAS 319 
kind of sponge bath of a leafy infusion. This 
kind of medical knowledge is possessed by 
everyone. Many of these external conditions 
respond quickly to western antibiotics and 
antiseptics, and Kulina recognize and value 
the use of such medications for these non­
threatening illnesses. 
Finally, Kulina recognize a variety of intro­
duced illness -measles, colds, mumps -and 
believe that only "foreign" medications are 
truly effective in curing them. One day a 
member of my village, for example, brought 
his daughter, a little girl who appeared to have 
contracted mumps, to me. I insisted that there 
was nothing I could do to cure her illness, but 
her father insisted that I must know how to 
cure this condition, just as he knew how to 
cure any of the wide range of "indigenous" ill­
nesses Kulina contract. When I declined to give 
the little girl an injection of penisilina -the 
generic term for all injected medications -he 
and his family packed their belongings in a 
canoe and took off downriver to look for assis­
tance "from a Brazilian." They returned more 
than a month later and told me that a week 
after leaving the village they found someone 
who gave the little girl an injection (of what I 
have no idea), and, as they expected, the next 
day her illness was cured. It took them nearly 
three weeks to paddle their canoe back upriver 
to the village. They never believed me when I 
told them that the illness cured itself in the 
week they were searching for someone to help, 
and I was left wondering if I should have saved 
them this extraordinary effort by simply giving 
their daughter an injection of distilled water 
with the warning that it took a week to work. 
I also realized that I had succumbed to the 
power of the headman but felt free to decline 
the (equally unreasonable) request of a politi­
cally powerless member of the communit y. 
Not surprisingly, the division of illness into 
three varieties inscribes in the Kulina person 
the major dimensions of a political geography. 
Dori and epetuka 'i are thought of as deeply 
internal, not only within the body, but also 
within the body politic. They are illnesses that 
represent general failures of sociability within 
Kulina life, within households (a child's 
epetuka'i is said to be caused by its parents' 
violation of extended postpartum food taboos, 
but it is diagnosed most often when a husband or wife is found to have committed some 
breach of domestic propriet y, such as adul­
tery), within a village, or between Kulina vil­
lages (dori represents an attack from an enemy 
shaman/village, but if the victim dies it is 
assumed that the witch is a member of the 
victim's village). By contrast, illness that 
appears on the margins of the body -the cuts, 
rashes, sores, and stings that are said to be on 
the skin - describe the limits of proper contact 
with the natural world: they are said to result 
from thoughtless or inappropriate contact 
with the wild domains that surround the socia­
ble village. Finally, introduced illnesses -colds, 
flu, measles -are the embodiment of the con­
sequences of contact with non-Kulina. In a cul­
tural world that contrasts the deeply internal 
against the diffusely external, and ordered 
sociability against wild and dangerous 
"nature" (a category within which Kulina 
include non-Indians), these three varieties of 
illness trace a map of political geography onto 
the body. 
One implication of this view of illness is that 
those whose responsibility it is to insure the 
political stability of the village are also those 
who are responsible for the treatment of 
illness, especially those illnesses that strike as 
a consequence of disrupted sociabilit y. Among 
the Kulina all men are nominally shamans, but 
it is the headman of a village who is ultimately 
responsible for both its political stability and 
the health of its members, tasks which, in 
effect, are not separate (Pollock 1992). The 
headman who roused me from my fieldworker 
dreams of pizza and chocolate cake was 
perhaps less interested in the effectiveness of 
my medicine than in maintaining overtly 
public control over a potential source of 
medical treatment. My own naive assumption, 
that medical care had simply an instrumental 
function, not only is false for Kulina, but is 
equally false within our own culture. In that 
regard my dilemma of doctoring in the field 
takes on a different dimension. When medical 
care has a powerfully symbolic component, 
when the very provision of medical care is a 
deeply valued act of sociability assumed of all 
consociates, the question of whether to 
provide such care is not a simple matter of 
gauging how far a situation taxes one's 
medical knowledge. It is, rather� one of those 

320 DONALD POLLOCK 
fieldwork contexts in which we are challenged 
to display our fundamental humanity, and our 
willingness to act toward others as a fellow 
member of a commun ity. 
In this regard the headman of Maronaua 
may have had a more insightful understanding 
of the nature of medical practice than I did at 
the time. We tacitly assume that western med­
icine has primarily instrumental value, that it 
"works" independently of our belief in it. But 
western biomedicine is no different from any 
other ethnomedical system in comprising a 
complex set of symbolic and social practices 
that embed or encode a variety of cultural mes­
sages. Payer's comparison of biomedicine in 
the United States, England, France, and 
Germany (Payer 1988; cf. Lock and Gordon 
1988), for example, reveals numerous ways in 
which cultural values in each setting differen­
tially shape the understanding of illness and 
the practice of medicine among physicians . 
who, in every other regard, appear to share the 
basic "scientific" knowledge of disease and 
therapeutics, and who may even read the same 
medical literature. Ohnuki- Tierney's study of 
biomedicine in Japan is perhaps even more 
revealing of the ways in which cultural con­
ceptions of personhood, status, and power 
shape the ways in which scientific biomedicine 
is practiced (1984). In Ohnuki-Tierney's 
example, hospitalized patients, to take only a 
single instance, lose few of the signs of iden­
tity and status that are regularly stripped from 
the American hospital patient: Japanese 
patients wear their own clothing, use their own 
bedding, eat meals cooked by family members, 
and receive extensive visits from family, 
friends, and co-workers. The American way of 
hospitalization, so often justified within medi­
cine as a set of clinically useful techniques to 
insure patient passivity and receptiveness to 
"doctor's orders," also reproduces basic 
dimensions of American notions of identity, 
personhood, and status, largely by subverting 
them. Western biomedicine, as a form of prac­
tice, is thus shaped by and in turn reproduces 
distinctly western forms of personhood and 
status by locating disease inside of individual 
bodies rather than in the social spaces between 
them or in groups, by surrounding medical 
interactions with intense privacy and secrecy, 
by relying on quantification of signs over sub-jective evaluation of symptoms, by subordi­
nating patients to the authority of experts, and 
by legitimating medical competence through 
credentials rather than through practice. 4 The 
village headman appreciated the performative 
dimensions of medical practice and enrolled 
me to enact them. I naively ignored the prag­
matics, the "ritual" values of medicine as a 
form of signifying practice, and appealed to 
the rather secondary instrumental values it 
might offer in this case. As several commenta­
tors have noted, the sugar pill is not the 
placebo; the giving of the sugar pill is the 
placebo (Brody 1980; Hahn and Kleinman 
1983). 
If the very act of "doing" medicine is poten­
tially beneficial, the form of its doing is still 
culturally specific. As a typically oral Ameri­
can, I first brought to Maronaua medications 
· in oral form: everything from aspirin to antibi­
otics in pills, tablets, and capsules. Kulina 
rejected most of these, preferring injectable 
medications; substances taken by mouth were 
believed to have no therapeutic potential, since 
they merely become transformed into rather 
unpleasant wastes that emerge at the other end 
of the body. Moreov er, injectable medications 
seemed to "work" just like traditional med­
ications, by entering directly through the skin 
to the site of the illness. 5 Ignorance of this 
preference for injections may have been the 
source of the greatest medical damage I caused 
in the village, when I would discover much 
later that people had failed to take the pills I 
gave them. 
I've described a community in which I was 
seen to possess numerous signs of power-tape 
recorder, typewri ter, camera, medications -yet 
I was myself a relatively powerless figure. My 
medical role in the village seemed to me less 
one that I chose than one that was assigned to 
me by the headman. As I reflect on my inter­
actions with this commun ity, it seems to me 
that I was not the one who felt any acute 
ethical dilemma about that medical role, but 
rather that I offered a solution to an ethical 
challenge for the headman, one that, as in my 
earlier anecdote, was negotiated through my 
possible medical role in the village. 
Shortly before my arrival in that first village 
in which I worked, its population had split 
over a series of disputes regarding the presence 

HEALING DILEMM AS 321 
of missionaries in the communi ty, and 
members of one faction � though not all the 
members of that faction � had moved to an 
abandoned rubber-tapping camp about half an 
hour downriv er, which they declared off-limits 
to all non-Indians, especially missionaries. The 
leaders of the two factions were brothers; the 
older brother was universally acknow ledged to 
be the primary headman, but it was he that 
rook the group of his supporters downriv er, 
leaving his politically weaker younger brother 
behind in the main village. The younger 
brother had a self-satisfied kind of arrogance 
in the early days of the split, but this soon 
turned into chronic, anxious suspicion and 
paranoia. That he was a rather weak leader 
was evident whenever his older brother would 
return to the main village for a visit; on such 
occasions people openly praised his older 
brother's dynamic style and impressive orator­
ical skills, and he would be forced to take a 
secondary role for the duration of his brother's 
stay. 
This was an opportune time for an anthro­
pologist interested, as I was, in ethnomedical 
beliefs and practices, since the social violence 
done to the communit y provoked a massive 
epidemic of dori illness, of witchcraft attacks 
that were treated more or less every night by 
the major village shamans. Indeed, the village 
was trapped in a kind of vicious cycle in which 
the suspected presence of illness due to witch­
craft would bring the older brother back, out 
of concern for his close kin, yet the tension that 
surrounded his visits was certainly one of the 
major social sources of the witchcraf t illness 
attacks. In this context it became evident 
that an array of political issues were being 
articulated within an illness discourse. Illness 
became the major public language of political 
relations, within the village, between the two 
factions, between the two competing headmen, 
and between Kulina and Brazilians. Indeed, 
this was centrally a political dilemma, in which 
the expectations of siblingship were being 
pitted against political gains by two ambitious 
headmen. These headmen also contested for 
the treatment of illness in nightly sessions of 
shamanic healing, called tokorime in reference 
to the tokorime spirits into which shamans are 
transformed in the ritual. Not surprisin gly, the 
village was plagued by illnesses that moved continually between two forms, one assumed 
to be caused by witches and the other by 
contact with non-Indians. The ambiguous 
form of the political debate -in which Brazil­
ian missionaries had allies in both village fac­
tions, yet neither felt that missionaries were 
worth fighting over-produced a comparably 
ambiguous illness. 
As I struggled to establish some ethno­
graphically productive role in the village, I 
expected that village members, especially its 
leaders, would simultaneously be trying to fit 
me into some politically productive role. I had 
imagined that this effort would enlist me as a 
go-between with the National Indian Founda­
tion (FUNAI) in the legal battle for land-rights, 
or even with the Brazilians who passed by the 
village from time to time. But it turned out that 
Kulina had little interest in my serving these 
functions. Rather, I was co-opted by one 
headman to help resolve the political dispute 
created over the missionaries: I would provide 
the medical treatment that would cure any ill­
nesses caused by contact with outsiders, and in 
directing me to do so, my headman would 
demonstrate his control over a process of 
illness healing that is one of the most potent 
displays of a headman's power. 
The other dimension of my ethical dilemma 
was less what I did for Kulina than my reluc­
tance to do anything at all. Despite the fact 
that I did treat various illnesses occasionally 
during my fieldwork, I was hesitant to do so 
for several reasons. First, as I described at the 
outset of this article, I was initially unwilling 
to allow myself to be enrolled in the headma n's 
fantasy of how western medical care should be 
provided, though in the end it was expedient 
for me to acquiesce. Second, I was uncertain 
about my ability to recognize diseases ( "diag­
nose" is too formal a term for what I was 
capable of), let alone to offer much medical 
assistance beyond the level of simple analgesics 
or placebos. Third, and perhaps more impor­
tantly, I was reluctant to place myself in a role 
that could have profound implications for my 
position within this village. I want to conclude 
by discussing this last aspect of my ethical 
dilemma of power: the concern that I might 
endanger the health of one or more of my hosts 
in my effort to avoid compromising the role I 
felt I should be playing as an anthropologist. 

322 DONALD POLLOCK 
The poststructura list critique of traditional 
anthropological research condemns fieldwork­
ers for exoticizing their indigenous hosts in 
tacit, even unconscious complicity in the neo­
colonial project that (re)produces the political­
economic divide between the First World and 
the Third or Fourth. The postmodernist dis­
cussion of this problem also notes that anthro­
pologists have had a habit of privileging their 
observational perspective, appealing to false 
stances of objectivity and disengagement and 
their rhetorical underpinni ngs in third-person, 
"'ruJe" saturated ethnographic writing. From 
these perspectives my ethical dilemma of not 
doctoring in the field seems to me in retrospect 
to have been partly the consequence of my 
assumption that I could maintain the tradi­
tional detached researcher's view, marginal yet 
informed, observing all around me without 
becoming involved in, let alone a part of it. 
More generally, my reluctance to become 
involved in medical care was only one aspect 
of a broader problem of negotiating a position 
somewhere between that of the missionaries 
resident in the village and that of the National 
Indian Foundation. In this region of Brazilian 
Amazonia, in the state of Acre, indigenous 
communities were, at that time, not yet 
beginning to undergo the cultural and social 
dislocation associated with deforestation and 
large-scale immigration that has threatened 
communities in neighboring states such as 
Rondonia. FUNAI, which has nominal respon­
sibility for the welfare of indigenous groups, 
was badly understaffed in Acre, and was made 
outright unwelcome by a number of Indian 
communities, including the political faction 
that remained resident at Maronaua. With no 
immediate threat to the security of indigenous 
communities in much of the state, and with 
public opinion in many communities being 
hostile to the government, FUNAI found it 
expedient to tolerate the unauthorized and 
technically illegal presence of CIMI missionar­
ies in many villages such as Maronaua. Provi­
sion of western-style medical care was a major 
priority for CIMI missionaries, a part of their 
overall goal of establishing economically 
secure, politically active, independent, and 
healthy indigenous villages (Pollock 199 3 ), 
one that happened to coincide as well with 
FUNAI' s mission. I reacted to missionary involvement in pro­
viding medical care in rather cynical terms. 
There seemed to be few serious medical prob­
lems that required the extensive pharmacopeia 
and technical medical resources that the 
missionaries maintained; their storeroom of 
medical supplies reminded me of nothing so 
much as Malinowski' s description of the large 
bwayma, the large structure in the middle of 
the village that Trobriand chiefs kept full of 
yams which would ultimately rot in a con­
spicuous display of power and wealth. Bur 
mostly I was reluctant to become identified 
with the missionaries and their project when I 
saw that medical care was a way that mis­
sionaries ingratiated themselves with a 
commun ity. 
The CIMI missiOnanes resident in 
Maronaua complained about the medical 
work of Protestant missionaries of the US­
based Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) 
who had many years earlier established them­
selves in a Kulina village several days' canoe 
trip upriver in Peru, a village called San 
Bernardo. The SIL missionaries, it was said, 
charged Kulina for medical care. I cannot 
confirm this, except to say that Kulina from 
San Bernardo visiting in Maronaua also 
reported this practice, and indeed sometimes 
came to Maronaua (a faster trip down-river) 
seeking medical care for which they could not 
pay at home. The ethics of charging for 
medical care in such a setting are complex and 
beyond the scope of this article, but I should 
note that the practice has to be evaluated 
within the context of a larger SIL strategy of 
establishing small-scale, surplus-producing, 
market capitalist economies in indigenous 
communities which not only become linked to 
surrounding markets, but also seem to offer a 
more receptive set of social conditions for 
Christianizarion, especially Protestantization. 6 
Nonetheless, I am not sure that CIMI gen­
erosity in freely providing medical care was 
not also predicated on the implicit expectation 
that various return prestations -of political 
support, shelter, food -would be made. It 
might be argued that the expectation of diffuse 
returns for medical care can be even more 
insidious than the expectation of immediate 
payment; the latter terminates an interaction 
with no additional obligations, while the 

HEALING DILEMMAS 323 
former, in interactions with politically engaged 
non-Kulina such as CIMI missionaries, creates 
enduring, unspecified obligations that these 
missionaries did not hesitate to define and 
assert when necessary. It was this system that 
I was loath to enter. 
The other role available to me was to 
become identified with the National Indian 
Foundation as a kind of official representative 
who could provide medical care as an aspect 
of FUNAI's mission. Indeed, FUNAI itself had 
authorized my initial research largely, I believe, 
to have a quasi-official observer in the region 
who could be expected to report back on both 
indigenous and missionary issues. This repu­
tation preceded me, and I was greeted by 
Kulina upon my first arrival in Maronaua as 
"Funai" and was approached by one of the 
villag� leaders who demanded to know what I 
would do about government promises to the 
village. I immediately distanced myself from 
FUNAI associations, but then left rather open 
the question of my specific identity. With such 
an ambiguous role in the village, it was easy 
for Kulina to project on to me whatever they 
felt was appropriate or expedient, including 
the demand that I provide medical care during 
the CIMI missionaries' frequent absences. 
This, again, was a role I was reluctant to play. 
In pondering the ethical issues of anthro­
pologists playing amateur doctor in the field, I 
turned to an old friend, Dr. Howard Brody, a 
physician and medical ethicist who has been 
writing about medical ethics for twenty years. 
Howard's first response was to wonder if 
anthropolo gists did not adopt the same kind 
of radical cultural relativism about medicine 
that they did about other aspects of indigenous 
cultures: why, in other words, would an 
anthropologist who declines to pass moral 
judgment on infanticide or polygamy, who is 
hesitant (at least in the popular stereotype) to 
bring matches into a community that rubs 
sticks together to make fire, nonetheless be 
willing to provide medical care even in a pro­
fessional, let alone amateur way? When I sug­
gested that the anthropo logist's own faith in 
the value of western medicine and concern for 
the well-being of indigenous hosts, friends, 
and neighbors seems to overwhelm this rela­
tivistic stance, he mentioned the old joke about 
the professor of decision theory who was offered two attractive jobs but was unable to 
choose between them. A colleague noted that 
this professor had built a career on developing 
sophisticated models of decision-making, so 
why not apply the same techniques to the two 
job offers? The professor replied that while 
one could theoretically apply the same deci­
sion-theory models to his own dilemma, this 
problem was really important. Howard's 
observation, without the humorous context, 
was that we sometimes set aside our academic, 
textbook ethics and our theoretical convictions 
when we are faced with the real problems of 
real people. 
This is certainly the case in lowland South 
America. As Alcida Ramos (1990) has noted, 
Brazilian anthropology is nearly inseparable 
from the politics of indigenous rights in that 
country, and Brazilian anthropo logists are, 
more so than their North American colleagues, 
actively involved in the promotion and defense 
of indigenous communities. Such Brazilian 
anthropologists have a profound sense of what 
is .. really important," that the rights of indige­
nous peoples, their survival, safety, and well­
being, are often incompatible with the rather 
old-fashioned perspective of anthropological 
non-involv ement in local cultures. Indeed, in 
the context of struggles over the future of 
indigenous peoples in Amazonia, one may be 
forgiven for believing that the dangers posed 
by the anthropologist playing amateur doctor 
in the field may be insignificant. After all, 
anthropo logists who are not economists, who 
are not policy experts, who are not political 
scientists (or politicians) nonetheless work on 
behalf of indigenous communities for whom 
political, economic, and policy decisions will 
have profound and long-term consequences. 
This attitude also drives applied and "prac­
ticing" anthropologists, of course, but the 
extension of such interventionist activities in 
the transcultural setting of illness has been 
considerably more problematic. Anthropolo­
gists regularly participate in large-scale public 
health projects in other societies, but the 
ethical dilemmas they present are significantly 
different from those of amateur medical prac­
tice in the field. Indeed, the notion of a "clin­
ical anthropology" that emerged in the early 
1980s located this form of practice in largely 
western clinical settings, in which anthropolo-

324 DONALD POLLOCK 
gists were assumed to be part of more complex 
teams of providers, serving as general experts 
on cross-cu ltural communication or on the 
culture of specific patient groups (Alexander 
1979; Chrisman and Maretzki 1982; Shimkin 
and Golde 1983). The ethical issues presented 
by such transcultural medical encounters have 
been discussed within the framework of 
informed consent (Kaufert and O'Neil 1990; 
cf. Kunstadter 1980), but have focused on 
medical practitioners rather than anthropolo­
gists acting alone. 
As I reflect on my own "medica l" work 
among Kulina, I am struck by the aptness of 
the "witch doctor" label. Kulina certainly 
thought my own doctoring had as much to do 
with healing the social body as with curing any 
individual. I suppose that when we consider 
how our own ethical dilemmas arise in the 
field, we should remember that we are also 
being manjpula ted, enticed, and coerced by 
our hosts, enlisted to resolve their own ethical dilemmas and social conundrums. I left the 
village that first time reasonably confident that 
my amateur doctoring had not done anybody 
any harm. But I also felt that my willingness 
to treat illness at times of social upheaval was 
a useful if small part of the headman' s efforts 
to relieve a commun ity's anxiety about some 
of the particularly harmful consequences of 
contact with non-Indians, and in the process 
helped two competing headmen find at least a 
temporary respite from the harmful conse­
quences of political conflict. In the intervening 
years, it has become increasingly clear that the 
greatest threat to the welfare of the Kulina -
as to all Brazilian Indians -lies less in the 
small-scale, amateur medical work of well­
meaning anthropolo gists than in the tragic 
processes of deforestation, population shifts, 
and "development" that are devastating habi­
tats and commun ities. Here again my aspirins 
seem no more effective than a witch doctor's 
rattle.
