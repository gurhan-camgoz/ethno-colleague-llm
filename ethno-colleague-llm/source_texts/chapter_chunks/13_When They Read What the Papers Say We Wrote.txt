When They Read What the 
Papers Say We Wrote 
Ofra Greenberg 
In October 1989 my book A Development 
Town Visited was published in Israel (in 
Hebrew). The book contains an account of my 
experiences in Kiryat Shmona, a community 
where I lived and conducted research for five 
years. Kiryat Shrnona was founded on Israel's 
northern border in 1950, largely as a result of 
a government policy promoting the geogra­
phical distribution of the population. It was 
settled by new immigrants from North Africa, 
Iraq, and Hungary, and was given the status of 
"development town" on the strength of its 
location and the composition of its popula­
tion. This entitled both the municipa lity 
and its citizens to various government 
dispensations. 
Within a few years, most of the inhabitants 
of European origin (Ashkenazis) had moved to 
the center of the country. By the 1980s, 90 
percent of the popuJation of 15,000 was of ori­
ental origin, characterized by a low educa­
tional level (haU the population had only an 
elementary education), negligible professional 
training, and low average income. During the 
period under study, families there were receiv­
ing welfare support at a rate 50 percent above 
the national average, partly a result of the high 
proportion of families with four or more chil­
dren. Most of the inhabitants defined them­
selves as being religious, or at least as adhering 
to Jewish tradition. At the outset of my research I was interested 
in the utilization of traditional medicine by 
immigrants from oriental countries. While 
attempting to investigate the extent and nature 
of this activity, I also looked into the charac­
teristics and quality of the established medical 
services. Since Kiryat Shmona is situated far 
from the center of the country and has a pre­
dominantly low-income population, modern, 
private medicine was all but nonexistent. Vir­
tually all medical services were provided by 
Kupat Holim, a medical insurance organiza­
tion belonging to the labor federation. 
I discovered early on that a large segment of 
the population was utilizing the services of 
practitioners of traditional medicine. Residing 
in the town were several folk healers who 
employed a variety of techniques which 
included charms and combinations of herbs. 
They treated a diversity of physical, emotional, 
and social complaints. A considerable propor­
tion of their patients simultaneously sought 
help from conventional physicians for ailments 
beyond the scope of the folk healers, such as 
heart problems or cancer. Some were treated 
by both folk and conventional medicine for the 
same complaint (e.g., depression, infertility), 
with the conventional practitioners utterly 
unaware that their patient s were receiving 
treatment from folk healers. Use of folk 
medicine was concealed from establishment

figures such as teachers, nurses, and social 
workers, since patients were apprehensive of 
their hostile and dismissive attitude toward 
such "primitive methods ." 
In due course, I broadened the scope of my 
observation to include the operation of the 
other social services, in particular the wel­
fare and educational agencies. The findings 
revealed a predominantly passive population 
supported by a variety of social services. More­
over, this population demanded greater practi­
cal and financial support from the services 
than that provided for by the formal regula­
tions and criteria (e.g., a demand for a full 
subsidy for children attending a summer camp 
rather than the 75 percent subsidy that had 
been offered). By contrast, in the realm of folk 
medicine -a sphere of activity whose existence 
is not recognized by the authorities -people 
acted ·independent ly, with initiative and even 
mutual assistance. 
After the publication of my book I was inter­
viewed by a young journalist from a small left­
wing newspaper. Her review grossly distorted 
facts and displayed a ··complete misunder­
standing of the book's contents. According to 
this journalist, the people of Kiryat Shmona 
were depicted by me in a venomous manner, 
as being cruel and generally obnoxious. I 
quote from her article: 
Upon reading the book, only a masochist 
would want to visit the place. Kiryat Shmona, 
according to Greenberg's description, is a hor­
rible town. The residents' outlook on life and 
their attitudes are fundamentally flawed, they 
are selfish and evil, public office holders are 
corrupt, the doctors and teachers are the 
worst imaginable .... During the five years 
she spent in Kiryat Shmona, Greenberg found 
innumerable negative traits among the town's 
residents, which she proceeds to enumerate 
one by one. First and foremost is the irritat­
ing tendency to change one's place of work. 
As if possessed, they leap this way and that, 
until at times it seems as though all of Kiryat 
Shmona is in a mad spin. (Hotam, November 
10, 1989, p. 8) 
She continues: "They don't know how to orga­
nize their meals or their lives so as to ensure 
that all the family is satisfied and healthy." In 
support of each such claim a quote is produced from the book, removed from its context and 
often distorted, as in the following phrase: 
"the greengrocer, a cunning and avaricious 
young man." This did not appear in the book, 
and neither did the following supposed quote: 
"The shoppers slice the cheese themselves with 
their filthy hands." 
This journalist referred to a 1949 newspa­
per report about North African immigrants. (I 
have not checked its authenticity.) This report 
claimed that "we have here a people primitive 
in the extreme; their level of education is piti­
fully low, and worst of all, they are unable to 
absorb anything of intellectual value." She 
then added her own observation: "Forty years 
on, Greenberg does the same thing, the only 
difference being that she cloaks her argument 
in rational explanations." Purporting to quote 
from her interview with me, the journalist 
records a question she did not ask, and an 
answer I did not give: "One gathers from 
reading the book that the residents are worse 
than the establishment?" ... "That is what 
happens during the initial period there, they 
behave atrociously towards outside rs." ... "It 
seems that you have difficulty accepting the 
residents of Kiryat Shmona because you feel 
superior to them." 
In her article, the journalist somehow con­
nected the presentation of "the bad people of 
Kiryat Shmona" with the analysis of weaken­
ing family commitment. She is scornful of my 
analysis of the effect of social factors on the 
behavior of the members of the commun ity, 
maintaining that I am suggesting that their 
inhuman behavior stems from their evil char­
acter. In fact, my analysis of the disappearance 
of family commitment does not imply any 
criticism of the local people. In the book I 
present in a neutral way the social conditions 
(in particular the proliferation of welfare ser­
vices) that induce the general passivity of town 
residents toward their lives, expressed here in 
the evasion of family responsibilities and the 
expectation that the authorities wiU intervene. 
This pattern of behavior constitutes a surpris­
ing finding, considering that we are dealing 
with a traditional community characterized by 
binding family ties in its country of origin and 
during the initial period of settlement in Israel. 
The journalist concluded her review by por­
traying me as an arrogant, privileged indivi-

196 OFRA GREENBERG 
dual who observes the "natives" from a supe­
rior viewpoint, "like the traditional European 
anthropologist who investigated the native 
Africans, and who enjoys describing their 
backward and cruel world." She emphasized 
my affiliation with the veteran sector of Israeli 
society, my European origins, my secularity, 
and my academic education, and underscored 
the extent to which these attributes make me 
quite different from the people I studied. It was 
thus easy to characterize me as a European 
colonialist, invading the lives of the natives out 
of sheer curiosity. 
This newspaper article was soon brought to 
the attention of the people of Kiryat Shmona, 
and they reacted angrily. I was attacked in the 
local newspaper and received several telephone 
complaints. In fact, the furor in the town even­
tually caught the attention of the national 
radio. A publication that would otherwise 
have reached only a circumscri bed and mainly 
professional readership became, with the help 
of media exposure, a news item broadcast 
throughout the country. The controversy died 
down only when the editor of the local news­
paper curtailed the publication of further 
letters. However, it had gone on long enough 
in print to ensure that almost everyone in the 
town had heard about the issue. 
In this chapter I describe and analyze the 
reactions of the investigated population to the 
book's contents, paying particular attention to 
the role of the press in mediating the reading 
of my ethnography as well as in defining me, 
a native anthropologist, as a foreigner and an 
outsider. 1 
How the Commu nity 
Responded 
Direct responses 
The stream of reactions was not monolithic. 
People responded differently to the publica­
tion, in general according to their position in 
society. In addition to the townfolk, responses 
came from friends and acquaintances, from 
public figures and politicians, and from pro­
fessionals. Some responses were direct and 
others were indirect. The first direct response came through a phone call from an indignant 
acquaintance from IGryat Shmona. Born in the 
town, she worked for the welfare services with 
senior citizens. "Ofra, what have you done to 
us?" she exclaimed. "How could you sling 
mud at us like that, after we accepted you so 
warmly?" I was surprised and embarrassed. 
Although the journalist had promised to send 
me a copy of the article as soon as it appeared, 
she had failed to do so. I did not know how 
to reply to this caller. Once I had managed to 
obtain a copy of the newspaper from friends 
living on a nearby kibbutz, I was appalled by 
what I read. 
Some days later, the local Kiryat Shmona 
paper, Maida Shmona, printed an article 
written by the leader of the municipal opposi­
tion. This man also had an administrative posi­
tion in the academic institution where I had 
taught, and he knew me personally. In the 
article he wrote: "Ofra, or rather Dr. Ofra 
Greenberg, who honored us by her presence, 
resided in Kiryat Shmona ... and collected 
incriminatory material about the locals ... the 
measure of evil, contempt, hatred, and in par­
ticular racism exhibited by one person towards 
an entire population, is equivalent to a lethal 
dose of cyanide." Later in his article, he admit­
ted not having read the book, claiming, "The 
[newspaper] article is good enough for me." 
From this point onwards, the episode 
rapidly developed into a full-scale public furor. 
People used different mechanisms to direct 
their criticisms at me. Personal acquaintances 
used the telephone. A friend who lived in the 
vicinity of Kiryat Shmona and who had 
worked with me at the local colJege was 
among the first to call. I explained the distor­
tion in the newspaper account and suggested 
that she read the book, which she promised to 
do. She advised me to reply to a letter in the 
local paper, as silence on my part would be 
regarded as an admission of guilt. I took her 
advice and my letter appeared. It elicited no 
djrect response. 
Several other people called to express their 
support. These included a secretary at my 
former college who had spoken to the friend 
mentioned above; a former student who asked 
me to send him the book (unavailable in Kiryat 
Shmona); a volunteer teacher; and a former 

WHEN THEY READ WHAT THE PAPERS SAY WE WROTE 197 
local journalist who had since moved to 
jerusalem. The latter told me that after receiv­
ing a copy of Maida Shmona from his brother, 
he had immedia tely bought the book and read 
it in a day. He was calling to convey his 
support, as he could imagine how hurt I must 
feel. In his opinion, the book portrayed a true, 
if in part painful, picture of the place. He 
found in it considerable affection for the local 
people, and considered the "review" to be bla­
tantly unfair both to the book and to me. He 
also mentioned that he had persuaded his 
brother to read the book, and his brother sub­
sequently wrote a letter of support that was 
published in a different local paper. 
In addition to telephone calls, I also received 
a number of letters, including one from the 
chief rabbi of Kiryat Shmona, with whom I 
was personally acquainted. He wrote with 
symp'athy and support that "it is sufficient to 
photocopy the book's pages, conveying their 
love; there is no simpler or more relevant evi­
dence. To my mind, the �rticle in the newspa­
per ... was an expressio,n of the feeling that 
'an outsider cannot understand us,' and A.'s 
aggressive review was a faithful expression of 
Kiryat Shmona's complexity, which you have 
portrayed with a craftsman's hand.,., 
I received another letter from a member of 
Parliament who had lived in Kiryat Shmona 
for a while and to whom I had sent a copy of 
my book. He wrote: "A wave of memories 
swamped me upon reading the book, and the 
characters you describe so well -with sympa­
thy, understanding, compassion and warmth -
appeared before me again .... I believe that 
this little book, which contains so much 
warmth and beauty, will find a path to the 
hearts of Kiryat Shmona's people." This 
member of Parliament, an active and well­
known public figure in Israel, also wrote to the 
national newspaper. 
My husband telephoned two or three friends 
who worked in the public service in Kiryat 
Shmona (the director of the urban renewal 
project, the coordinator of programs at the 
local community center) to enquire about their 
opinions. They reported that they had found it 
very difficult to accept the article in Maida 
Shmona, and that they wished to read the 
book. Once they bad done so (I sent copies), they called back, expressing support and invit­
ing us to visit them. They added that many 
people in Kiryat Shmona were now hostile 
toward me. The communit y center coordina­
tor told us that there had been a number of 
lively discussions about the book among center 
employees. After people had read it a staff 
meeting was devoted to further debate about 
it. 
Indirect reports 
News of reactions reached me indirectly as 
well as directly. From a neighbor whose 
brother lives in Kiryat Shmona I received a 
report of the uproar that broke out after the 
local publication. The brother added that he 
would advise me to keep well away from 
the town. A friend who works near Kiryat 
Shmona, and who comes into contact with 
town residents, told of their anger and of the 
reaction of one man to a suggesti on that he 
read the book. "I've read the article, and that's 
good enough for me." Another friend who 
teaches in the Department of Social Work at 
Haifa University reported a furious outburst 
from a student from Kiryat Shmona when my 
book was mentioned during a lesson. She had 
not read the book. 
There were also responses in the local press. 
The first letter came from a lawyer, a Kiryat 
Shmona resident of many years' standing who 
was also a personal acquaintance of mine. He 
asked me to send him the book and wrote to 
the paper after he had read it. I quote from his 
published letter at length. 
The reader will find a serious, balanced and 
fair work of research into the structure of 
Kiryat Shmona 's community, and the institu­
tions that are supposed to serve this commu­
nity. The author does not refrain from 
critjcism, but likewise does not fail to record 
the positive aspects of this community. If the 
research is not entirely objective, this is due ro 
the sense of pain born of love, which is evident 
in the book. 
A copy of Ofra 's book is to be found in the 
library of the college at which A. works, but 
he has not bothered to read it, preferring to 
criticize the book, and what is more, also the 
author (whom he knew personally during 

198 OFRA GREENBERG 
her five year stay in Kiryat Shmona), on the 
strength of a tendentious publication in the 
supplement "Hotam." This was A.'s first 
"foul." His second mistake was in failing to 
elicit the author's response. These two trans­
gressions led A. to produce an amazing col­
lection of unfounded and malicious slander, to 
which the term "character assassination " may 
be applied as an understatement. 
No les_s serious than the damage caused by 
A.'s slanderous attack is the general outlook 
from which it derives. Unfortunately, this 
outlook is not peculiar to him ... and is 
shared by most of those who represent and 
form public opinion in Kiryat Shmona. 
According to this outlook, mere residence in 
the town endows its inhabitants with rights 
devoid of obligations; the residents, and in 
particular their leaders, are above all criticism. 
Should the mirror reflect an ugly image, or the 
thermometer indicate the existence of a 
disease, they must be broken! (November 20, 
1989, p. 20) 
The local paper published three other 
responses, two of which expressed support 
from people who had read the book, while the 
other, from someone who read only the article, 
was angrily antagonistic. I received a long 
letter in favor of my book and castigating A.'s 
behavior, which the editor of Maida Shmona 
chose not to publish on the grounds of lack of 
space. 
How the National 
Newspaper Responded 
The discussion in the national newspaper 
Hotam was of a more academic and profes­
sional nature than that in the local paper 
Maida Shmona. In one camp were the author, 
a member of Parliament, a university anthro­
pology lecturer, and the publisher's editor, all 
of whom criticized the journalis t's abuse of 
press freedom in the form of distortion of the 
facts. The respondents were the journalist and 
the editor of Hotam. 
Whereas the correspondence in the local 
paper revealed emotions such as anger and 
hurt, and dwelt upon personal and emotive 
issues, such as the author's character and qualifications and the accuracy of descriptions 
of the town, the discussion in Hotam focused 
on general questions, such as the role of the 
press, or the anthropologist, as a detached and 
balanced observer. For example, the university 
anthropology lecturer wrote: 
The contents, style, and spirit [of the article] 
constitute, in my opinion, a crass and dis­
graceful exploitation of the sacrosanct ideal of 
press freedom, in the name of which such an 
article can be published .... This is not merely 
a matter of quoting out of context, or of sar­
castic comments with no basis whatsoever in 
the book, but mainly of the selective and ten­
dentious manner in which the journalist has 
chosen to convey her own messages .... 
Finally, as a social anthropologist, I protest at 
the irrevers ible damage caused by the jour­
nalist to the reputation of the discipline .... 
The residents of Kiryat Shmona and of other 
development towns may, with justification, 
regard your article as an incitement to a 
renewal of inter-ethnic conflict. Had Ms. X 
done justice to the book, she may have dis­
cerned its constructive aspects, and by so 
doing may have encouraged political and 
social action designed to further the welfare 
and interests of the residents, who are 
deprived by the establishment and paid 
venomous and hypocritical lip-service by the 
media, of the sort exemplified by the article. 
(Hotam, December 1, 1989) 
The journalist replied by alleging that the 
chapter containing descriptions of interesting 
and sympathetic characters had been added 
under pressure from the publisher (a complete 
fabricat ion), and that the complaint about 
quoting out of context was a routine and 
devious defense. 
Finally, the publisher's editor responded by 
claiming that what infuriated him about the 
article was "not only its distortion of the 
book's contents, but also the malice evident 
between the lines .... The journalist from 
Hotam has missed the point of the book. She 
makes only brief mention of the governing 
institutions' responsibility for Kiryat Shmona's 
condition. Ironically, the establishment and its 
failings are let off extremely lightly by the 
crusading journalist" (Hotam, December 1, 
1989). 

WHEN THEY READ WHAT THE PAPERS SAY WE WROTE 199 
Making Sense of the 
Responses 
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the reac­
tion of members of the community where the 
research was conducted is that it was by no 
means monolithic. People both accepted and 
rejected the contents of the publication as well 
as the choice of action taken (or not taken} by 
government agencies as a result of the conclu­
sions drawn. Their position was influenced by 
a number of factors including their public role, 
their level of education, issues of self-image, 
and their personal acquaintance with the 
researcher. 
Certain local politicians used the event to 
further their own interests, that is, to achieve 
popularity by identifying with the "humi­
liated" public and by berating the "stranger." 
For example, the mayor of the town, who had 
his eye on a career in Parliament, added 
his comment to the original article when 
approached by the joum�list. His reaction was 
given without reading the book and without 
checking her version with me. Quoting a 
Hebrew idiom, he spoke of the good people of 
the town being maligned by career-minded 
outsiders who "spat in the well from which 
they had drunk. "2 
The leader of the municipal opposition, an 
ambitious contender for the mayorship, also 
made no attempt to clarify the facts with me. 
His theme was ethnic prejudice and the lack of 
integrity on the part of educated Ashkenazis 
like myself. This theme, a recurring one in 
Israeli party politics, has been successfuJly 
invoked by the major right-wing party to win 
the votes of oriental Jews. Vidich and Bensman 
(1958b:4) observe that in Western society no 
reaction is to be expected when the ethnogra­
phy deals with marginal or minority groups. 
In Israel, however, the poor and uneducated 
oriental population is somehow protected 
from public criticism, which can easily be con­
strued by interested politicians as ethnic or 
even racial prejudice. 
A few people read the book in order to form 
their own opinion, but the great majority of 
the public relied solely on information gath­
ered from newspapers and formed their opin­
ions on that basis. It appears that the higher a person's level of education, the greater was his 
ability and inclination to examine the facts 
independently (in this case by reading the 
book). The more educated individuals in the 
community were less likely to accept the news­
paper account as the truth and more likely to 
take action beyond the confines of their imme­
diate surroundings - by writing to the local or 
national press, for example. 
There is a powerful relationship between 
self-esteem and a tendency to defend oneself 
and protest against criticism. ln Is·rael, the cor­
relation between oriental ethnic origin, low 
educational level, and low income has given 
rise to a paternalistic attitude on the pan of 
the establishment toward the oriental commu­
nities. One of the by-products of this attitude 
has been low self-esteem among many of the 
uneducated oriental Jews who have no confi­
dence in their ability to exen influence and to 
bring about change, and who therefore took 
no action with regard to my book even when 
they could have responded. This pattern of 
inactivity was evident in many aspects of life, 
some of which are discussed in A Development 
Town Visited. The general lack of active 
response upon reading the article in the local 
paper is symptomatic of this syndrome. 3 
On the other hand, when those suffering 
from low self-esteem imagine that their weak­
ness is being pointed out, they are apt to react 
strongly. In the development town under dis­
cussion, many of the public officeholders had 
little formal education. The leader of the 
municipal opposition, who held a senior 
administrative position in the college although 
lacking a complete academic education, was 
quick to ridicule my doctor's title as well as my 
discipline as part of his defense of himself and 
his commun ity. 
While responses differed depending on 
factors such as public role and level of educa­
tion, there were nevertheless a few issues 
around which objections were fairly uniform. 
One of these was my discussion of family ties 
and obligations. Not every issue will arouse 
the same intensity of objection, and they will 
vary from one culture to the next. In Israel, the 
family is clearly a sensitive topic. 4 
The role of the family in the nationaJ myth 
has, over the years, undergone several changes 
that have been bound up with the complex 

200 OFRA GREENBERG 
pattern of relationships between Ashkenazi 
and oriental Israelis. In the initial period of 
statehood, emphasis was placed by official 
ideology on the individual's commitment to 
society, whereas the importance of family 
attachment was considerably muted. 
Later years brought with them a change in 
official attitudes toward the culture of oriental 
Jews in general, and toward the place of the 
family in that culture in particular . This change 
was due to complex sociopolitical processes. 
An accumulation of sociological knowledge 
stressed the importance of social continuity for 
the successful absorption and social adapta­
tion of immigrants, and explained the central 
role played by the stability of the community 
and the family m the process of social integra­
tion. In a parallel development, political 
changes brought the "attitude toward oriental 
Jews" to the forefront of party political strug­
gles, with the main right-wing party succes�­
fully turning it into a major election issue. The 
primary argument was that the time had come 
to respect once again the neglected honor of 
oriental Jews by, among other means, foster­
ing their special culture, and by respecting 
their traditions. 
As a result, there has been a revival in the 
value attached to the family. Whereas dur­
ing the early years an effort was made to 
"modernize" the oriental Jews, recent years 
have seen a glorification of the '�good quali­
ties" of oriental ethnic groups (as a result of 
both social consciousness and political mani­
pulation). Among the components that form 
this romantic-nostalgic idealization is the ex­
tended, warm, supportive family. This image 
plays its part in the newly acquired ethnic 
pride among some of the orienta ls. To ques­
tion its validity in public discussion is unac­
ceptable, although in private many orientals 
admit that reality falls far short of the ideal 
type. Nevertheless, a description perceived to 
be critical of an important component of the 
recently established community pride (in this 
case also ethnic pride) causes an emotion-laden 
response. 
As Brettell points out in the introduction to 
this volume, sensitivity on the part of an inves­
tigated community to its public image has been 
noted by other anthropologists following reac­
tions to the publication of their research. Scheper-Hughes, for example, reports that 
people do not object to the distortion of 
reality, but rather to seeing it in print. They are 
willing to accept her writing about them -even 
if it is critical -as long as it is not widely pub­
lished, even though this is intended to benefit 
them. 5 Conversely, criticism of public institu­
tions such as schools or a health clinic is 
readily accepted because responsibility is easily 
assigned to outsiders, in particular to govern­
ment offices and officials. It is, in short, the 
violation of self-image, that brings about the 
stormiest reactions . 
Conclusion: The Press as 
Mediator 
Newspapers played a leading role in shaping 
the response to the publication of A Develop­
ment Town Visited. Most of Kiryat Shmona's 
residents would not have heard about the 
book's publication had it not been for the 
appearance of the article. Without the jour­
nalist's subjective and tendentious interpreta­
tion there would have been no public outcry. 6 
Anthropological literature provides us with 
several examples of the manner in which the 
press magnifies the resonance of a research 
report, selectively publishing certain sections 
in an endeavor to provoke the interest of 
readers. Renata Rosaldo (1989:63) describes 
the reactions to his research among the llongot 
in the Philippines, while Gmelch (1992} had a 
similar experience in Ireland. The account 
extensively reported in the introduction to the 
present volume of the Italian media represen­
tation of Schneider's work strikes a familiar 
note, as does Wrobel's {1979) account of his 
treatment by the Detroit press.7 
The conflict between the anthropologist and 
the journalist arises out of a discrepancy of 
interests and a different professional ethic. 
First, the journalist is guided by a goal of 
drawing maximum attention to his product. In 
some cases this is achieved by distorting the 
facts in order to create a more sensational 
effect. Second, his professional ethic allows 
�im to make value judgments on the material 
he presents. Some journalistic ideologies (e.g., 
"new journalism" [DeFleur and Dennis 1981] 
go so far as to encourage the journalist to 

WHEN THEY READ WHAT THE PAPERS SAY WE WROTE 201 
express his own subjective opinions. Many 
journalists thus find it difficult to understand 
the complex approach of the anthropolo­
gist, who can respect the people he or she 
researches while at the same time describing 
and analyzing their behavior from a neutral 
perspective. The anthropologist does not make 
judgments, whereas the journalist in many 
cases does. The work of the anthropologist is 
thus evaluated according to journalistic crite­
ria. This results in misunderstanding. 
The press is often perceived by the public as 
a representative of society and its product as a 
reliable reflection of reality. The question of 
whether a certain event really did take place 
(in our case, whether the book actually con­
tains derogatory material) becomes largely 
irrelevant. Most people will not bother to read 
the original book or article, as they "know 
what· is written there already." The informa­
tion that sticks is that put out by the media. 
The media's version of the "truth" becomes 
the issue under discussion as the publication 
galvanizes an aggregation of individuals into a 
community under attack, seeking to defend its 
honor. The debate takes on a life of its own 
beyond the control of the ethnographer, and 
around issues (in this case the role of the family 
in Israel and the status of various ethnic 
groups) that may not even have been central 
in the original text. 
What happened after the publication of A 
Development Town Visited is yet another instance of how the press shapes reality. As 
early as the 1920s Lippmann ( 1922) was 
aware of the communication media's ability to 
create their own version of reality. Conse­
quently, people do not react to objective 
reality, but to an environment perceived 
through the media. More recently, theoreti­
cians (including neo-Marxists) have discussed 
the "constructing of reality." According to 
them, the mass communication media neces­
sarily present a nonobjective picture of reality 
and thus affect the moral and ideological 
perception of what is "really going on." For 
example, if a certain unusual phenomenon is 
presented from the conservative viewpoint of 
social consensus, the coverage will tend, indi­
rectly, to denigrate the deviant phenomenon, 
thereby affirming the existing consensus 
(Cohen 1972). This "spiral of silence" theory 
(Noelle-Neumann 1974) maintains that the 
communication media not only form the image 
of reality, but actually intervene to play a part 
in forming reality itself by urging people to 
action or to passivity on the strength of dis­
torted information. They rhus bring about a 
result that would otherwise not have occurred 
(for example, people who do not bother to 
vote because they have been led by the press 
to believe that theirs is a lost cause). The press, 
in short, is a powerful factor influencing what 
happens when the people we write about read 
what we write.
