A Woman Going Native 
Hortense Powderm aker 
X A Woman Alone in 
the Field 
In casual daily life I was much more with the 
women than with the men; the sexes were 
quite separate in their social and economic life. 
I often sat with the women of my hamlet and 
of neighboring ones, watching them scrape the 
taro, the staple of their diet, and prepare it for 
baking between hot stones. Notes on the dif­
ferent ways of preparing taro became so volu­
minous that I sometimes thought of writing a 
Melanesian cook book. I was apparently com­
pulsive about writing everything down, but I 
justified the fullness of the cooking notes by 
saying that they illustrated Melanesian inge­
nuity and diversity with limited resources. 
More important than the cooking notes were 
my observations on the relationships of the 
women with their daughters and with each 
other; listening to the good-humored gossip 
provided many clues for further questions and 
added subtlety to my understanding. 
Pulong, whom I saw daily, was in the middle 
stage of her pregnancy, and I could observe her 
customs such as not eating a certain fish 
believed to "fight" an embryo in the stomach. 
Full details about pregnancy customs and 
taboos came later and gradually. When I first 
asked Pulong if there was any way of prevent­
ing pregnancy, she said she did not understand and looked vague. It seemed evident that she 
did not want to talk about the subject. Some­
what later, she and my adopted "mother" and 
a clan "sister" brought me leaves that they said 
would produce an ahortion if chewed in the 
early stages of pregnancy. I put them carefully 
in a botanical press for identification when I 
returned home. 
It was taken for granted that I should go to 
all the women's feasts in or near Lesu. The 
morning of a feast was usually spent in prepar­
ing the food; then came the dances, distribu­
tion of food, and speeches. At one such feast 
in a nearby village to celebrate the birth of 
a baby, the hundred or so women were in a 
particularly gay mood, which I enjoyed. One 
woman, a born jester, who was not dancing 
because her relationship to the newborn 
baby precluded it, grabbed the drum and 
began doing amusing antics. It was like an 
impromptu skit and all the onlookers laughed 
loudly. Encouraged, she continued. Then came 
the distribution of bundles of baked taro, most 
of it to be carried home, and the women's 
speeches praising the ability of their respective 
husbands as providers of food. However, one 
complained that her husband was lazy and did 
not bring her fish often enough. In the late 
afternoon, my Lesu friends and I trudged 
home. A basket of food and sometimes a baby 
was on each woman's back (except mine), and

although we were all tired after a long day, a 
pleasant, relaxed feeling pervaded the small 
group. 
As I ate my dinner that night and thought 
about the day's events, I felt happy to be 
working in a functioning traditional culture 
rather than one in which the anthropologist 
has to get most of his data about tribal life 
from the reminiscences of the elders. Some­
times I asked for details of a ritual in advance 
of its performance; when it took place, some 
differences usually showed up, even though 
the customary pattern was followed. After one 
rather important ceremony, I made this point 
to an informant who had given me particularly 
full details in advance. He looked at me as if I 
was either stupid or naive (or both}, and asked 
if I didn't know that nothing ever took place 
exactly as it was supposed to. Nor can gener­
alizations by Melanesians, or anyone else, 
include all the specific details of actual 
happenings. 
Although it would not have been considered 
appropriate for me to be with the men in their 
casual social life as I was with the women, it 
was understood that I must observe and learn 
about men's economic and ritual life, which 
was apan from the women's. I worked on my 
veranda with individual men as informants 
and as teachers of the native language. I did 
not go to men's feasts and other rites unless I 
was invited, but I was invited to everyth ing. 
When the men were having a feast, usually in 
the cemetery, two elders called for me and 
escorted me there. I sat on one side, apart from 
the men, and munched a banana as I recorded 
what was said or done. Later I went over the 
notes with one or two of the men who had 
been present. One morning, although I arose 
very early -before dawn -to go to a men's 
feast in a neighboring village, I was still eating 
my breakfast when the Lesu men were ready 
to leave. Without saying anything to me, they 
detailed one man to wait. The sun was just 
rising when he and I staned our walk to 
Ambwa, about three miles away. 
I had to go to all feasts for the same reason 
that my presence was required at every mor­
tuary rite. But no law of diminishing returns 
operated for the feasts, since the events they 
celebrated were so varied: bi� bestowal of 
name on a newborn baby, appearance of his first tooth, early betrothal, first menstruation, 
initiation of boys, marriage, completion of any 
work, death, and practically every other event 
-small or big -in life. Through these feasts I 
gained not only a knowledge of the normal 
round of life, but I saw also the economic 
system functioning. It was evident from the 
speeches and from my informants that the 
exchange of bundles of baked food was by no 
means casual, but followed a rather rigid 
system of reciprocal gifts. I heard praise for 
those who were generous and gossip about 
those who were slow to make gifts in return 
for those taken. As I typed my notes and 
mulled over them, I thought that perhaps I 
would organize all my data around feasts. An 
article on them, rather than a book, did even­
tuaHy emerge after I left the field. There, I 
found it difficult to think in terms of articles, 
because I was always trying to relate one 
aspect of the culture to everything else. 
I was more selective in going to other activ­
ities. I could not afford the time to go regu­
larly with the women to their gardens. They 
left in the early morning and did not return 
until midaftemoon. But I did go often enough 
to observe the various stages of their work. 
Fortunately, there was no feeling that my pres­
ence was necessary at all gardening activities. 
It was the same situation with the men's 
fishing. I waded into the shallow wat_er by the 
beach and watched the different .· forms of 
fishing: with spears, nets, traps, and hooks. 
But I was content with seeing each kind of 
_ operation once or twice and discussing details 
of it afterwards with informants. Later, I wrote 
down the magical spells connected with gar­
dening and with fishing. 
I was lucky that during my stay the initia­
tion rites for eight boys from Lesu and from 
two neighboring villages took place. (They did 
not occur every year, but only when the 
number of boys reaching puberty was suffi­
cient to justify the elaborate rites.) Less than a 
month after I settled in Lesu, the women began 
practicing a dance each evening. An elderly 
man was teaching them, but it was taboo for 
other men to see the rehearsals, although they 
would see the dance at the ritual. 
I sat watching the women practice. The 
moon was new and delicate, the sea dark and 
noisy, and the singing women moved in a circle 

-A WOMAN GOING NATIVE 67 
around a fire with slow dancing steps. They 
asked me to join them, but I was too self­
conscious. I sat watching and held one of the 
babies. But each night, as the music and formal 
steps became more and more monotonous, 
lasting until midnight, I became increasingly 
bored. I had to force myself to stay awake. 
Finally, one evening, I gathered my courage 
and began dancing. My place in the circle was 
between Pulong and an important old woman 
in her clan. The old women danced with more 
vivacity than the young ones; the gayest 
woman of the village was a grandmoth er. 
Good-natured laughter greeted my mistakes, 
which were carefully corrected. The steps were 
not difficult and I soon caught on to them. No 
longer were the evenings monotonous. Every 
night, as the moon became fuller, I danced. 
But, somehow, I did not think ahead to the 
night of 'the big rites. 
Finally it came. That morning, Pulong and 
several other women came over and presented 
me with a shell arm band and a kepkep, a 
,tortoise-shell breast ornament, and asked that 
I wear their favorite dress - a pink and white 
striped cotton. I gulped, and said I was not 
going to dance; I would just observe. But why, 
they asked in astonishment, had I been prac­
ticing every night? I could not explain that I 
had started because I was bored and that now 
I felt too self-conscious to participate in rites 
which I knew would be attended by thousands 
of natives from all over the island and nearby 
islands. Soon I saw that I had to dance. A 
refusal now would be a rejection. 
All day there was an increasing "before the 
ball" excitement. Hair was colored with bright 
dyes and bodies of men were ornamented. The 
tinsel trimming which I had brought with me 
was in demand by the women dancers, who 
wound it around their hair. At sunset my 
dancing companions assembled at my house 
and we walked together up to the far end of 
the village. Like the other women, I had a 
yellow flower behind my ear; the kepkep 
strung on a piece of vine hung from my neck; 
shell bracelets were on my left arm just above 
the elbow. I wore the pink and white striped 
dress. I was excited and nervous. 
When we arrived, about two thousand 
Melanesians from all over New Ireland and 
neighboring islands were sitting around the fires. We took our places and watched the 
dances, which went on continuously all night 
long in an open clearing before an intently 
absorbed audience. Most of the men's dances 
were dramatic, ohen acting out a story such as 
the killing of a crocodile. Masks were elabo­
rate; dancing was strenuous and the drums 
beat vigorously. The women wore no masks 
and their dance.s, which alternated with the 
men's, were far less elaborate and formed 
abstract patterns of lines, squares, and circles. 
Young men held burning torches near the 
dancers, so that all could see them. 
I was unable to pay much attention. Con­
sumed with self-conscio usness, I imagined my 
family and friends sitting in the background 
and muttering in disapproving tone, "Hort­
ense, dancing with the savages!" How could 
I get up before all these people of the Stone 
Age and dance with them? I prayed for an 
earthquake - the island was volcanic. But the 
earth was still, and all too soon it was our turn 
to dance. I wondered if I would not collapse 
on my way to the open clearing which served 
as the stage. But there I was in my proper place 
in the circle; the drums began; I danced. Some­
thing happened. I forgot myself and was one 
with the dancers. Under the full moon and for 
the brief time of the dance, I ceased to be an 
anthropologist from a modern society. I 
danced. When it was over I realized that, for 
this short period, I had been emotionally part 
of the rite. Then out came my notebook. 
In the early morning the boys were circum­
cised inside the enclosure. I was invited to 
watch the operation, but decided not to. Nor 
had I gone into the enclosure during the pre­
ceding few weeks when the boys were confined 
there. The normal social separation between 
the men and women was intensified during the 
initiation of the boys. The mothers (real and 
classificatory) openly expressed their sorrow at 
losing their sons who would now join the adult 
men. The women wept (not ritual wailing) 
when the boys went into the enclosure for the 
operation, and began a dance which expressed 
their feelings. Men ran out from the enclosure 
and engaged in a spirited fight with the 
women. They threw stones and coconut shells 
at each other and exchanged jeering talk. Since 
I had been identified with the women, even to 
the extent of dancing with them, it seemed 

68 HORTENSE POWDERMAKER 
unwise in the hostile atmosphere between the 
sexes to swerve suddenly from the women's 
group to the men's. Or, perhaps, I was unable 
to switch my identifications so quickly. 
Later in the morning the piles of food (con­
tributed by the clans of boys who had been 
circumcised ) were given to the dancers. A 
particularly large pile was put in front of me 
and a speech was made praising my dancing 
and expressing appreciation. From then on the 
quality of my relationships with the women 
was different. I had their confidence as I had 
not had it before. They came of their own 
accord to visit me and talked intimately about 
their lives. I secured eight quite long detailed 
life histories. My relationships with the men 
were also subtly strength ened. The formal 
escort to their feasts continued as before, but 
there was a greater sense of ease between us 
and they gave me freely any data I asked for. 
I was glad for many reasons that I had not 
given in to my self-consciousness. Thinking 
about it, I was amused to realize that all the 
things white people had tried to make me fear 
- snakes, sharks, crocodiles, rape - had not 
caused me anxiety. Nor had the expediti on 
taken any particular courage. As one of my 
friends remarked, I had the courage of a fool 
who did not know what she was getting into. 
But to dance with the women at the initiation 
rites -that had taken courage. 
A woman alone in the field has certain 
advantages. Social separation between the 
sexes is strict in all tribal societies. Male 
anthropologists say it is difficult for them to 
be alone with native women, because the men 
(and the women, too) suspect their intentions. 
When traders and other white men have had 
contact with native peoples, they frequently 
have had sexual relations with the women, 
with or without their consent. No precedent 
existed, at least in Melanesia when I was there, 
for a white woman to live alone in a native 
village. We could establish our own patterns, 
and obviously these large strong Melanesians 
could not be afraid of me. (The gun which 
Radclif fe-Brown had insisted I take with me 
for protection remained hidden in the bottom 
of a trunk.) My relations with the women were 
more chummy than with the men, and data 
from the former were more intimate. But the 
men completely understood that I had to find out as much as possible about aU sides of life 
and, very definitely, did not want the mascu­
line side omitted. It was the men, not I, who 
suggested esconing me to all their feasts. My 
impression is that fieldwork may be a bit easier 
for a woman anthropologist alone than for a 
man alone. 
Being alone for a male or female anthropol­
ogist gives a greater intensity to the whole field 
experience than living with company, and fre­
quently provides more intimate data because 
the fieldworker is thrown upon the natives for 
companionship. On the other hand, it has 
the disadvantage of loneliness, and, perhaps, 
getting "fed-up" more often. A mate and chil­
dren reduce the loneliness, and they may be of 
help in securing data from their own sex and 
age groups. Children are often an entering 
wedge into the study of family life. A team of 
colleagues, parricuJarly from different disci­
plines, makes possible a many-sided approach 
to complex problems and offers the stimula­
tion of exchange of ideas while in the field. A 
disadvantage of the family and team is that 
they may make relationships with natives 
more difficult. One member may be quickJy 
accepted and the other disliked. It is usually 
easier for people to relate to one stranger than 
to several. The initial pattern in participant 
observation was the lone anthropologist. 
Today the family and team are becoming more 
common. 
XI "Going Native?" 
Although I had enjoyed those brief moments 
of feeling at one with the women dancers at 
the initiation rites and although I was fairly 
involved in this Stone-Age society, I never 
fooled myself that I had "gone native." I 
participated rather freely, but remained an 
anthropologist. 
While I did fit, to a considerable degree, 
within the Melanesian social system, small 
incidents sometimes brought out a sense of my 
difference. When I admired the beauty of the 
night, my friends looked at me as if I were 
quite strange. They appeared to take the 
scenery for granted, and I never heard them 
comment on its beauty. When I was trying to 
find out about the inheritance of personal 

A WOMAN GOING NATIVE 69 
property, I naturally asked everyone the same 
question: who would inherit upon death their 
tsera (native shell currency), their kepkep 
(tortoise-shell breast ornament), and other 
small personal possessions. My informants 
apparently compared notes, for after a while 
one man wanted to know why I asked every­
one the same question. Did I not know, he 
asked, that there was only one custom of 
inheritance? His question came at the end of a 
long day's work and I was too tired to explain 
the concept of a sample. I contented myself 
(and presumably him) with saying that asking 
the same question of many persons was one of 
the strange customs of my people, thinking to 
myself of social scientists. On the other hand, 
it was I who thought it a strange custom when 
an old man told me while I was doing his 
genealogy that he had strangled his father and 
mother when both of them were old, ill, and 
wanting to die. I looked at the man's kindly 
face and wondered how he could have done it. 
I realized in a few minutes that his attitude 
might be called realistic and mine sentimental, 
and I did not like the latter label. 
Sometimes a crisis brought out a latent con­
flict between the roles of being in and being 
out of the society. My good friend Pulong was 
ill and no one knew whether she would live or 
die. In the early morning, before daybreak, she 
gave birth prematurely to her baby, born dead, 
and her own life appeared to be in danger. All 
day women of her clan were in her mother's 
house (where she had gone when the birth 
pains had started), giving her native medicine, 
performing magic to cure, and tending her. 
Ongus, her husband, sat on a log outside the 
house. (Because the illness was connected with 
childbirth, he could not go into the house.) He 
sat, with his back to the house, his shoulders 
bowed-a lonely, tragic figure. His large, beau­
tifully proportioned body and its attitude of 
tragedy made me think of a Rodin statue and 
of one of Michael angelo's figures on the ceiling 
of the Sistine Chapel. 
Psychological ly, I was not at ease. I walked 
in and out of the house where Pulong lay, but 
I could do nothing. Obviously I knew too little 
of medicine to administer anything from my 
kit. Pulong was my best friend among the 
women and a very good informant; personal 
sorrow was mingled with fear of scientific loss. My sense of helplessness was difficult to take. 
Inanely I remarked to Ongus that I hoped 
Pulong would be better soon; he replied 
gravely that he did not know. Even before he 
answered, I knew my remark was silly. I sat 
around the bed with the women, went back to 
my house, wrote up everything, wandered 
back to Pulong's bed again. The fact that I was 
getting good data did not take away my rest­
lessness. I felt all wrong during this crisis: 
outside it, though emotionally involved. 
Living in a culture not my own suddenly 
seemed unnatural. It was as if the group had 
withdrawn into itself, and I was left outside. 
Pulong recovered; the normal daily life was 
resumed and I lost this feeling. But during 
Pulong's illness and in similar emergencies, I 
knew that no matter how intimate and friendly 
I was with the natives, I was never truly a part 
of their lives. 
Another crisis occurred when I was in 
Logagon for Malanggan rites. On the after­
noon of the second day there, my Lesu friends, 
a large number of whom were at Logagon, 
were extremely cool to me; they were polite, 
but the easy friendliness had disappeared. I 
was puzzled and concerned. I tried to think of 
something I might have done to offend them, 
but could recall nothing. Then the rites began 
and, as usual, I took notes; but I worried about 
what had caused the strange unfriendliness. 
That night, Kuserek told me the reason. The 
Lesu people felt that I had betrayed their con­
fidence by reporting a case of sickness to a gov­
ernment medical patrol. 
Earlier that day, two Lesu men, arriving for 
the rites, had stopped at my house to chat. 
Giving me news from Lesu, they mentioned 
that Mimis, a young girl, had been afflicted 
with the "big sickness." An epidemic causing 
the death or paralysis of natives had begun to 
sweep the island. The people called it the "big 
sickness. ,, 1 Seven people had died of it in a 
village six miles from Lesu. Before I left for 
Logagon there were no cases in Lesu. Natu­
rally, I was worried about its spread to Lesu. 
While I wondered what to do, a medical patrol 
from Kavieng drove down the road in a lorry. 
I dashed out of the house, yelling at them to 
stop. Finally they heard me and I told them 
about the sick girl in Lesu. They said they were 
going all the way to the southern end of the 

70 HORTENSE POWDERMAKER 
island, and would stop in Lesu on their way 
back and take the girl to the Kavieng hospital, 
if she were still alive. I walked back to the 
house, relieved that I had been able to report 
the sick girl to a medical patrol. 
But my Lesu friends had a very different 
impression of this incident, which they had 
witnessed. For them, the Kavieng hospital was 
only a place in which death occurred, and if 
they were going to die, they preferred to do so 
in their own home. (Ill people were so far 
advanced in their sickness when they entered 
the hospital that they usually did die there.) 
By reporting the sick girl to the patrol, I 
was sending her to die in Kavieng, far from 
relatives. 
Stunned by this version of the affair, I imme­
diately went over to where a group of Lesu 
men, many of them trusted friends and infor­
mants, were sitting, and began to explain. 
They listened politely, said nothing, and turned 
the conversation to a different topic. Feeling 
helpless, I decided to let the matter drop for a 
few days. Everyone was busy with the rites, 
and I went about taking notes, wondering 
when I should try to reopen the subject. Then 
one evening when I was with Ongus and a 
few people whom I thought had trusted me, 
I began again. I gave the facts simply and 
clearly: the horrors of the "big sickness" and 
the seven deaths in a nearby village, all of 
which they knew. I said that I was concerned 
that the people of Lesu did not die in the same 
manner; that I did not know whether Mimis 
would live or die in the Kavieng hospital, but 
her absence from the village would at least 
prevent other Lesu people from catching the 
"big sickness'' from her. I explained as well as 
I could the meaning of contagion. All this I 
repeated several times. The men listened and 
apparently understood the general point. The 
former friendliness returned. 
The climax came several months later. 
Mimis returned from the Kavieng hospital, 
well, except for a slight limp. At a small feast 
to honor her homecoming I smiled inwardly 
when speeches were made stressing that I was 
responsible for her being alive. 
An incident which might have been inter­
preted by outsiders to mean that the Lesu 
people thought I was one of them occurred 
when I was feeling a bit indisposed and tired, although not sick. I decided to take the day off. 
Kuserek dragged my cot out to the veranda 
and I lay on it, alternating reading with sleep­
ing. In the late afternoon, Ongus came over 
and said that he was very sorry to hear of my 
illness and my approaching death. Startled, I 
hastily told him that I was not going to die. 
But he insisted the end was near. The cry of a 
certain bird, believed to be an omen of death, 
had been heard in the village, and the meaning 
was evident. Ongus then assured me that I did 
not have to worry. Since my own relatives were 
far away, "my" dan would take the responsi­
bility for providing the proper mortuary rites. 
I got up immediately and walked about the 
village so that everyone could see that I was 
decidedly alive, and not begin preparation for 
my mortuary ritual. The attitudes of Ongus 
and of "my" clan did not mean that they 
regarded me as one of them, but rather that to 
them it was unthinkable for any human being 
not to have the proper rites after death. My 
new friends liked me, knew that my real rela­
tives were far away, and therefore planned to 
do the "honors." 
It never occurred to me or to the Melanesians 
that I was going "native." Understanding 
between people is, usually, a two-way process. 
I had told my Melanesian friends something 
about my family and explained my customs as 
those of my society; and they knew the func­
tion of my living in 'tesu - to understand their 
society. Beyond our differences in culture, they 
seemed to perceive and understand me as a 
human being in much the same way that I 
perceived them as human beings. Preliterate 
people are usually able to size up an anthro­
pologist as a person, understand his role, and 
become his friends if they like him, though his 
skin is of a different color and he comes from 
a strange culture. Likewise, they quickly spot 
the phoniness of an anthropologist who thinks 
or pretends that he is really one of them. 
Long after I left Lesu, I was told about a 
couple - both anthropologists -who had 
worked among an Indian tribe in South 
America. The wife decided she wanted to "go 
native" and left her husband for a short time 
to live with an Indian family. She slept in their 
house, dressed as they did, ate the same food, 
and, in general, tried to live the native life. At 
the end of an agreed-upon period, her husband 

-A WOMAN GOING NATIVE 71 
and his colleague called for her. As she climbed 
into their truck with a sigh of relief, her Indian 
host winked broadly at her husband. He and 
his family had been humoring her play-acting. 
[ ... ] 
XVIII White Society 
My life was not segregated, but it was com­
partmentalized into Negro and white spheres. 
Living in a white boarding house gave me a 
base in the white community. My fellow 
boarders and I ate three meals a day together, 
and in addition to good food, I absorbed local 
news and gossip and was continuously aware 
of the behavior and attitudes of a half-dozen 
white people. On the other hand, I paid the 
price of being unable to get away from the 
I research. 
The boarders and my landlady seemed to 
accept me even though they knew I broke the 
social title taboo. Mrs Wilson phoned occa­
_sionally, usually at meal time, since she knew I 
was apt to be home then. The phone was in the 
hall and conversations could be heard any­
where on the first floor. Whoever answered 
the phone would caB out to me, "Annie's on 
the phone." I knew Mrs Wilson had heard the 
"Annie" and I began, "Good morning, Mrs 
Wilson." I could feel the strained silence at the 
table in the next room. Our phone conversa­
tions were brief, making an appointment or 
changing the time for one. My fellow boarders 
had all told me that "Annie knew her place" 
and this belief probably kept them from being 
more disturbed by my calling her "Mrs." 
Knowledge of the white people I obtained in 
different ways: systematic interviewing, con­
siderable informal participation, and an atti­
tude questionnaire administered toward the 
end of the study. My original plan had called 
for studying only the behavior and attitudes of 
white people in their relations with Negroes. 
But I soon realized that it was not possible to 
understand these relations without knowing 
more about the class system and the traditions 
and history of white society. It never occurred 
to me not to expand the study, within the 
limits of the available time. 
Planters were systematically interviewed. 
The sample included those with "mean" and "good" reputations, solvent and insolvent; 
many were owners of the plantations on which 
I bad interviewed sharecroppers and renters. 
Interviews with the planters were almost 
always by appointment; I did not write during 
them, but always immediately afterwards, as 
was my custom with Negroes. The frankness 
of the "mean" planters surprised me. One 
opened his books and, boastingly, showed how 
he cheated his sharecroppers. He admired his 
own cleverness, and was apparently so much 
a part of his social milieu that he was unaware 
of, or unconcerned about, other values. 
However , other planters rationalized their 
behavior with the commonly-held belief that a 
"nigger" had to be kept in debt or on a sub­
sistence level in order to get him to work. 
Whatever the planter said, I maintained the 
"poker face" of an interviewer, and expressed 
only interest which was real, and an assumed 
na'ivete. 
Before coming south I had known that 
Negroes had no political or legal rights. But 
the total absence of economic rights was a 
minor shock. I had not before known of such 
a society. Tribal societies had their well-defined 
rules and customs of reciprocity. The Middle 
Ages, of which the South reminded me in some 
ways, had an established system of duties and 
responsibilities between lords and serfs. But 
the rules on which the sharecropping system 
was based were broken more often than 
followed. 
Much of my data and understanding of the 
white people came from a seemingly casual 
social participation with the middle-aged and 
older people in Indianola. I did not participate 
in the parties of young unmarried people, 
because I could not take the heavy consump­
tion of corn liquor, and going to them would 
also have necessitated a boy-friend, which, as 
already indicated, would have been disastrous 
to working with Negroes. 
I was invited to white people's homes, and 
used the occasions to direct the conversation 
along the lines of my sociological interests. 
Sometimes useful information came up spon­
taneously. Each social visit or any encounter 
giving data was written up as soon as I was 
back in my room. Women invited me to after­
noon bridge parties; since I did not know how 
to play bridge, I dropped in on a party now

and then for sociability in the late afternoon 
when refreshments were being served. More 
rewarding for data were an afternoon visit or 
lunch with a woman alone, and dinner or 
supper with a family. When I dined at a white 
person's home, I usually knew the servant who 
waited on the table. We exchanged only a 
quick knowing look. I may have interviewed 
her, had refreshments in her home, or been 
with her on some other social occasion. I could 
trust her and she could trust me not to reveal 
our relationship. I was often amazed at the 
freedom with which my white host and hostess 
talked in front of their Negro servant. It was 
as if she did not really exist. The Negroes' 
awareness of the realities of white society was 
no accident. 
White people talked freely about themselves, 
including their feelings and attitudes towards 
Negroes. Revealing also were their frank 
opinions about white neighbors and friends. 
Planters were described as "mean" or "good" 
to their sharecroppers; these evaluations 
usually agreed with those given by Negroes. 
The "mean," as well as the "good," planter 
might be an elder in the church, and this situ­
ation was regarded as normal. My host and 
hostess did not seem to notice, or did not care, 
that I said little and never expressed an 
opinion. They were pleased - and, perhaps, 
flattered -that I was genuinely interested in 
what they had to say. 
Conversation about family background was 
always a source of data. Almost everyone 
boasted about having an ancestor who had 
been a Colonel in the Confederate Army, and 
tried to give an impression of being descended 
from men who had big plantations with a large 
number of slaves. Common sense told me that 
the Confederate Army must have had more 
privates than Colonels; reading had informed 
me that in the whole pre-Civil War South, not 
more than 25 per cent of the people had owned 
any slaves and the majority of these had owned 
but one or two. Only about 6 per cent had as 
many as twenty slaves. Since Mississippi was 
settled late, the percentages were probably 
even smaller in that state. 
The pretenses to an aristocratic backgro und, 
which could also be called fantasies or lies, 
were significant data on cultural values in the 
community. Lies frequently reveal much about the values of a society, even when the field­
worker can not check on them. The situation 
in Mississippi, in which it happened to be pos­
sible to distinguish between the equally impor­
tant lie and fact disclosed two related points: 
the absence of a middle-class tradition, and the 
white peoples' burden in carrying a tradition 
that did not belong to them. 
Having perceived these points in listening to 
fantasies about family background, I gained 
evidence of them in other places. For instance, 
the whites talked condescendingly about a 
planter from Ohio who was openly a middle­
class farmer and without pretense to a higher 
social background. His late father, he said, had 
been a dirt farmer in Ohio. When I interviewed 
this miawestern immigrant to Mississippi, he 
was in overalls, doing manual work. This was 
completely atypical for a white planter. The 
man from Ohio owned one of the few solvent 
plantations in the county; he had a good rep­
utation among the Negroes and his sharecrop­
pers were busy all year long, rather than only 
during the short planting and picking seasons. 
He planted other crops besides cotton, and 
had an extensive and profitable peach orchard. 
As I had a cup of coffee with him and his wife 
at the end of the interview, he mentioned that 
he had little in common with his fellow 
planters and his wife said she had almost no 
contact with their wives. 
White women as well as men thought all 
manual work beneath them. Some who were 
hard up during the depression and were even 
on Federal relief employed a Negro laundress. 
The traditional American middle-class tradi­
tion of the virtue of hard work and its func­
tion in "getting ahead" was absent from this 
Mississippi community in the mid-thirties. 
However, it was not beneath a white woman's 
dignity to run her household and be a skilled 
cook. Women of the pre-Civil War aristocracy 
had run large plantations and taught house 
slaves their skills. The Negroes' term "strain­
ers," for most middle-class whites, was socio­
logically apt. While it is not difficult to 
understand why people want to pretend to a 
background to which culture gives a higher 
pres�ige than their own, it is almost axiomatic 
that this situation produces anxieties, as in 
cases of Jews denying their backgrounds, 
Negroes passing for whites, and so forth. 

A WOMAN GOING NATIVE 73 
Conversation and behavior revealed that the 
white people in this middle-class community 
also had a heavy burden of anxiety or guilt, or 
both, in reference to the Negroes. No house­
hold was without its gun. The whites seemed 
to live in fear of the tables being turned. I was 
advised to carry a gun in my car as I drove 
alone at night "across the tracks., When I 
laughingly mentioned my total ignorance of 
firearms and said that I was more afraid of 
them than of people, I was considered coura­
geous. Some women, particularly those who 
took their religion serious ly, expressed in 
hesitant manner the contradictions they 
felt between their Christian beliefs and the 
accepted code of behavior towards Negroes. 
Their obvious guilt was, I think, somewhat 
allayed by my not being interested in assessing 
blame. � can think of no worse technique for 
getting data than making an informant feel 
guilty. 
[ ... ] 
As I mingled with the white people, with 
. values so different from my own, I was sur­
prised at my tolerance and, even more, at my 
liking some individuals. I remembered that 
when I was working in the labor movement, I 
thought that anyone who did not believe in 
trade unions as the hope of society was beyond 
the pale of my liking or even socially recog­
nizing. In Mississippi, I wondered if I would 
have been different from the other whites, if I 
had been born in this community and had 
never left it. I had learned through breaking 
the taboo on social titles for Negroes how dif­
ficult it was to go beyond the group uniformity 
and consensus. As I tried to understand the 
historical and social situation which had 
produced these white people, I occasionally 
wondered about my new self; anthropology 
had become part of my personality. But my 
values remained as strong as ever and the 
effort to understand people with an opposing 
code did not mean that I condoned it. 
Instead, I felt compassionate. The whites 
seemed to be worse off psychologically in 
many ways than the Negroes, and I sometimes 
felt that if, Heaven forbid, I had to live in Mis­
sissippi, I would prefer to be a Negro. The 
oppressed group were sure God was on their 
side and sure of their eventual victory, and had 
a sense of satisfaction in successfully disguis-ing their real attitudes and fooling the whites. 
Many of the dominant group felt either guilt 
or hypocrisy, or both, and fear. The initial 
resistance of the leading white citizens in Indi­
anola to my study clearly indicated fear of 
what I might find out, and was in sharp con­
trast to the attitudes of Negroes who wanted 
me to learn the truth. Then, too, the area for 
reality thinking was larger among the Negroes 
than for the whites. The former knew well 
their own group and the whites, both of whom 
they regarded as ordinary human beings -
good and bad. The white man's knowledge of 
Negroes was limited to opposing stereotypes : 
a child-like person always enjoying life or a 
potentially dangerous sub-human type. 
However , my compassionate attitude 
towards whites was severely jolted late one 
afternoon when I ran into a crowd of about 
twenty-five rough-looking white men with 
dogs on a country road. They separated to let 
me drive by. I stopped for a couple of minutes 
and found out what I had immediately sus­
pected. They were out to "get a nigger" who, 
they said, had raped a white woman in a 
neighboring county. He was supposed to have 
fled into Sunflower County. Shaken, I drove 
on. I knew the Negro would be lynched if 
caught. The would-be lynchers belonged to the 
poor-white group so easily distinguishable by 
their clothes and their red-tanned necks. Their 
faces, now transformed with brutality and 
hate, were frightening. 
I could make only a pretense at eating 
supper when 1 returned to the boarding house. 
My fellow boarders had heard of the alleged 
crime, and were unconcerned about the possi­
bility of lynching. It was too bad, they said, 
but after all, it was in the next count y, and 
Negroes had to be taught a lesson once in a 
while, otherwise no white woman would be 
safe. That night I could not sleep. I felt I had 
to do something to prevent a possible lynch­
ing. I saw myself as a kind of Joan of Arc on 
a white horse. But what could I do? I knew 
that an appeal to police or other authorities 
was useless. The Negro and the white men 
hunting him lived in a county where I knew no 
one. By morning I had not thought of anything 
I could do to help the Negro. At breakfast I 
saw the local paper with a headlined story 
about the "sex crime., 

74 HORTENSE POWDERMAKER 
But at least I could function as an anthro­
pologist. The Negroes in Indianola stayed 
indoors and there was no need to study their 
attitudes. But I could study the middle-class 
whites who would not have participated in a 
lynching, although they condoned it. During 
the next couple of days I walked around the 
white section of town, sat in drug stores drink­
ing Cok� with men and women, visited people 
I knew, listening all the time to what they had 
to say about the impending lynching. The story 
was almost always the same: no one believed 
in lynching, but what could one do with these 
"sex-crazed niggers ., Only one person - a 
woman -wondered if the Negro was really 
guilty. She was a_ deeply religious middle-aged 
housewife whose family background was a bit 
higher in terms of education and wealth than 
the norm in Indianola. 
The Negro man escaped to another state, 
and was not caught. The excitement died 
down. Whispers and rumors circulated that he 
had committed no crime, but had attempted to 
get back some money owed him by a white 
man, who happened at the time to be accom­
panied by a girl friend. The story of the 
Negro's attempted rape of her had been spread 
by this man. 
I felt I had won my spurs as a fieldworker. I 
had interviewed, observed, and gotten data in 
a situation which had deeply disturbed me. 
[ ... ] 
The constant participati on and observation 
among Negroes and whites had its costs, too. 
Occasionally I wondered who I was, as -I 
passed back and forth between the two groups. 
When I inadvertently "passed" for Negro, I 
would return to the boarding house and look 
in the mirror, wondering if the color of my skin 
had changed. There was always some tension 
in the situation for me. I never was sure that 
something terrible, or at least disastrous for 
my fieldwork, might not happen as Mr Smith 
had predicted. But I evidently managed fairly 
well; I do not remember having any even 
minor illness when I was in Mississippi. 
[ ... ] 
Occasionally in Indianola, I was tired and 
depressed and wondered why I had come 
there. I remember one hot August night when 
the damp heat seemed to close in on me. It was 
more oppressive than the nights in Lesu, where cool sea breezes filtered through the thatched 
roof. I lay bathed in perspiration, although 
hardly making any movement. I asked myself, 
"Why do I have to suffer this heat?" The next 
day as I was getting some interesting data, I 
had the answer: I enjoyed fieldwork more than 
any other. It was a form of experiencing life, 
of stepping beyond the boundaries of my back­
ground and society and of making the latter 
more intelligible. 
In the discussion of the Mississippi field­
work, I have occasionally touched on some of 
the differences and similarities with the Lesu 
experience, in terms of method and techniques. 
Here, I would like to emphasize a few major 
points. The culture of Lesu was sufficiently 
strange and esoteric for me to be really outside 
of my society. Although the standards of living 
in Lesu were decidedly lower than in Missis­
sippi, neither Melanesians nor I regarded this 
or any other aspect of their social organization 
as social problems -in the colloquial sense of 
presenting situations for which change was 
desirable. (Today, after the long contact with 
Japanese and Americans, as well as Australians, 
the situation might be quite different.) In Mis­
sissippi, it was impossible to escape the inher­
ent social problems. Inevitably, I viewed the 
mores, behavior, and attitudes of Negroes and 
whites from the background of the larger Amer­
ican culture in which I had been reared and in 
terms of my personal values. Yet, I did manage 
to acquire a considerable social distance from 
the Mississippi communi ty. Seeing it in histori­
cal perspective and as a kind of anachronism 
was helpful. The previous experience of being 
involved and detached in Lesu was invaluable. 
Finally, my identification with both racial 
groups and with the different classes in each 
gave me a measure of objectivity. 
Of necessity, my roles in the biracial situa­
tion and power structure of the deep South 
were more complex than in Lesu. In the latter 
place, I occasionaUy was naive; in Mississippi, 
I had sometimes to pretend to a naivete. 
In Lesu, I had no anxiety about unknown 
dangers (once I got over my initial panic). As 
far as was necessary, I followed the Melane­
sian taboos, and when I broke them, such as 
going to a men's ritual feast, it was done at 
their invitation, with their help and with the 
approval of the community. In Mississippi, I 

-. A WOMAN GOING NATIVE 75 
had to break some taboos of the white power 
structUre openly, and some secretly, never 
knowing what might happen in either case. 
"Carrying" two groups mutually hostile and 
fearful was far more difficult than the clear-cut 
role in Lesu. My involvement in the two situ­
ations was quite different. No matter how high 
the level of my empathy with the people of 
Lesu, I never wondered if I was a Melanesian 
or a Caucasian, a member of the stone�age 
society or of my own. As already mentioned, 
in Mississippi, there were times, when passing 
back and forth between the two groups, being 
identified with each and occasionally mistaken for a Negro, that I wondered what group 
I really belonged to. Psychologically, I did 
belong to both, which in some cultures other 
than Mississippi would create no problems. 
For all the differences between Lesu and 
Mississippi, many similarities existed. I was 
not only accepted in each place, but my 
presence and the study eventually taken for 
granted. In both the culture seeped into my 
bones, as I went over and over again to 
Melanesian feasts and to Mississippi churches, 
participated in the daily lives of Melanesians 
and Negroes, interviewed many people, and 
became close friends with a few.
