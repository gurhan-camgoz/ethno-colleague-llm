The Way Things Are Said 
Jeanne Favret-Saad a 
It seems that even the pure light of science requires, in order to shine, the darkness of 
zgnorance. 
Take an enthnographer: she has chosen to 
investigate contemporary witchcraft in the 
Bocage1 of Western France. She has already 
· done some fieldwork; she has a basic academic 
training; she has published some papers on the 
logic of murder, violence and insurrection in 
an altogether different, tribal society. She is 
now working in France, to avoid having to 
learn yet another difficult language. Especially 
since in her view the symbolic shaping out of 
murder or aggression -the way things are said 
in the native culture -is as important as the 
functioning of political machinery. 
The Mirror-Image of 
an Academic 
Getting ready to leave for the field, she looks 
through the scientific (and not so scientific) 
literature on contemporary witchcraft: the 
writings of folklorists and psychiatrists, of 
occultists and journalists. This is what she 
finds: that peasants, who are 'credulous', 
'backward' and impervious to 'cause of effect', 
blame their misfortune on the jealousy of a Karl Marx (1856) 
neighbour who has cast a spell on them; they 
go to an unwitcher (usually described as a 
'charlatan', now and again as 'na'lve') who 
protects them from their imaginary aggressor 
by performing 'secret' rituals which 'have no 
meaning', and 'come from another age'. The 
geographical and cultural 'isolation' of the 
Bocage is partly responsible for the 'survival' 
of these 'beliefs' in our time. 
If that is all there is to be said about witch­
craft (and however much you try to find out 
from the books of folklorists or the reports of 
trials in the French press over the last ten years, 
you will learn no more), you may wonder why 
it seems to be such an obsession. To judge by 
the public's immense curiosity, the fascination 
produced by the very word 'witchcraft', the 
guaranteed success of anything written about 
it, one wonders what journalistic scoop could 
ever find a greater public. 
Take an ethnograp her. She has spent more 
than thirty months in the Bocage in Mayenne, 
studying witchcraf t. 'How exciting, how 
thrilling, how extraordinary ... !' 'Tell us all 
about the witches,' she is asked again and

again when she gets back to the city. Just as 
one might say: tell us tales about ogres or 
wolves, about Little Red Riding Hood. 
Frighten us, but make it clear that it's only a 
story; or that they are just peasants: credulous, 
backward and marginal. Or alternatively: 
confirm that out there there are some people 
who can bend the laws of causality and moral­
ity, who can kill by magic and not be punished; 
but remember to end by saying that they do 
not really have that power: they only believe it 
because they are credulous, backward peasants 
... (see above). 
No wonder that country people in the West 
are not in any hurry to step forward and be 
taken for idiots in the way that public opinion 
would have them be-whether in the scholarly 
version developed by folklorists, or in the 
equally hard faced popular version spread by 
the media. 
To say that one is studying beliefs abo�t 
witchcraf t is automatically to deny them any 
truth: it is just a belief, it is not true. So folk­
lorists never ask of country people: 'what are 
they trying to express by means of a witchcraft 
crisis?', but only 'what are they hiding from 
us?' They are led on by the idea of some 
healer's 'secret', some local trick, and describ­
ing it is enough to gratify academic curiosity. 
So witchcraf t is no more than a body of empty 
recipes (boil an ox heart, prick it with a thou­
sand pins, etc.)? Grant that sort of thing super­
natural power? How gullible can you be? 
Similarly, when the reporter, that hero of 
positivist discourse, goes along on behalf of a 
public assumed to be incredulous, and asks 
country people whether they 'still believe' in 
spells, the case is decided in advance: yes, 
people do still believe in spells, especially if 
you go to the Lower Berry or the Normandy 
Bocage. How convenient that there should be 
a district full of idiots, where the whole realm 
of the imaginary can be held in. But country 
people are not fools: they meet these advances 
wirh obsrinate silence. 
But even their silence about things to do 
with witchcraf t; and more generally about 
anything to do with illness and death, is said 
to tell us about their status: 'their language is 
roo simple', 'they are incapable of symboliz­
ing', you won't get anytrung out of them 
because 'they don't talk': that is what I was told by the local scholarly elite. Why not say 
they are wild men of the woods, since they live 
in a 'bocage'; animals, even? 'Medicine is a vet­
erinary art round here' a local psychjatris t 
once told me. 
So all that was known about witchcraf t is 
that it was unknowable: when I left for the 
field, knowledge of the subje ct boiled down to 
this. The first question I asked myself when I 
met the peasants, who were neither credulous 
nor backward, was: is witchcraf t unknowable, 
or is it just that those who say this need to 
block out all knowledge about it in order to 
maintain their own intellectual coherence? 
Does the 'scholar' or the 'man of our own age' 
need to comfort himself with the myth of a 
credulous and backward peasant? 
The social sciences aim to account for cul­
tural differences. But can this be achieved by 
postulating the existence of a peasant who is 
denied all reality save that he is the mirror­
image of an academic? 
Whenever folklorists or reporters talk of 
witchcraf t in the country, they always do so as 
if one were facing two incompatible physical 
theories: the pre-logical or medieval attitude of 
peasants, who wrongly attribute their misfor­
tunes to imaginary witches; and ours, the atti­
tude of educated people who know how ro 
handle causal relations correctly. It is said or 
implied that peasants are incapable of this 
either because of ignorance or of backward­
ness. In this respect, the description given of 
the peasant and the 'pays', the canton, that 
determines him is governed by a peculiar ser 
of terms which necessarily imply that he is 
incapable of grasping causal relations. Witch­
craft is put forward as a nonsense theory 
which peasants can afford to adopt because it 
is the local theory. The folklorist's job is then 
to underline the difference between his own 
theory (which also happens to be a 'true' one) 
and the peasant's, which is only a belief. 
But who can ignore the difficulties involved 
in postulating the coexistence of two incom­
patible physical theories which correspond to 
two ages of humankind? Do you really have 
to do thirty months of fieldwork to be in a 
position to say that country people are just as 
well able to cope with causal relations as 
anyone else, and to make the suggestion that 
witchcraf t cannot be reduced to a physical 

THE WAY THINGS ARE SAID 467 
theory, although it does indeed imply a certain 
kind of causality? 
II Words Spoken 
with Insistence 
I began by studying the words used to express 
biological misfortunes, and used in ordinary 
conversation: about death, sterility, and illness 
in animals and humans. The first thing one 
notices is that they distinguish between ordi­
nary misfortunes and their extraordinary 
repetition. 
In the Bocage, as anywhere else in France, 
ordinary misfortunes are accepted as 'one-off'; 
so, a single illness, the loss of one animal, one 
bankruptcy, even one death, do not call for 
more than a single comment: 'the trouble with 
him is 'that he drinks too much'; 'she had 
cancer of the kidneys'; 'my cow was very old'. 
An onslaught by witchcraf t, on the other 
hand, gives a pattern to misfortunes which 
are repeated and range over the persons and 
belongings of a bewitched couple: in succes­
sion, a heifer dies, the wife has a miscarriage, 
the child is covered in spots, the car runs into 
a ditch, the butter won't churn, the bread 
won't rise, the geese bolt, or the daughter they 
want to marry off goes into a decline ... Every 
morning, the couple ask anxiously: 'What on 
earth will happen next?' And every time some 
misfortune occurs: always unexpected, always 
inexplicable. 
When misfortunes occur like this in series, 
the countryman approac hes qualified people 
with a double request: on the one hand for an 
interpreta tion, and on the other for a cure. 
The doctors and vets answer him by denying 
the existence of any series: illnesses, deaths and 
mechanical breakdowns do not occur for the 
same reasons and are not treated in the same 
way. These people are the curators of objective 
knowledge about the body, and they can claim 
to pick off one by one the causes of the 
misfortunes: go and disinfect your stables, 
vaccinate your cows, send your wif e to the 
gynaecologist, give your child milk with less 
fat in it, drink less alcohol ... But however 
effective each separate treatment may be, in 
the eyes of some peasants it is still incomplete, 
for it only affects the cause and not the origin of their troubles. The origin is always the evil 
nature of one or more witches who hunger 
after other people's misfortunes, and whose 
words, look and touch have supernatural 
power. 
Faced with a bewitched, one can imagine 
that the priest is in a more awkward situation 
than the doctor, for evil, misfortune and the 
supernatural mean something to him. But what 
they mean has become singularly blurred by 
many centuries of theological brooding. The 
dividing line between the ranges of the natural 
and the supernatural has been fixed by 
Catholic orthodoxy; but the reasons given have 
scarcely been assimilated, especially since each 
late pronouncement does not categorically 
cancel former ones. So theological knowledge 
is no more unified in the mind of a country 
priest than it is in the body of doctrine. 
Hearing the various stories told in his 
parish, the priest can choose between three dif­
ferent and mutually exclusive types of inter­
pretation: 
1 He can dismiss these misfortunes as part 
of the natural order, and so deny them any reli­
gious significance: by doing so he sides with 
medical ideology, and in effect says the 
bewitched are raving or superstitious people. 
2 He can acknowledge that these misfor­
tunes do pertain to the supernatural order, but 
are an effect of divine love: so the bishop of 
Seez preaches 'good suffering' to a congrega­
tion of 'luckless' peasants. A universally aimed 
(Catholic) discourse can turn him who is 'luck­
less' into the most lucky. The man whom God 
loves best and so chastises, is only a victim in 
the eyes of the world. This reversal of appear­
ances sometimes has its effect. 
3 The priest can meet the peasant on his 
own ground and interpret his misfortunes as 
the work of the devil. He is permitted to do 
this by at least one branch or stratum of rhe­
ology. He then has two alternatives. 
He may consult, as he is supposed to, the 
diocesan exorcist, the official expert in diabol­
ical matters appointed by the hierarchy. But in 
Western France, the priest knows very well 
that he is not likely to convince the expert, 
who has held this position for thirty years pre­
cisely because he is skeptical about the devil's 
interest in so-called 'simple' peasants: you have 

468 JEANNE FAVRET-SAADA 
to be clever to interest the devil. So the dioce­
san exorcist, in the elitist style of any country 
priest who has risen in the Church or any 
peasant who has risen in society, offers the 
positivist interpretation. He refuses to give any 
religious meaning to the peasant's misfortune 
except by mentioning 'good suffering' or 
saying he will pray for him. Like the doctor, 
he refuses the peasant' s request for a meaning 
by advising the man to consult a psychiatrist, 
to live a more balanced life, and to apply better 
the rules of the experimental method. The 
village priest knows in advance that to send 
a bewitched to the diocesan exorcist is to ask 
him to take his troubles elsewhere, and in 
effect to direct him to a doctor by way of the 
ecclesiastical hierarchy. 
Alternative ly, the priest comes and exorcises 
the farm and its inhabitants without consult­
ing the hierarchy. As a more or less willing dis­
tributor of blessings and medals, holy water 
and salt, he plays the role in his parish of a 
small-scale unwitcher who protects people 
from evil speUs without sending them back to 
the witch. 
'If it's a small spell, it works': the series of 
misfortunes stops and everything returns to 
normal. It works, but the origin of the misfor­
tune and its repetition are still not satisfacto­
rily symbolized. For when the peasant talks 
about being bewitched to anyone who is 
willing to listen, what he wants acknowledged 
is this: if such repetitions occur, one must 
assume that somewhere someone wants them 
to. I shall show later that witchcraft consists 
in creating a misunderstanding about who it is 
that desires the misfortunes of the bewitched. 
Note here that the Church's rite merely clouds 
the issue by attributing the evil to some imma­
terial spirit included by half-hearted theology 
in a list of 'preternatural facts'. For the victim, 
the witch is some familiar person (a neighbour , 
for example) whose aims he can at least hope 
to discover . 
If 'it doesn't work': if the priest 'isn't strong 
enough' because his parishioner is 'caught 
tight' in the spells, the bewitched is left with 
his question: why this series of events, and why 
in my home? What is at stake here, my sanity 
or my life? Am I mad, as the doctor says, or 
does someone have it in for me to the point of 
wanting me to die? It is only at this point that the sufferer can 
choose to interpret his ills in the language of 
witchcraft. Some friend, or someone else who 
has noticed him moving deeper into misfor­
tune and seen the ineffectiveness of approved 
learning makes the crucial diagnosis: 'Do you 
think there may be someone who wishes you 
ill?' This amounts to saying: 'you're not mad, 
I can see in you the signs of a similar crisis I 
once experienced, and which came to an end 
thanks to this unwitcher.' 
The priest and the doctor have faded out 
long ago when the unwitcher is called. The 
unwitcher's task is first to authenticate his 
patient's sufferings and his feeling of being 
threatened in the flesh; second, it is to locate, 
by close examination, the patient's vulnerable 
spots. It is as if his own body and those of his 
family, his land and all his possessions make 
up a single surface full of holes, through which 
the witch's violence might break in at any 
moment. The unwitcher then clearly tells his 
client how long he still has to live if he stub­
bornly remains defenceless. He is a master of 
death; he can tell its date and how to postpone 
it. A professional in supernatural evil, he is 
prepared to return blow for blow against 'the 
person we suspect', the alleged witch, whose 
final identity is established only after an inves­
tigation, sometimes a long one. This is the 
inception of what can only be called a cure. 
The seances later are devoted to finding the 
gaps which still need sealing, as they are 
revealed day by day in the course of life. 
Ill When Words 
Wage War 
In the project for my research I wrote that I 
wanted to study witchcraft practices in the 
Bocage. For more than a century, folklorists 
had been gorging themselves on them, and 
the time had come to understand them. In the 
field, however , all I came across was language. 
For many months, the only empirical facts I 
was able to record were words. 
Today I would say that an attack of witch­
craft can be summed up as follows: a set of 
words spoken in a crisis situation by someone 
who will later be designated as a witch are 

THE WAY THINGS ARE SAID 469 
afterwards interpreted as having taken effect 
on the body and belongings of the persons 
spoken to, who will on that ground say he is 
bewitched. The unwitcher takes on himself 
these words originally spoken to his client� and 
turns them back on to their initial sender, 
the witch. Always the 'abnormal' is said to 
have settled in after certain words have been 
uttered, and the situation persists without 
change until the unwitcher places himself like 
a screen between the sender and the receiver. 
Unwitching rituals -the actual 'practices' -are 
remarkably poor and contingent: this ritual or 
that, it makes no difference, any one will do. 
For if the ritual is upheld it is only through 
words and through the person who says them. 
So perhaps, I was not entirely mistaken 
when I said I wanted to study practices: the 
act, in witchcraft, is the word. 
That may seem an elementary statement, but 
it is full of implications. The first is this: until 
now, the work of ethnographers has relied on 
a convention (one too obvious to be stated) 
. about the use of spoken words. For ethnogra­
phy to be possible, it was necessary that the 
investigator and the 'native' should at least 
agree that speech has the function of convey­
ing information. To be an ethnographer is 
first to record the utterances of appropriately 
chosen native informants. How to establish 
this information-situation, the main source of 
the investigato r's knowledge, how to choose 
one's informants, how to involve them in a 
regular working relationship ... the hand­
books always insist on this truly fundamental 
point in fieldwork. 
Now, witchcraft is spoken words; but these 
spoken words are power, and not knowledge 
or information. 
To talk, in witchcra ft, is never to inform. Or 
if information is given, it is so that the person 
who is to kill (the unwitcher) will know where 
to aim his blows. 'Informing' an ethnographer, 
that is, someone who claims to have no inten­
tion of using the information, but na·ively 
wants to know for the sake of knowing, is lit­
erally unthinkable. For a single word (and only 
a word) can tie or untie a fate, and whoever 
puts himself in a position to utter it is formi­
dable. Knowing about spells brings money, 
brings more power and triggers terror: realities 
much more fascinating to an interlocutor than the innocent accumulation of scientific knowl­
edge, writing a well-documented book, or 
getting an academic degree. 
Similarly, it is unthinkable that people can 
talk for the sake of talking. Exchanging words 
just to show that one is with other people, to 
show one's wish to commun icate, or what 
Malinowski called 'phatic communication' 
exists in the Bocage as it does anywhere else. 
But here it implies strictly political intentions: 
phatic communication is the expression of 
zero-aggressiveness; it conveys to one's inter­
locutor that one might launch a magic rocket 
at him, but that one chooses not to do so for 
the time being. It is conveying to him that this 
is not the time for a fight, but for a cease-fire. 
When interlocutors for whom witchcraf t is 
involved talk about nothing (that is about 
anything except what really matters) it is to 
emphasize the violence of what is not being 
talked about. More fundamentally , it is to 
check that the circuit is functioning, and that 
a state of war does indeed hold between the 
opponents. 
In short, there is no neutral position with 
spoken words: in witchcraf t, words wage war. 
Anyone talking about it is a belligerent, the 
ethnographer like everyone else. There is no 
room for uninvolved observers. 
When Evans-Pritchard, founder of the 
ethnography of witchcraf t, studied the Zande, 
he made it his practice to interpret the events 
of his life by means of schemes about persecu­
tion, consulting oracles and submitting to their 
decisions: 'I was aided in my understanding of 
the feelings of the bewitched Azande', he says, 
'by sharing their hopes and joys, apathy and 
sorrows [ .. . ]. In no department of their ljfe 
was I more successful in "thinking black" or 
as it should more correctly be said "feeling 
black" than in the sphere of witchcraft. I, too, 
used to react to misfortunes in the idiom of 
witchcraf t, and it was often an effort to check 
this lapse into unreason' (1937). But we learn 
from his book that actually the Zande had 
given him the position of 'Prince without port­
folio', which is no slight consolation if one 
remembers that in Zande society, a prince can 
only be bewitched by another prince (a rather 
reassuring thought for an ethnographer 
established many miles from the court) and 
that by not giving him a portfolio, the Zande 

. 
. 
470 JEANNE FAVRET-SAADA 
were exempting Evans-Pritchard from having 
to play the role, so important for the effec­
tiveness of the cure, of symbolic guarantee of 
the return to order. 
In other words, the ethnographer could not 
himself possibly be involved in a case of witch­
craft.3 In the Bocage, the situation happens to 
be less comfortable: nobody ever talks about 
witchcraft to gain knowledge, but to gain 
power. The same is true about asking ques­
tions. Before the ethnographer has uttered a 
single word, he is involved in the same power 
relationship as anyone else talking about it. 
Let him open his mouth, and his interlocutor 
immediately tries to identify his strategy, 
estimate his force, guess if he is a friend or foe, 
or if he is to be bought or destroyed. As 
with any other interlocut or, speaking to the 
ethnographer one is addressing either a 
subjed supposed to be able (a witch, an 
unwitcher) or unable (a victim, a bewitche� 
person). 
It follows that wanting to know could only 
be -for me as for anyone else -in the name 
of a force which I claim to have or which my 
interlocutor credits me with. If I were not 
equipped to confront it, no one would believe 
I could survive unharmed, or even survive it at 
all. 
'Are you strong enough?' I was often asked 
when I tried to establish an information­
relationship, that is to get people who had 
experience of witch stories to tell me about 
them. A mere desire for information is the sign 
of a nai've or hypocritical person who must at 
once be frightened off. The effect that the 
person telling the story is trying to achieve is 
either to fascinate or to frighten: nobody would 
talk about it who did not hope to fascinate. If 
my interlocutor is successful, he says I have 
'weak blood' and advises me to change my 
course of research towards folk song or the 
ancient papegai festival. If he fears that he has 
not brought it off, he anxiously asks me how I 
can bear to hear such stories every day, 
and offers various assumptions: 'You've got 
strong blood', or else 'you've got something' 
(to protect yourself with). He then tries to iden­
tify my fetishes, to find out whether or not they 
are •stronger' than his own. Otherwise, he may 
identify me with a certain unwitcher who has 
just died, a double-edged compliment which I am bound to appreciate: to say that my 'hands 
tremble like Madame Marie's' means that, like 
her, I'm 'quite strong'-but also that in the end 
she met her master in witchcraf t, and he did 
away with her quite recently. 
As you can see, this is not exactly a standard 
situation, in which information is exchanged 
and where the ethnographer may hope to have 
neutral knowledge about the beliefs and prac­
tices of witchcraft conveyed to him. For he 
who succeeds in a acquiring such knowledge 
gains power and must accept the effects of this 
power; the more one knows, the more one is 
a threat and the more one is magically threat­
ened. So long as I claimed the usual status of 
an ethnograp her, saying I wanted to know for 
the sake of knowing, my interlocutors were 
less eager to commun icate their own knowl­
edge than to test mine, to try to guess the nec­
essarily magic use I intended to put it to, and 
to develop their force to the detriment of my 
own. I had to accept the logic of this totally 
combative situation and admit that it was 
absurd to continue to posit a neutral position 
which was neither admissible or even credible 
to anyone else. When total war is being waged 
with words, one must make up one's mind to 
engage in another kind of ethnography.4 
[ ... ] 
II A Name Added to 
a Position 
In pursuing the ethnography of spells, the first 
point to grasp is being clear about whom each 
'informant' thinks he is speaking to, since 
he utters such radically different discourses 
depending on the position he thinks his inter­
locutor holds. To someone who 'isn't caught', 
he will say: 'spells don't exist'; 'they no longer 
exist'; 'that was in the old days'; 'they were 
true for our back people'; 'they exist, but not 
here: go and look in Saint-Mars (or Montjean, 
or Lassay: somewhere else ... ) rover there, 
they're really backward'; 'oh, spells! I don't 
hold with all that rot!'. To someone who 
is 'caught', one speaks in a different way, 
depending on whether the person is given the 
position of bewitched or unwitcher . (No one 
talks to the alleged witch, but this very silence 
is in itself a whole discourse, the silent asser-

THE WAY THINGS ARE SAID 471 
cion of a fight to the death, which always has 
some effect.) 
When an ethnographer works in an exotic 
field, he too has to take up some sort of stance. 
But common sense and the handbooks point 
out the virtues of distance and the advantages 
to be derived from the status of rich cannibal. 
To claim, on the other hand, that one wants to 
hear about peasant witchcraf t yet remain alien 
to it is to condemn oneself to hearing only 
objectivist statements and to collecting fantas­
tic anecdotes and for unwitching recipes -i.e. 
to accumulate statements which the stating 
subject formally disavows. So for the last 
hundred and fifty years, the native and the 
folklorist have been looking at themselves in a 
mirror each has held up to the other, without 
the folklorist apparently ever noticing the 
ironic complicity that this implies on the part 
of the native. 
When I left for the Socage, I was certainly 
in no better position than any of my predeces­
sors, except that I thought their findings trivial 
compared with the reality at stake in a witch­
craft attack. Within a few months I had myself 
done much the same collecting as they; it left 
me unsatisfied, and gave me no guidance about 
how to pursue my investigation. It would have 
been just as futile for me to try and win over 
the peasants with large-minded statements of 
good intention, since anyway, in matters of 
witchcraft, it is always the other person who 
decides how to interpret what you say. Just as 
a peasant must hear the words of the annun­
ciator, if he is to confess that he is indeed 
bewitched, so it was my interlocutors who 
decided what my position was ('caught' or 
not, bewitched or unwitcher) by interpreting 
unguarded clues in my speech.5 
I must point out that I knew nothing about 
this system of positions, and that the main part 
of my work has been to make it out little by 
little by going back over puzzling episodes. For 
several months my notes describe a number 
of situations in which my interlocutors placed 
me in this stance or that ('not caught', 
'caught' -bewitched, 'caught' -unwitcher) 
although at the time I did not see anything 
but a classic situation of ethnographic investi­
gation, even if a somewhat difficult one 
because I was after something particularly 
secret. I was probably not yet ready to maintain 
this speech process in the only way conceivable 
to my interlocutors: by accepting that being 
given such a stance committed me to utter my 
part in this discourse in the same way as they 
did. Of course this position existed before me 
and was acceptably occupied and maintained 
by others. But now I was the one being placed 
there, and my name was being attached to this 
position as well as to my particular personal 
existence. 
Although I went through the whole experi­
ence in a state of some confusion, I can say 
today that it is actually patterned around a 
small number of characteristic situations in 
which my interlocutors required me to occupy 
a position that they indicated. They were con­
veying that they had no need of my ability to 
listen, for what mattered to them was not 
merely to be understood, or, in the language of 
commun ication-theory-they had no need for 
a decoder. In witchcraft, to receive messages 
obliges one to send our other, signed messages: 
it was time for me to speak. 
For example, here are some instances of the 
manner in which 1 was put ro rhe test: ( 1) the 
first time that the bewitched told me their own 
story (and not that of some hypothetical 'back­
ward people'), ir was because they had identi­
fied me as the unwitcher who could get them 
out of their troubles. (2) A few months later, a 
peasant interpreted my 'weakness', took on the 
role of annunciator of my state as a bewitched, 
and took me to his unwitcher to get me 
'uncaught'. (3) For more than two years, I sub­
jected the events of my personal life to the 
interpretations of this unwitcher. ( 4) Several 
bewitched asked me to 'uncatch' them. 
Although at this point I had become quite 
competent ar handling magical discourse, I felt 
quite incapable of taking the speech-position 
upholding it, and I sent them on to my thera­
pist. (5) Lastly, this unwitcher , with whom 
I had a complicated relationship (I was her 
client, agent, and guarantor of the truth of her 
words during the cures in which I was invited 
to participate) instructed me to bring her a 
healer who would relieve her of her bodily 
pains and to assist him in his task. 
You could say, given the ideal assumption 
that I might have made my choice in full 
consciousness of the situation, that every rime

these were the alternatives: either I refused this 
assignment of my identity to a position and 
withdrew from the speech process pointing out 
that I was being mistaken for someone I was 
not (I am not who you think I am); or I agreed 
to occupy the position assigned to me, unless 
1 could propose some other which I felt more 
able to occupy (I am not where you think I 
am). In the first case, I would have had to leave 
the Bocage, where I no longer had any place; 
in the second, the speech process would go 
on but I had to place myself in the position of 
subject of the enunciation. 
It emerges from the asides of investigators 
that I was not the first person to be offered this 
alternative. Some folklorists, for example, tell 
of their amusement at having been invited, at 
one point or another, to act as unwitchers. This 
type of occurrence is worth looking into. Note 
in the first place, that it is out of the question 
for the investigator to be assigned the position 
of bewitched. He would have had to give some 
sign that he knows he is mortal, vulnerable or 
at least subject to desires -all things one can 
freely admit, but only to dose relations and 
in confidence -certainly not to uneducated 
farmers and while practising one's profession. 
In the field, the investigator therefore routinely 
presents himself to his interlocutor as someone 
who does not lack anything: or to take up the 
expression I used above, he displays a contin­
uous surface without holes in it. Everything in 
his behaviour suggests he is 4Strong enough '. 
This especially since he does not omit argu­
ments likely to loosen their tongues: he may 
say he belongs to a local line of magic healers 
(he might claim, for example, that his mater­
nal grandmoth er, who is still remembered in 
the area, 4passed the secret' on to him); and in 
his conversations with 'informers', he shows 
he knows many unwitchment recipes, magic 
formulae and fantastic anecdotes. Without 
being conscious of it, the investigator has done 
everything necessary for his interlocutors to 
assign him the position of unwit cher. But if he 
is actually told this, and asked to perform, he 
is amused. He recounts this episode as if it 
were just an entertaining anecdote, and a par­
ticularly conclusive evidence of peasant gulli­
bility, to a listener who is confidently assumed 
to feel equally superior. Indeed, there is cause 
to smile: there has been an error, a mis.taken identity, the investigator was not the person he 
was thought to be. 
But one may wonder who is more naive, the 
peasant or the folklorist. The former cannot 
understand that one might collect formulae 
without putting them to any use, just for the 
sake of information; the latter judges that 
he has satisfied the demands of science by 
collecting information, without realizing he 
cannot do anything with it, neither science nor 
mag1c. 
Not science: the folklorists failed to recog­
nize the existence and role of the power of 
therapists in unwitching cures. They strained 
to find out what these therapists knew, and this 
in the particular form of secrets to be collected. 
In other words, whatever in their discourse 
most resembles an utterance, a statement 
which can stand on its own independent of the 
stating subject. 
The content of the secret (the utterance) is 
for the most part neither here nor there: it does 
not matter whether one is told to pierce an ox 
heart, twist steel nails, or recite misappropri­
ated Church prayers. Magicians know this, 
when they quietly say: 4tO each one his secret', 
and show themselves in no hurry to increase 
their knowledge. For what makes an 
unwitcher is his 'force' and its links with a 
world of language (the very one which pro­
duced the content of the secret). The power of 
the magician, thus referred to a symbolic 
set, places him in the position of recognized 
avenger (and not, for example, of a criminal 
settling private scores), but on condition that 
he openly declares his readiness to assume this 
position. 
Not magic: unwitching does not consist in 
uttering formulae or practising magic rituals. 
If they are to have any chance of being effec­
tive, a set of positions must first be established, 
by which someone who is not the magician 
places him in the position of subject supposed 
to be able; and the magician himself must 
acknowledge he is in it, and accept what this 
implies in terms of personal commitment to a 
discourse, and of assuming the effects of magic 
speech on his own body and so on. 
So when the folklorist reacts to a request 
for unwitchment by laughing as if this were an 
inappropriate proposal, and excuses himself 
by saying he cannot do anything, or by sending 

THE WAY THINGS ARE SAID 473 
the patient to his doctor, the peasant gathers 
that this academic does not want to commit 
his 'force', if he has any; or more likely, that 
he has no idea what 'force' is or just how much 
is involved in speaking. The folklorist's mirth 
simply shows that he does not think he can 
cure anyone with magic formulae, and that for 
him such knowledge is pointless. And so it is, 
unless a subject agrees to become the support 
of these magic utterances and to proffer them 
in the name of his own 'force' taken as part 
of a symbolic univ erse -i.e. to convert this 
knowledge into a power. 
Ill Taking On e's Distances 
from Whom (or What)? 
So one 'cannot study witchcraf t without agree­
ing to take part in the situations where it man­
ifests itself, and in the discourse expressing it. 
This entails certain limitations which will 
seem most unwelcome to those who favour an 
objectivizing ethnography . 
1 You cannot verify any assertion: first 
because there is no position of impartial 
witness in this discourse. Second, because it 
is pointless to question outsiders: to be 
bewitched is to have stopped communicating 
with one's presumed witch as well as with 
anyone not involved in the crisis; so other vil­
lagers know almost nothing of the matter. 
Finally, it is inconceivable that an ethnogra­
pher to whom someone had spoken as to the 
legitimate occupier of one of the positions in 
the discourse might step outside it to investi­
gate, and ask what is the truth behind this or 
that story. 
2 You cannot hear both parties -the 
bewitched and their alleged witches -since 
they no longer communicate. Not only do they 
not talk to each other, they do not speak the 
same kind of language. If, exceptionally , it 
were ever possible to obtain both versions of 
the same story, they could not be set face to 
face, since witches always claim that they do 
not believe in spells, object to the discourse of 
witchcraft , and appeal to the language of pos­
itivism.6 In any case, the bewitched prevent 
any such confrontation by warning the ethno-grapher to avoid meeting their aggressor, for 
fear of becoming his victim. To take no notice 
of this advice would be a sign either of dis­
turbing masochism, or of a rash faith in the 
powers protecting you, or indeed of an inten­
tion to work some betrayal. Note that such 
daring would be just as disturbing to the 
'witch', however imaginary he may be: 
knowing that the ethnographer sees people 
who call themselves his victims, he would, on 
receiving a visit from this stranger, see him as 
an unwitcher come to fight him. In rime of 
war, nothing so resembles the characteristic 
weapons of the magician (words, look and 
touch) as an innocent 'how are you?' followed 
by a handshake. 
3 One cannot investigate in one's own 
�quartier' [neighbourhood] so dreaded is the 
magic effectiveness of speech. The peasant 
thinks it wise to maintain a certain distance 
between the speaker and the listener, to 
prevent the latter from taking advantage of the 
situation. A serious crisis will never be taken 
ro the local unwitcher. People prefer ro choose 
their therapist beyond some boundary (in a 
neighbouring diocese or departeme nt), in any 
case outside the network of acquaintanceship. 
For this reason, I never worked less than ten 
kilometres from where I was living. So in 
general, I remained unaware of the sociologi­
cal context of witchcraft matters and especially 
of the particular positions of the opponents 
in the local struggles for prestige and power -
and these usually constitute the subject­
matter of ethnographic invesrigarions inro 
witchcraft. 
4 One cannot set up any strategy of obser­
vation (even a 'participating' one) which keeps 
the agreed amount of distance that this 
implies. More generally , to claim an external 
position for oneself is to abandon hope of ever 
learning this discourse: first (remember) 
because those concerned react with silence or 
duplicity to anyone who claims to be outside. 
But more profoundly because any attempt at 
making things explicit comes up against a 
much more formidable barrier: that of the 
native's amnesia and his incapacity to formu­
late what must remain unsaid. These are the 
limits of what one can ask a willing informer 
(in so far as such persons exist in the Socage), 
and they are soon reached. 

474 JEANNE FAVRET-SAADA. 
To take one example: if you want to know 
the substance of a diviner's consultation, you 
can simply ask him what usually takes place in 
a seance, or what his clients consult him about. 
But you should not be surprised at trivial 
answers: 'They come because of illness, love 
affairs, animals, to recover money they have 
lost ... ' -'And what about spells?' -'That 
might be the case, but I don't deal with that' 
will be tlie diviner's systematic reply. A barrier, 
then, of silence and duplicity: the diviner 
can only admit 'dealing with that' in front of 
someone who puts forward a personal request 
for divination. About the seances, on the other 
hand, he claims he honestly has nothing more 
to impart than a few matters of technique: 'I 
begin with the game of piquet and go on to 
tarot cards.' -'But how do you guess their 
story?'-'Well, I have the gift.' Even when the 
ethnographer 's questions are more subtle, they 
soon come up against the bounds of the unstat:­
able, represented here by the reference to a 
'gift'. Pressed to make himself more clear, the 
diviner can do no more than illustrate his state­
ments by recounting the enigmatic circum­
stances in which, one day, a long time ago, 
when becoming a seer had not yet entered his 
head, a patient seeking for revelations sensed 
the 'gift' in him, and announced it to the pro­
fessional diviner who then initiated him. 
If the ethnographer resorts to the patients, 
he obtains uniformly improbable statements: 
the diviner, he is told, 'reads me like an open 
book', or again, 'he's extraordina ry, I never tell 
him anything and he knows everything' . But if 
he has ever accompanied peasants to the 
diviner's and sat in the waiting room during 
the consultations, the ethnographer knows 
that they never stopped talking: it's just 
that, as after a hypnotic trance, they do not 
remember. 
So the diviner and his client have a common 
'rnisknowledge' which is not the same as the 
simple complicity of sharing a· secret: no 
winning of trust will ever make the persons 
concerned capable of explaining what the 
terms 'gift' and 'seeing everything' really mean, 
because the whole institution of divination 
depends on the fact that they do not want to 
know anything about ic 
For anyone who wants to understand the 
meaning of this discourse, there is no other solution but to practise it oneself, to become 
one's own informant, to penetrate one's own 
amnesia, and to try and make explicit what 
one finds unstatable in oneself. For it is diffi­
cult to see how the native could have any inter­
est in the project of unveiling what can go on 
existing only if it remains veiled; or for what 
purpose he would give up the symbolic bene­
fits of such important resources. 
(I am well aware that the·re is a fundamen­
tal gulf between my present aims and those of 
my Bocage interlocutors. Until now, I have 
been content to state that the discourse of 
witchcraft is such that to gain access to it one 
must be in a position to sustain it oneself. And 
yet, it is one thing to have access to it-it was 
a memorable adventure which has marked 
me for my whole subsequent life -it is 
another thing to want to go on to develop its 
theory.) 
If you want to listen to and understand a 
diviner, there is therefore no other solution but 
to become his client, i.e. to tell him your desire 
and ask him to interpret it. 7 Like any native -
or any desiring subject - the investigator is 
bound on this occasion to be afflicted by 
misknow ledge: so for several months, however 
carefully I tried to take notes after each div­
ination seance, a certain part of the consulta­
tion, always the same, was censored by 
amnesia; similarly, when a seer, who I was 
hoping would teach me the everyday tricks of 
divination saw the 'gift' in me and gave me her 
life-story for interpretation, claiming she had 
nothing to teach me that I did not already 
know, I could not help being amazed. 
Persistent amnesia, dumbfoundedness, the 
inability to reflect when faced by the seemingly 
unstatable-i.e. a vague perception that some­
thing in this cannot be coped with -this was 
my ordinary lot during the adventure.8 It may 
be wondered how, at a certain point, I 
managed to surmount this inability, that is, try 
to get it out in words, to convert an adventure 
into a theoretical project. But this question 
cannot be answered simply by invoking one's 
duty towards the demands of the scientific 
approach, or one's debt to the scholarly insti­
tution which acts as patron: if that respect 
applies, it is somewhere else and in another 
manner. To have been engaged in the discourse 

THE WAY THINGS ARE SAID 475 
of witchcraft beyond what can be required of 
an ethnographer in the ordinary practice of her 
profession poses first the problem of motive; 
what could have been my own desire to know; 
why was I personally involved in the ambition 
to give a solid basis to the 'social sciences', and 
why, in the case of divination for example, was 
I not content to resolve the issue by invoking 
the concept of 'gift', or, even sooner, by accept­
ing the findings of the folklorists. 
So the distance necessary if one is to be able 
to theorize does not have to be established 
between the ethnographer and his 'object\ i.e. 
the native. But of all the snares which might 
imperil our work, there are two we had learnt 
to avoid like the plague: that of agreeing to 
'participate' in the native discourse, and that 
of succumbing to the temptations of subjec­
tivism. Not only could I not possibly avoid 
them; 'it is by means of them that I was able to 
work out most of my ethnographic work. 
Whatever you may think of it, it must be 
granted that the masters' predictions do not 
always turn out to be true, which state that in 
such cases it becomes impossible to put any 
distance between oneself and the native or 
between oneself and oneself. 
Anyway, I was never able to choose between 
subjectivism and the objective method as it 
was taught me, so long, that is, as I still wished 
to find an answer to my initial question -what 
are the people involved trying to shape out 
through a witchcraft crisis one? Working in 
this way has at least preserved me from one 
limitation regularly met by the objectivizing 
ethnographer and which is never emphasized, 
since it is taken for granted: I mean the ethno­
grapher's dependence on a finite corpus of 
empirical observations and native texts col­
lected in the field. This kind of ethnography 
meets any new question with the answer that 
it is included, or not, in the corpus; it can be 
verified, or not, in the empirical data -and of 
anything not referred to in the corpus, nothing 
can be asserted. In my case, the fact that Bocage peasants forced me to come up with a 
number of statements in the same way as they 
did (i.e. to be an encoder) enabled me to break 
away from the limits of the corpus; or, and this 
comes to the same thing, to include my own 
discourse in it. For the sort of question posed 
by comparative grammarians, I was able to 
substitute that posed by transformationalists: 
can this utterance be produced or not? 
Hazarding my own words in the presence of 
native decoders, I became able to discriminate 
accepted from unacceptable meaning what ever 
the utterance and whether or not it was pro­
duced during my stay in the field. The limits 
of ordinary ethnography are those of its 
corpus. In the case of the ethnography I was 
practising, the problem was, each time, to 
evaluate correctly the limits of my position in 
speech. But my having occupied at one time or 
another all the positions in this discourse, 
knowingly or not, or willingly or not, at least 
enables me to have a view on everything that 
is statable. 
It is now time to give a little information about 
the position of the witch. No one, in the 
Bocage, calls himself a witch; it is not a posi­
tion from which one can speak. A witch never 
admits his crimes, not even when he is deliri­
ous in a psychiatric hospital (this is consider­
ably different from exotic witchcra fts). The 
witch is the person referred to by those who 
utter the discourse on witchcraft (bewitched 
and unwitchers), and he only figures in it as 
the subject of the statement. His victims claim 
that it is unnecessary for him to admit he is a 
witch, since his death speaks for him: everyone 
laughs at his funeral because he died in a sig­
nificant way, carried off in only a few hours as 
a result of the diviner's curse, or neighing like 
the mare he had cast an evil spell on, and so 
on. This makes it highly unlikely that there are 
witches who actually cast evil spells, but this 
is surely not in the least necessary for the 
system to function.
