Dialogic Editing: Interpreting 
How Kaluli Read Sound 
and Sentiment 
Steven Feld 
The word in language is half someone else's. 
-Mikhail Bakhtin 
When the writer becomes the center of his attention, he becomes a nudnik. And a nudnik 
who believes he's profound is even worse than just a plain nudnik. 
An engaging dimension of current interpretive 
ethnogra phy and its critical rhetoric is the 
concern to situate knowledge, power, author­
ity, and representation in terms of the social 
construction of literary realism. Ethnographers 
today are reading, writing, and thinking more 
about the politics of ethnographic writing. 1 
That is why I read Bakhtin; in his literary 
world, a dialogic imagination helps reposition 
ethnogra phic writing beyond its overt trajec­
tories, and toward reflexive, critical readings. 
Yet I've had a tendency to kvetch about the 
very literary genre and trend that I'm here to 
contribute to. I like the emphasis on a self­
conscious, dialectical invention of culture, bur 
I worry that the enterprise not devolve into an 
invention of the cult of the author. First-person 
narrative may be the fashionable way to write 
and critique ethnography these days, but that 
alone doesn't guarantee that the work is ethno­
graphically insightful, self-conscious, or reve­
latory. That is why, in tandem, I read Singer; -Isaac Bashevis Singer 
in his literary world, there is caution that 
first-person writing not pass as a ruse, that 
hermeneutic not pass for a mispronunciation 
of a nom de plume: Herman Nudnik. 
A Context 
This article opens to a fixed-in-print text to 
look at how a new set of readers -its original 
subjects -opened up and unfixed some of its 
meanings and repositioned its author's author­
ity. I am the author, and the text is Sound and 
Sentiment: Birds, Weeping, Poetics, and Song 
in Kaluli Expression (1982), an ethnography 
about the Kaluli people of Bosavi, Papua New 
Guinea. While I have been stimulated in this 
endeavor by previous "afterword" essays in 
Papua New Guinea ethnographies -Bateson's 
for Naven (1958), Rappap ort's for Pigs for the 
Ancestors (1984) -what follows was more 
directly inspired by a series of significant field

experiences that positioned Kaluli and me in a 
more blatant subject-to-subject relationship. 
In 1982 I returned to Papua New Guinea for 
a short summer field trip after an absence of 
five years. While I was back in Bosavi, my 
book was published; its arrival in the field, and 
my momentary fixation on it stimulated the 
Kaluli to ask about it, and stimulat ed me to 
attempt translating sections of it for discussion 
with them. This article reports on the form of 
ethnographic discourse that developed in these 
encounters. 
The "dialogic" dimension here implicates 
what Kaluli and I say to, about, with, and 
through each other; with developing a juxta­
position of Kaluli voices and my own.2 My 
focus on .. editing" invokes a concern with 
authoritative representation; the power to 
control which voices talk when, how much, 
in what order, in what language. "dialogic 
editing," then, is the impact of Kaluli voices 
on what I tell you about them in my voice; how 
their rake on my rake on them requires refram­
ing and refocusing my account. This is the 
inevitable politics of writing culture, of pro­
ducing selections and passing them off as 
authentic and genuine, and then confronting a 
recentered view of that selection process that 
both questions and comments upon the origi­
nal frame and focus. In more direct terms, my 
aim here is to let some Kaluli voices get a few 
words in edgewise amongst my other readers 
and book reviewers. 
My secondary title, "Interpreting How 
Kaluli Read Sound and Sentiment" is meant to 
implicate the work Kaluli helped me do in 
order to "write" them, and the work I had to 
do for them to ''read" that writing. I want to 
suggest that this understanding is multiply 
textual, that Kaluli perceive the coherences 
and contradictions in my representa tional 
work as being about me in similar ways to how 
I perceive the book to be written about them. 
I also want to suggest Kaluli perceive it as a 
story about themselves that they also have 
occasion to tell, a line I'll use to play off of 
Geertz's phrase situating culture as "a story 
they tell themselves about themselves" 
(1973:448 ). But Kaluli tellings are different 
from mine in arrangement, focus, intention, 
and style. I'd also suggest that my Kaluli 
readers realize as clearly as I do that all of our tellings elide and/or condense certain scenarios 
while playing out others in detail; and that 
both kinds of tellings and tellers have a com­
plicated cross-und erstanding of the way they 
speak and write with an acute awareness of 
different audiences. 
A Text 
Sound and Sentiment is an ethnography of 
sound as a cultural system, a book about 
natural and human sounds -birds, weeping, 
poetics, and song -and how they are mean­
ingfully situated in the ethos, or emotional 
tone, of Kaluli expression. The form of the 
book originates with Kaluli ideas as they are 
packed into a myth about the origin of 
weeping, poetics, and song in the plaintive 
sound of a fruitdove, the muni bird. I present 
and unpack that myth, following its structure, 
with chapters on birds, weeping, poetics, and 
song that alternate structural and cognitive 
summar ies with symbolic/performance case 
studies. In this fashion, the book continually 
moves back and forth between Kaluli idealiza­
tions, prescriptions, intentions, and actualiza­
tions, and these are played off each other by 
my juxtapositions of linguistic (from metalan­
guage to texts), musical (from form to perfor­
mance), and cultural (from ideation to action) 
analyses. 
As to what is "in., the book: Kaluli myths 
and cosmology portray birds and humans as 
transformations of each other in death and life, 
living in different planes of visible and non­
visible reality that in part "show through" to 
each other. Birds can "show through" by their 
sounds; Kaluli apprehend and relate bird 
sound categories to spirit attributions accord­
ing to which ones "whistle," "say their 
names " "talk Kaluli " "cry '' "sing " or ' ' I ' 
"make a lot of noise." The explicit link 
between bird sound and human emotional 
express10n IS first formed in the arena of 
weeping. The descending four tones of the 
muni bird call create a melodic framework 
through which women' s funerary wailing turns 
into wept song. 
While the performance of this sung-texted­
weeping evokes the image that, like the de­
ceased, the weeper too has ,. become a bird," 

DIALOGIC EDITING 419 
the switch from spontaneous to elaborately 
planned ritual expression hinges on poetics. 
Transforming the "hard words" of assertive 
discourse to the "bird sound words" of poetic 
song involves evocative linguistic strategies to 
speak "inside" the words, and to "turn them 
over" so they reveal new "underneaths." Song 
texts are organized by these devices to follow 
a "path" along a set of place-names; these 
evoke the pathos of experiences Kaluli share 
together at the places that they travel to or visit 
each day. 
These poetic "bird sound words" are then 
melded with the musical material of bird 
sound, a melodic song scale again based on the 
tones of the muni bird call. A polysemous 
lexicon of water motion names the contours of 
song melody and creates a theoretical vocabu­
lary for compositional and aesthetic discourse 
on song. To be deeply affective and to move 
members of an audience to tears, these 
"flowing" songs are then performed in a plain­
tive bird voice by a dancer costumed as a bird 
. at a waterfall. 
While these are some of the features detailed 
in the book, it is probably more to the point 
to say that my "topic" was the aesthetics of 
Kaluli emotion, or, put differently, the inven­
tion of sound as aesthetica lly organized senti­
ment. My work in Sound and Sentiment was 
to demonstrate how sound is constructed and 
interpreted as the embodiment of feelings; that 
is, as aesthetically affecting evocation in the 
Kaluli ritual performance of weeping and 
poetic song. 
Readers and Readings 
Let me now introduce some of my Kaluli 
readers and say something about how they 
read and about how they are positioned in 
relation to my ethnographic work. Virtually all 
Kaluli have seen books of some kind. (E. L.) 
Buck and Bambi Schieffelin (the researcher s 
with whom I have worked in Bosavi over the 
last ten years) and I have always had a variety 
of books around the house, and Kaluli have 
had ample opportunities to watch us read. We 
also on occasion have read out loud to Kaluli 
and have shown them pictures and illustra­
tions in books and magazines. Many Kaluli have gazed silently as we sat silently turning 
pages. A typical late afternoon interchange 
among Kaluli standing on our porches and 
looking in the windows might go like this: 
"What are they doing?" (interrupted by) 
"Nothing ... they're looking at books." 
Indeed, the word "book," which has the same 
phonological shape in English and tok pisin, 
the pidgin/creole lingua franca of urban Papua 
New Guinea (where it is spelled buk) is one of 
the few tok pisin words universally placed in 
the Kaluli loan-word lexicon at this juncture. 
Other varieties of familiarity with books 
have developed through contact Kaluli have 
had with missionaries who have been in resi­
dence since 1971. The mission people have 
done a small amount of literacy work, and a 
local school now run by the provincial gov­
ernment exists at the mission station. There are 
books in the local school, and all Kaluli know 
that the missionaries have a master book of 
their beliefs, the Bible, that they intend to 
translate into the Kaluli language. Books are 
also not entirely the domain of whites: Kaluli 
have also been read to by other Papua New 
Guineans, for example, in church by Kaluli 
and other pastors, at the school by teachers, or 
in other situations by government workers. 
Kaluli have also watched the Schieffelins 
and me type and write by hand, and they have 
asked why we do it. As an explanation we have 
all probably told them at one point or another 
that we write so that we can remember what 
they tell us, and make books ahout it that our 
own people can read. Moreover , writing and 
the handling of books is an activity clearly 
central to work we and Kaluli do together. 
When a missionary linguist went to Bosavi in 
1964 to supervise the building of a local 
airstrip and to take a first crack at the lan­
guage, he introduced the word "school" as the 
name for the activity that local people would 
do with him to teach their language. The word 
was turned into a verb, sugul-a:la:ma, "do 
school," and .. doing school" is generica lly 
what Kaluli do when they work with us.3 Part 
of school work is watching us dogo:(wanalo, 
"yellow skins," as Kaluli call us, write. One 
day Ayasilo: was helping Bambi Schieffelin 
and me recruit a new transcription assistant. 
"Doing school is very hard and goes slow," 
Ayasilo: explained to young Igale; "when you 

420 STEVEN FELD 
speak they write it and rub it out and keep 
writing it again." (The Kaluli verb for "etch" 
was semantically extended long ago to cover 
the activity of "writing.") 
Young men like Ayasilo: and Igale are not 
typical Kaluli. Both have a Papua New Guinea 
school education, are among the five or six 
Kaluli we know who speak English with mod­
erate conversational skill, and can read and 
write to a very modest extent in Kaluli, tok 
pisin, and English. Men of this sort have 
worked often with Bambi Schieffelin and me as 
linguistic transcription assistants. They have 
sophisticated senses of their own linguistic and 
cultural identities as well as substantial contact 
with outsiders and other Papua New Guineans. 
Ayasilo: and Ho:nowo: were two young men 
in this category who read Sound and Sentiment 
with me at informal and formal school ses­
sions. On occasion these men actually did read 
out loud directly from the book-passages that 
1 selected for them, knowing that there would 
be relatively few difficult words or places with 
lists or diagrams full of Kaluli words. With 
these men I speak in a continual mixture of 
Kaluli and English. 
At the other end of the spectrum of my 
readers were older Kaluli men. They typically 
have had no prolonged experience of the 
world beyond their immediate neighbors. 
What they know of the outside is what of it 
has been brought or narrated by younger 
Kaluli. With them I speak only in Kaluli. These 
men included J ubi, a Kaluli man of wisdom 
and knowledge in various realms of things 
traditional. Jubi was a particularly astute 
natural historian, and he lived through the 
whole sweep of contact experien ces from the 
mid-1930s until the present. Jubi was someone 
with whom Buck Schieffelin and I had done 
substantial schooling during each of our pre­
vious field trips. 
Somewhere in between these two poles were 
two other people. Gigio was in the same age 
range as the young men mentioned earlier, but 
he has never been to school. He is a nonliter­
ate Kaluli speaker with several experiences in 
the 1970s on labor contracts in the Papua New 
Guinea world outside Bosavi, and thus has had 
substantial contacts with Europeans and with 
other Papua New Guineans with whom he can 
communic ate in tok pisin. As a young boy, Gigio started working as a 
cook for Buck Schieffelin in 1996, and has 
held a continually expanding version of that 
position during each of our field trips over the 
last 20 years. Gigio is in many ways our closest 
confidant, friend, and barometer of everyday 
meanings and events in Bosavi. He is someone 
we talk to each day about everything from the 
weather and local garden crops to the poetics 
of ceremonial songs and linguistic nuances of 
Kaluli speech. He is enormously intelligent, 
curious, and perhaps the most knowledgeable 
interpreter to other Kaluli about what the 
"yellow skins'' are up to. 
When I returned in 1982, I found that Gigio 
had married Faile; she joined him each evening 
with the cooking and washing work, and then 
often with the conversations that we typically 
had before we all went off to sleep. Some of 
the reading sessions with Gigio also included 
Faile, a monolingual Kaluli speaker with no 
experience outside of Bosavi. Gigio also helped 
me stage my most experimental attempt to 
hear Kaluli responses to Sound and Sentiment, 
by taking a tape recorder to the comm unal 
longhouse one night and there recording dis­
cussions he prompted about the book while I 
was away at my own house. 
In summar y, the diverse social positioning of 
these five readers couples with the general 
understanding of the book-as-work-an d-object 
surveyed earlier to clarify the fact that the 
appearance of my book and the claim to Kaluli 
that I wrote it about them was not incompre­
hensible or bizarre. Now to turn to the sub­
stance of these casual and "doing school" 
readings and to some of the dialogues they 
animated. 
Before translating from the English to 
Kaluli, I started the first sessions by letting my 
Kaluli readers handle and thumb through tbe 
book. A substantial amount of time was thus 
spent discussing the book as an object, espe­
cially the amount of and kinds of black and 
white and color photographs, line drawings, 
and print. Doing this, Ho:nowo: and Ayasilo: 
noticed that there were two different kinds of 
print, standard and italics, and they ques­
ti�ned why this was so. That started the next 
dialogue in motion. 
I explained that at many places in the book 
I told an idea first in the Kaluli language (italic 

DIALOGIC EDITING 421 
print) as they had helped me write or tran­
scribe it from conversation, texts, or songs. 
Then I said the same thing in English (standard 
print) so that my people would understand it. 
I did not know a Kaluli term for "translate," 
so I simply pointed to the italic writing and 
said (in Kaluli), "Here it is written in Kaluli," 
then pointing to the standard typeface below 
said, "and then the same thing is written in 
English." Ho:nowo: pointed and said (in 
Kaluli) "So Kaluli language is written there, 
then turned around in English language 
written there below." 
I then questioned him in English and Kaluli 
about his use of this verb "turn around'' for 
the English word "translate," with two things 
in mind. First, it is ironic that in tok pisin the 
term for "translate" or "translator" is turnim 
tok. (T�e term for the tok pis in verb "turn" is 
not related and comes from English "about," 
namely, baut, bautim.) My immediate thought 
was that Ho:nowo: had directly back­
translated this Kaluli verb from the tok pisin 
. idiom turnim tok, thereby coining a literalized 
Kaluli verb for "translate." 
But another piece of lexical evidence was 
contradictory. The same Kaluli verb for "turn 
around" is used in poetic metalanguage to 
refer to a text copied in terms of major imagery 
but reformulated with new place-names and 
minor imagery. This kind of "turning around" 
is a compositional strategy for recycling 
poignant poetic phrases while dressing them 
up enough to have a fresh impact that bears 
the mark of their singer/composer. What Kaluli 
call a gisalo nodolo:, a "turned around gisalo 
song," is one that has had the text reworked 
in this way. One way to rework a gisalo text 
is to switch back and forth between the use of 
the Kaluli and Sonia languages. The latter is 
known by few Kaluli speakers, and this kind 
of textual "turning around" has the effect of 
obfuscating the message, building the poetic 
intensity until the idea is then again "turned 
around" back into Kaluli. I was taught this 
metalinguistic term and the strategy it labeled 
in 1977 when I learned to compose gisa/o, and 
I noted it in the chapter on gisalo in my book 
(1982:166). My teacher on that subject was 
principally Jubi, an older Kaluli man; it is 
highly doubtful he could have been aware of 
the tok pisin term. Therefore I had been under the impression that this "turn around" notion 
was indeed an old Kaluli compositional term 
related to nuances of linguistic similarity and 
difference, or even code-switching per se in the 
song context. 
When I mentioned this, Ho:nowo: and 
Ayasilo: both claimed that what Jubi had told 
me was correct, that "turn around" was also 
an old Kaluli way to talk about code­
switching or translation. They said they had 
not "turned" this "turn around" term from 
tok pisin back to Kaluli; that it was Kaluli to 
hedele, a "truly Kaluli word," that is, not a 
loan-word or introduction from another lan­
guage. Nevertheless, there are a variety of 
ways that "turn around" could have come 
from the tok pisin word turnin tok in the last 
thirty years, and it is doubtful whether we will 
ever really know the solution to that lexical 
puzzle.4 
But the real importance of "turning around" 
Kaluli as the ethnographer's translation work 
comes by juxtaposition with the next part of 
the story. During this discussion, Ayasilo: and 
Ho:nowo: also noticed that there was far more 
standard print than italic print in the book. I 
explained that after I translate from Kaluli to 
English, the book then uses more English to 
tell the meaning of the translation. I should 
point out that having noticed this difference, 
Ho:nowo: and Ayasilo: did not question or 
contest why there was more English than 
Kaluli. In fact, it made perfect sense to them 
that a small bit of Kaluli would have to be 
followed by a long stretch of English, because 
even once the Kaluli is directly translated 
("turned around") they assumed that it would 
take a long time to reveal ("turn over") all the 
relevant meanings ( "underneaths" ). 
During this discussion I used the Kaluli 
word hego:, which means "underneath," for 
the English word "meaning." The phrase hego: 
wido: (or wilo:) means "showed the under­
neath. "5 The implication is to lay bare the 
meaning, to indicate what might not be liter­
ally evident, to show another side of the coin, 
or, literally following the idiom, to get under 
the surface of things. The notion that mean­
ings are "underneath" surfaces is a rather fun­
damental Kaluli idea. Things are not simply 
what they appear to be; what is intended is 
always potentially far more than what is said 

422 STEVEN FELD 
or how it is said. In this context, the Kaluli 
metalinguistic label bale to, "turned over 
words," is quite apt to designate metaphors, 
obfuscations, allusions, connotations, lexical 
substitutes, and poetic devices (Feld 
1982:138-44). 
The everyday speech contrast of the two 
verbs nodoma, "turn around," and balema, 
"turn over," is revealing. One "turns around, 
objects with observably symmetrical, opposi­
tional, or discrete planes; one "turns over" 
continuous multi-surf aced objects without 
them. Replacing one language with another is 
a "turning around" of discrete items by sub­
stitution. Getting to the "underneath" of what 
is implied is "turning over" words to rotate 
or shift their multifaceted figure and ground 
possibilities. 
Ayasilo: and Ho:nowo: then told other 
Kaluli that this book for "yellow skins" is 
"turned around" and "turned over" Kaluli.6· 
They said we ethnographers are Kaluli to 
nodolesen ka/u, "Kaluli language turn around 
people," and hego: widesen kalu, "underneath 
shower people," whose books "turn around" 
Kaluli into English, and then "show the under­
neath" of the words. This rather clever image 
of the intricacies of ethnogra phic work fits, 
even if the notions of "turn around," "turn 
over," and "show the underneath" strike you 
more in the way of a kinky cross-language 
pun. After all, we may claim to benignly or 
sympatheticalJy "translate" and "interpret" 
languages and meanings, but many of our 
critics claim that this amounts to little more 
than "ripping off" or "fucking over" the lan­
guages and peoples concerned. 
Progressing to other readings, the tendency 
turned to more about the book's words rather 
than the nature of the book's work. Before dis­
cussing the details of some of these readings, a 
word about the general style of these dialogues 
is in order, The form often went like this famil­
iar scenario: You begin to recount a story, and 
without your realizing it, the story is in fact 
one your partner has already heard. Perhaps 
you previously told it to them and forgot you 
did so. Perhaps it was told to them by another 
person. Perhaps that other teller first heard it 
from you. In any case they are hearing a famil­
iar story, but being either polite, disi nterested, 
or unable or unwilling to interrupt, they let you continue the tale without letting on that it 
is redundant for them. But at some point when 
you, the telJer, pause or stumble for a word, 
your hearer provides it, and capitalizes on the 
opening to finish or close the interchange, or 
even fully situate the hearing as a second one. 
Interactions like this constituted the most 
common form of my readings with Kaluti. 
Essentially I was providing foregroundings or 
anchors or scaffoldings to things they knew 
well; they would dive in and remind me of the 
workings and outcomes of it all, as if I were 
unaware of them, had forgotten the� or as if 
to remind me that we'd been over this ground 
before. Other times my translations might be 
slow or halting; a second spent stumbling 
around for a word or mispronouncing it is all 
it took to animate a Kaluli hearer. 
Part of this was simply a matter of excite­
ment and of Kaluli interactional styles, many 
of which seem governed by the maxim: Always 
maintain intensity; don't hold back. Kaluli 
interactions, with outsiders and Kaluli com­
panions, often come across as animated, sharp, 
bubbly. This is a key feature of Kaluli asser­
tion (E. L. Schieffelin 1967:118-26; B. B. 
Schieffelin 1979:141-3). Borrowing some hip­
hop argot from Grandmaster Blaster, many 
KaJuJi don't hesitate to 
cap your rap, 
seal your deal, 
steal your meal 
while you spin your wheel 
Indeed, it does not take long to figure our 
that Kaluli are quick to speak up and quicker 
to interrupt. You don't have to be like me, 
Jewish and from the urban Northeast, to enjoy 
and engage in Kaluli interactions, but I think 
it helps, particularly in terms of interpreting 
the subtleties of this lively interpersonal and 
verbal style as collaborative engagement rather 
than pushy abrasiveness (a not-so-uncomm on 
attribution made both about Jews and Papua 
New Guinea Highlanders). 
In any case, a good amount of interruption, 
side and splinter conversation, overlapped 
speech, and direct or challenging polyphonic 
discourse is common in Kaluli interaction, 
whether light or heated. And in this marked 
context I felt like I was often able to say no 

DIALOGIC EDITING 423 
more than a few words before Kaluli would 
steal the moment, elaborate the tale, or 
provide the punchline without any of the 
buildup. Often I was left with the sense of 
"what you meant to say was ... , before I 
knew what hit me. 
Yet the form of these interchanges went 
beyond the use of my utterances as precaden­
tial formulae, aide-memoires, or Rorschach 
stimuli for willing rap-cappers. The much 
more interesting outcome of this was that even 
when I was able to get a fair amount of my 
story told, my Kaluli readers essentially re­
constituted portions or versions of source 
materials in my field nares upon hearing them 
summarized, capsuled, or stripped of their 
situated details. Kaluli took my stories and 
resituated them as their own as they had once 
before. To do that, they took every generality 
I offered and worked it back to an instance, an 
experience, a remembered activity or action. In 
effect, they "turned over" my story by provid­
ing recountings of the stories that more typi­
cally are left behind in my field notes, the 
stories I otherwise mined in order to report 
Kaluli "underneaths'' to my own "yellow 
skin" constituen cy. 
More pointedly, the abstracting, deperson­
alizing, sumrnanzmg, and generalizing 
moments that appear in my ethnography 
unanchored to specific instances, attributions, 
and intentions are the ones that Kaluli readers 
most often responded to with a concretizing 
and repersonalizing set of questions, side com­
ments, or interpretations. On the tapes from 
the evening when Gigio took my tape recorder 
to the longhouse, the most common interjec­
tions are: "who said that?" and "who told him 
that?" It was that desire to situate knowledge 
and experience with specific actors, agendas, 
and instances that was most on my Kaluli 
readers' minds. 
An example of this sort of contestation was 
evidenced both in the readings of the chapter 
on gisalo songs and the comments about that 
chapter that Gigio recorded. That chapter con­
tains a case history of a song sung through a 
spirit medium during a seance. The medium 
was a man from a distant communit y, and the 
seance took place at Nageba:da:n, a commu­
nity an hour or so away from Sululib, our 
home. Additional ly, the initial transcriptions of the songs were done with the help of Kulu, 
a young man who was also from a distant 
commun ity, and most of the exegetic com­
mentary, responses, and ethnographic infor­
mation that went into my characterization 
came from work 1 did with the medium and 
with people from Nageba:da:n who were at 
the event. Few people from Sululib experi­
enced the event, although many had heard the 
tape recordings. 
The discussions then constantly involved 
quizzing me about who told me what and, one 
way or another, mildly challenged the author­
ity involved. Direct and veiled accusations that 
the medium was a fraud and that my tran­
scription assistant was a Christian who didn't 
really understand the "turned over words" of 
the songs were mixed with queries as to 
whether Buck and various people from 
Nageba:da:n also agreed with what I said, and 
suggestions that I really should have discussed 
a song sung during a seance at Sululib by 
another medium everyone (including Buck and 
me) knew was a better performer. 
Another example involved my characteriza­
tion of male and female styles of weeping. The 
second chapter of the book contains a met­
alinguistic, strucrural, and behavioral srare­
ment of the dimensions of contrasts that 
differentiate these styles. When we read this 
material, my readers immediately complic ated 
the generalizations I offered, largely related to 
events we experienced together , as if to ques­
tion my memory. They recalled that most of 
my experiences of weeping derived from funer­
als that took place when I initially arrived in 
Bosavi. Hearing their comments was like 
reading my field notes. In other words, they set 
their explications in the context of specific 
events, actors, and actions, and constantly 
asked who had told me one thing or another. 
Field notes, of course, attend to such on-the­
spot actions and situations in a way that 
pattern overviews typically do not. 
The problem of compacting and compress­
ing instances, structuralizing their form, and 
presenting them pulled away from the biogra­
phies and practices in which they were embed­
ded is no minor problem in the critique of 
ethnographies. So how do we understand the 
obvious differences of the account and its read­
ings? One way is to claim that they are fairly 

424 STEVEN FELD 
superficial. For example, there is always a dif­
ference in degrees of remove from situated 
experiences. And book work implicates style; 
the writer must select, edit, compress some­
thing. Investment and salience are also differ­
ent; the ethnographer more typically accounts 
for self-investment and the reported invest­
ments of many Others rather than the single 
perspective of any one actor, any one Other. 
Different audiences also implicate different 
expectations. 
An alternative is to suggest that Kaluli have 
given me a critique and lesson in poststruc­
turalist method; that they have exposed a deep 
problem about (my) ethnography , and not a 
superficial one. A more cynical reaction would 
be to claim that all I have shown is that my 
KaluJi commentators are stuck in a world of 
the concrete (or stuck in the forest mud) and 
that this is precisely why an ethnographer is 
necessary -to tell "the point" of it all. Surely 
Sound and Sentiment is not intended as 
unmediated copy of "the native point of view." 
I think that few ethnographers these days 
would quibble with Geertz's (1976) assertion 
that ethnographies are supposed to be what we 
ethnographers think about things as much as 
they are supposed to be accounts of what we 
think the locals think they are doing. 
Up against these possibilities, my own take 
on the interpretive moves of my readers is 
more local. I don't think that Kaluli readings 
of my ethnography are poststructuralist and 
praxis-centered, or that Kaluli are really 
"grounded," unable or unwilling to abstract 
what is going on in a way anything like mine. 
I also don't think that the issues here are easily 
resolved by just attributing them to differences 
of writing and audience. Part of my reasoning 
turns on the next layer of readings. 
When I was reading with Gigio and Faile 
from the material in my chapter on women's 
weeping and recounting there the weeping by 
Hane sulo: over the death of Bibiali at 
Aso:ndo:, Gigio quickly interrupted, giggling 
slightly, asking if I had told the story of my trip 
to Aso:ndo: to record the weeping and of my 
unexpected overnight stay there. I told him 
that I had not, and he was truly puzzled by 
that. 
He then quickly began to recount in great 
detail how I had only been at Sululjb for one month, how it was my first trip away from the 
village without Buck or Bambi, how I barely 
spoke Kaluli, how they had left me in the 
hands of a guy named Kogowe, instructing 
rum to return with me the same day, how many 
people thought Kogowe was a bit flaky and 
unreliable, how everyone started speculating 
on why I wasn't home when it turned dark, 
how upset Bambi was that Kogowe might have 
gotten lost leading me back, how there was 
one really bad river bridge to cross on the way, 
how it had rained heavily all afternoon so 
maybe the river flooded or I slipped on a log 
and fell in, how Buck managed to gather up 
Hasele and Seyaka for the miserable task of 
walking with rum through the forest at night, 
two-and-a-half hours from Sululib to 
Aso:ndo:, and how when they got there, they 
just found me resting comfortably by the fire 
with a mild stomach ache. 
And Gigio went on to tell how we stayed up 
that night and listened to the tapes with the 
mourners at Aso:ndo:, and then walked back 
home the next morning at the crack of dawn, 
and how everyone playfully teased Kogowe 
about getting lost, while Kogowe kept protest­
ing that after starting out in the heavy rain the 
new "yellow skin" kept falling down, stopping 
him in order to fix the plastic bags protecting 
the tape recorder case, and at each instance of 
a fall or stop turnjng yellower , as if he would 
puke any minute. 
Gigio told this very dramatically and had 
Faile and me in stitches. But it was more than 
an amusing story about embarrassing 
moments in the lives of the ''yellow skins." It 
was Gigio saying, on the "underneath": "This 
is what good stories are made of; so why didn't 
you tell it?" Here we were beyond the more 
typical routine of Kaluli hearers trying to posi­
tion my account in terms of what other J(aluli 
speakers said, thought, or told me. Now I was 
hearing Gigio criticize me for not putting 
enough of myself in the book. I found this at 
once a recogn ition that Gigio read the book as 
my story as much as anyone else's, but also 
that the concern with positioned Kaluli speak­
ers and their biographical accountability was 
np different for "yellow skins.'' 
Later on there were a number of similar 
instances of asking why I didn't tell my stories. 
I couldn't say to Kaluli that I simply didn't tell 

DIALOGIC EDITING 425 
my stories more because I often felt them to be 
unimportant sources for illuminating the 
Kaluli stories I was trying to tell. So I defended 
myself by reading with them certain sections 
of the book where I am more clearly situated 
in the story. But what was always at issue in 
these dialogues was the need for a personally 
situated point of view. My sense here is that 
Kaluli readings of Sound and Sentiment key 
closely on their sense of biographies, because 
biographies frame what is memorable about 
experiences. They extend that concern to all 
stories, tellers and tellings, even if they don't 
imagine that other meanings might be assigned 
to them beyond the ones they momentarily 
have at hand. I think Kaluli assume that what 
they find memorable about me is also some­
thing that I should be able to recognize. And 
it is perplexing that I might ignore such an 
obvious fact in the context of writing about 
events and times we shared. 
One other Kaluli cultural framework helps 
make sense of this issue; namely, a clear model 
for this kind of storytelling is neither myth nor 
historical narrative, but song. There are two 
reasons for that. One is that Kaluli assume that 
I know what songs are about and how they are 
constructe d. Another is that song poetics are 
the height of an aesthetic evocation of the 
meaning of shared experiences. Kaluli song 
poetics simultaneously reference abstract qual­
ities and values, and personal situations and 
experiences, particularly poignant ones. Since 
the book so deeply concerned such questions, 
I found that as time and readings progressed, 
Kaluli seemed to absorb and respond to it as 
a kind of meta-gisalo song, an evocation about 
evocation, a map of shared experiences about 
other maps of shared experiences. 
In part, the book readings (particularly the 
chapters on poetics and song) were greeted like 
any Kaluli performance meant to move an 
audience, a performance intended to commu­
nicate to that audience the skill, care, and 
affective sensibilities of the composer/per­
former. And after the fact, I realized that 
during our reading sessions my companions 
frequently acted exactly the way Kaluli act at 
performances, rather than the way they act 
when we "do school." They often mixed side 
comments, wild interjections and exuberant 
chuckles, quiet clucks accompanied by down-cast head turning (as if to say "this is heavy 
stuff"), feigned distraction and disinterest, 
intense concentration and engagement, and 
puns, put-ons and joking rounds playing off a 
passing verbal phrase or two. 
As a maner of fact, there were instances in 
the readings of my chapter on gisalo songs 
when Gigio, Ho:nowo:, and Ayasilo: all went 
into silly mock weeping routines, as if both 
the recounting of a powerful song and my 
sung/spoken rendition of it had moved them 
to tears the way a real gisalo performance 
might well do. At one point I read Gigio the 
section recounting the time I composed a song 
about my loneliness over Buck and Bambi's 
departure, telling how it brought tears to his 
eyes. He playfully mocked weeping and limply 
fell over onto me, the way weepers at a cere­
mony throw their arms around the dancer they 
have just burned in retribution for a song that 
moved them to tears. Then he popped up and 
burst out laughing hysterically , exclaiming 
Yagidi ni Sidif-o!, as if to say "this is too much, 
Steve!" 
What I think was going on there was the 
negotiation of a playful frame for a moment 
recalling shared experiences whose original 
experiential frames were emotionally highly 
charged. In a certain sense this was probably 
the most genuine and natural way for Gigio to 
take the book seriously , to communicate a pos­
itive and friendly aesthetic response to me, and 
to act perfectly Kaluli about the whole maner. 
In other words, Gigio knew that the way to 
greet my telling was not with a casual "that's 
good" or "yes, it was truly like that." Such 
responses would be distanced, impersonal, 
uncharacteristic of our relationship, (and 
something that I would read as "informant 
behavior "). Gigio's manner of response was a 
way to say "we can laugh about the heaviness 
we shared." This Kaluli way to reaffirm the 
power of shared feelings and experiences is not 
uncommon; instances of mock weeping are 
often invoked to convey expressions of cama­
raderie and affection among young Kaluli 
men. 
Another way to help illuminate the dynam­
ics of Kaluli interpretive style here is to focus 
on the parts of Sound and Sentiment thar 
seemed to be read most easily and success­
fully, and the ones that seemed to be most 

426 STEVEN FELD 
troublesome. Most successfully read were my 
telling of the muni bird myth, material in the 
chapter on birds, and much of the material in 
the chapter on song poetics. Less successful 
were some of the things in the chapters on 
weeping and song. This puzzled me because, 
with the exception of the ornithological mate­
rials, it reverses what I said earlier about a 
preference for the concrete. Indeed, the 
weeping and song chapters had the longest and 
most specifically situated case histories in 
them, whereas the myth and poetics materials 
were more often structurally compacted. 
In the case of the weeping and song materi­
als, which in the book include a full tran­
scription, translation, involved case history, 
and explication for individual performances, 
the problems involved the nature of providing 
a context for a microanalysis, the nature of 
which item was selected for such intense treat­
ment, and the fact that neither of these majo_r 
case studies come from events that took place 
in my home village. 
For example, with the gisalo song, Gigio 
was quick to remind me that it was an early 
one in a larger seance that included 13 songs. 
For Gigio this was not in fact the most mem­
orable of all the songs. He was also right that 
a later song that also moved the same man to 
tears came at a more climactic moment in the 
overaH seance, and that the later song was also 
Ionge�; more poetically complicated, and 
moved several other people to tears as well. 
My real dilemma here was that Gigio was not 
only right about all of these things, but that 
Aiba, the medium, Neono, a man who wept 
for both songs, and all the original consultants 
both from Nageba:da:n and Sululib told me 
exactly the same thing in 1977. I agreed then, 
and still do now, that the later song was 
more forceful (though no more typical of 
the genre) from musical-poetic-performative 
standpoints. But my choice of the song that 
appears in the book derived entirely from 
other considerations. 
For example, the later song was almost 
one-and-a-half rimes as long as the earlier one, 
and involved linguistic, poetic, and pragmatic 
factors that would have required a much more 
extended discussion in the book. The multi­
plicity of agendas embodied in that song and 
the seance activity surrounding it meant that I could not have explained it clearly without dis� 
cussing the larger event and its participants in 
greater detail. Also, I ran out of rape in the 
middle of that song, and the change of reels 
deletes about 30 seconds where I am not 
entirely sure of the text. Even though I worked 
with several people on that issue and have a 
pretty good idea of exactly what was included 
in the untaped verse, the situation was not 
ideal, because I wanted to publish the analyzed 
song on a record {as I have, Feld 1985) so that 
my readers could relate the performance to my 
description and analysis of it. Moreover, I was 
not really concerned with a discussion of the 
most powerful gisalo from this or any other 
single event, but simply with one that worked 
well to typify the style and the performance 
issues, and could accommodate my concern 
to integrate a case study into a larger socio­
musical discussion of the genre. 
Likewise, Gigio and Ho:nowo: were quick 
to point out that the sa-ya:lab weeping 
example that I picked for close scrutiny was 
done by a single woman. Indeed, sa-ya:lab are 
more typically wept by two to five women 
simultaneously . And there were other ways in 
which Hane sulo:'s long sa-ya:lab was not 
typical: it was more songlike than many, more 
poetically complicated, less ordinary, more 
profoundly moving. Here we have the inverse 
of the problem with the gisalo song selection. 
I picked what everyone agreed was the most 
forceful of the sa-ya:lab performances I had 
recorded for my case study only to be told 
{again, as I had been told before and knew 
well) that there were ways in which it was nor 
entirely representative. 
What I found interesting in these discussions 
was not that my readers were contesting my 
selection. Rather, it was that they were 
responding in real Kaluli style. Kaluli men 
seem to assume that whether or not they have 
anything substantial to say, or are explicitly 
asked their opinion, they are expected to have 
one, and expected to be ready with it and 
entirely up-front about asserting it. A premium 
is placed on having something to say, on saying 
it as a form of collaboration, and on engaging 
demonstrati vely. Talk is not only a primary 
measure of Kaluli social competence, but an 
arena for the display of intelligent interactive 
style, what Kaluli call halaido, "hardness" 

DIALOGIC EDmNG 427 
(Feld and B. B. Schieffelin 1982). If my readers 
were giving me "a hard time," it was in their 
cultural idiom, and not mine. 
Gigio and Ho:nowo: never told me that 
I was "wrong," never proposed explicit 
changes, nor indicated that I should have said 
things differently. That wouJd be too trivial a 
response and out of character. Their discus­
sions opened issues rather than resolved them, 
and their comments were filled with sentences 
that opened or closed with classic Kaluli 
hedges, hede ko:sega, "true, but ... ,, and 
a:la:fo: ko:sega, "like that, however ... " The 
pragmatics of these very typical Kaluli phrases 
are complex, not just in terms of whether they 
open or close an utterance, but also in terms 
of how they work to always keep the conver­
sation moving. 
What Gigio and Ho:nowo: did say about my 
editorial policy was also very Kaluli; they occa­
sionally responded to my assertions with a 
terse but semantically complicated Kaluli term, 
ko:le, "different." Sometimes this term can 
. and should be taken at face value, a neutral 
and direct "oh, that's different." The term also 
can be distancing, carrying the sense of "well, 
OK, but that's your thing." It can also carry a 
very positive sense of different, a sort of "far 
out, I never it saw it that way before." It can 
also imply a rather bland "different," carrying 
the sense of "I suppose you could see it that 
way." Or a more evaluatively suspect "that's 
different." Even when attending carefully to 
syntax, conversational context, intonation, 
and paralinguistics, it is not easy to get a single 
semantic reading when Kaluli use this term. 
My intuition is that the term more often 
frames multiple or ambiguous attitudes rather 
than singular ones in any case. Here it seemed 
that Gigio and Ho:nowo: used it in virtually 
every way with me, creating a continually 
mixed feeling of acceptance and challenge. 
As for the easier read sections, I went over 
all of the bird taxonomy , symbolism, and 
stories in real detail with Jubi. He was perhaps 
the best ornithologist in Bosavi, and had 
worked longest and hardest, at one point 
almost everyday for five straight months, with 
me on the bird materials originall y. I was inter­
ested in his reading, and interested to see how 
similar or different his interpretations would 
be five years later. In about a week's time we went through the whole chapter; he corrected 
me on about four or five identifications that I 
had botched, elaborated others, insisted that I 
had "forgotten" certain things, but basically 
gave me the sense that my bird portrayal was 
fairly complete and accurate in terms of his 
knowledge and understanding. 
It was clear, however , from Jubi and others, 
that I had not gone far enough in stating that 
classification of birds by sound was more 
typical of Kaluli everyday use and knowledge, 
and more salient than the detailed classifica­
tion by beaks and feet to which I had devoted 
so much formal lexical attention. And if I had 
it to do over, I think that a restructuring of the 
way those two classifications are presented 
would be in order. Also, more attention to 
other bird myths would be in order, as I found 
that Jubi invoked them often, as he had done 
in the past, in order to explain the "under­
neaths" of bird colors, sounds, and behaviors. 
In any case, what was most successful here 
was the organization of the material in terms 
of metalinguistically and culturally focused 
Kaluli domains. 
Similarly, what was successful to all my 
readers in the materials on poetics and song 
structure was the orderly presentation of 
things following the Kaluli metalinguistic 
demarcations. Like the ornitholo gical materi­
als, sections of the book framed by Kaluli 
domains led my readers to act as if my role in 
the presentation were more secretarial than 
"turn around"/"turn over." Set in that light, 
the isolated phrases from songs as examples 
were questioned less for being taken out of 
context. There were plenty of instances here 
that led me to feel justified in believing and 
stating that Kaluli can and do think quite 
abstractly and theoretically about song form, 
composition, and poetic construction as a kind 
of symbolic persuasion. 
Dialogic Editing of 
Another Kind 
I thought my most radical move in Sound and 
Sentiment consisted in simultaneously stress­
ing the theoretical importance of sound (as dis­
tinct from music or language per se) and its 
situated importance in understanding how 

428 STEVEN FELD 
Kaluli constructed and interpreted their 
expressive modes. It turned out that this was 
read as rather less adventurous by both Gigio 
and Jubi. They were taken by how much time 
I had spent discussing a single song and a 
single weeping episode, but then how much 
less I had spent talking about the more 
mundane daily sounds - the ones that tell the 
weather, season of year, rime of day. They 
asked why I told so much about birds but so 
little about frogs, about insects, different 
animals. They asked why I had told the muni 
bird myth and nor told many others. They 
asked why I had not told about how all sounds 
in the forest are mama, "reflections" of what 
is unseen. I responded that I thought birds 
were most important; they had more stories, 
there were more of them, Kaluli ane mama, 
"gone reflections" (spirits of dead) more often 
show through as birds, and so on. They did 
not dispute this; they simply made it clear that 
every sound was a "voice in the forest" and 
that I should tell about them all. 
The responses of Jubi and Gigio to the 
emphasis on weeping, poetics, and song, and 
to the ethnolirerary device of the case example 
made it clear to me that there was a gap 
between my emphasis on the meaning of 
Kaluli-p erformed human sounds and the kind 
of practical and affective everyday interaction 
with environmental sound that more deeply 
grounds the specific aesthetic and performative 
arenas that I focused upon. 
My main response to this was to record 
more everyday sounds, usually on early 
morning and late afternoon treks each day in 
the surrounding bush with Jubi, and then to 
have playback sessions where I would let the 
tape recorder run and simply invite people to 
sit around and listen. I also stayed up all night 
on several occasions to record nighttime forest 
sounds, and tried to get Kaluli to identify and 
discuss all of them. What 1 was tying to do here 
was to create a pool of sensate material from 
which Kaluli and I could have different kinds 
of discussions from the ones we more typically 
had about linguistic, poetic, and musical mate­
rial. My hope was that this kind of refocused 
activity could lead to better realizations about 
the nature of sound, particularly at the level of 
everyday Kaluli meanings and interpret ations. The dialogues that followed made it clear 
that the sociomusical metaphors I had earlier 
identified in discourse about human sound 
are thoroughly grounded in natural sounds. 
For example, dulugu ganalan, "lift-up­
over-sounding," is an important concept in 
Kaluli song form and performance. It turns out 
to also be the most general term for natural 
sonic form. Unison or discretely bounded 
sounds nowhere appear in nature; all sounds 
are dense, multilay ered, overlapping, alternat· 
ing, and interlocking. The constantly changing 
figure and ground of this spatio-acoustic 
mosaic is a "lift-up-over -sounding" texture 
without gaps, pauses, or breaks. 
This key image clarifies how the soundscape 
evokes "insides" and "underneaths (sa and 
he go:) and "reflections" (mama). These 
notions involve perceptions, changes of focus 
and frame, motions of interpretive access to 
meanings packed into layers of sensation as 
they continually 'lift-up-over" one another. It 
is not just that the forest is the abode of invis­
ible spir its; it is that all sounds invite contem­
plation because their juxtaposition and 
constant refiguring make it possible to mildly 
or intensely interpret presences. 
"Lift-up-over-sounding" sounds and tex­
tures disperse, pulse, rearrange. This constant 
motion is also an energy, a "hardness" that 
comes together and that "flows," remaining in 
one's thought and feelings. In song poetics, 
"making hard" (ha/aido doma:ki) is the image 
of competent formation; it is force, persuasion, 
the attainment of an energized evocative state. 
The holding power of that "hardened" state is 
its "flowing" (a:ba:lan), the sensation that 
sounds and feelings stay with you after they 
have been heard or performed. 
What to do with these new understandings 
and new sounds? I had already produced two 
sampler phonograph discs illustrating all 
Kaluli song and instrumental styles (Feld 
1981, 1985). The first of these contained an 
8-minute-long unbroken stretch of Kaluli 
talking, singing, and whooping recorded 
during garden clearing work. But this brief 
attempt to place Kaluli soundmaking in the 
environmental context does not contain exam­
ples of the interplay of human and natural 
sounds (like singing and whistling with birds 

DIALOGIC EDITING 429 
and insects) that I recorded in 1982. I decided 
rhat an extended version of this kind of record­
ing would make it possible to illustrate the 
interaction of environmental sounds and 
Kaluli aesthetic sensibilities at the everyday, 
nonritual/ceremonial level. That led to the con­
ception of Voices in the Forest, a tape record­
ing depicting a day in the life of the Kaluli and 
their tropical rain forest home.7 This tape 
attempts an editing dialogue with sounds in 
order to work more reflexively with Kaluli in 
a sensate idiom so naturally their own. 
When fieldworkers make tape recordings 
and select a representative set of materials for 
publication or presentation, they generally 
follow certain realist conventions of sound as 
a mode of ethnographic representa tion. In 
these practices I think it fair to claim that the 
typical mode of tape editing and use is literal 
and descriptive; more important, bounded and 
discrete. The on/off switch or the fade up/fade 
down potentiometer of the tape machine 
marks a control over the finiteness of a 
recorded item. What comes in between the on 
and the off or the fade up and the fade down 
is itself expected to be whole, unmanipu lated, 
unviolated. In other words, we expect a tape 
excerpt or a record band to be a true sonic 
index of the temporal stretch it occupies. 
Assurances that what we hear in that tempo­
ral stretch has not been spliced, cut, rear­
ranged, altered, filtered, mixed, or otherwise 
edited are part of the guarantees of a record­
ing's authenticity. 
The kind of selection and editing necessary 
to construct Voices in the Forest is of a differ­
ent sort. While it is a sound construction that 
is both narrative and realist in convention, it 
is closer in concept and execution to musique 
concrete than ethnomusicological tape display. 
Irs form is accomplished by editing sounds. 
While it displays a concern with both ethno­
graphic representativeness and audio accuracy, 
this concern is realized compositionally rather 
than literally. In this sense it owes much to R. 
Murray Schafer (1977) and the World Sound­
scape Project's concern that soundscape 
research be presented as musical composition. 
To make Voices in the Forest I selected three 
hours of source material from about 60 hours 
of recordings made in 1976-7 and 1982.8 The selected materials were arranged according to 
various graphs (again, modeled in part on 
Schafer's work) made in the field. These plot 
the pattern and interaction of daily human and 
natural sound cycles and have the names of the 
sound sources as well as Kaluli commentaries 
about them, noted at the time of recording or 
during playback sessions. These selections rep­
resent the typical cycle of sounds during a 24-
hour period, patterned from a human point of 
view. In other words, the progression of 
sounds follows the progression of general 
Kaluli activities in the village and surrounding 
forest settings. The recording then attempts ro 
present a participan t's spatiotemporal ear­
perspective. 
Once the materials were arranged, no scissor 
cuts were made. Editing was accomplished by 
rerecording slices of the source material 
directly onto an eight-track recorder, using 
three sets of stereo tracks and two monaural 
ones. The eight tracks were then mixed down 
to two, continuously cross-fading to create the 
illusion of seamless narrative. In this way the 
sounds sampled from a 24-hour period are 
condensed to 30 minutes, beginning with the 
early morning hours, progressing through 
dawn in the village, morning and midday work 
in the forest, an afternoon rain storm back in 
the village, dusk and settling in for the night, 
and returning to the night and early morning 
hours. 
As a sound object, Voices in the Forest is a 
mixed genre: experimental ethnography and 
musical composition. Its sources of inspiration 
include a variety of non-Kaluli notions that 
condition my perception of sound as an envi­
ronmental sensorium. Nature recordings (like 
Jean-Claude Roche's extraordinary series 
L'oiseau musicien), environmental composi­
tions (like R. Murray Schafer's Music for 
Wilderness Lake), and experiments in inter­
species communication (like Jim Nollman's 
underwater guitar duos with dolphins) have all 
been interesting to me in this regard; they tell 
cultural stories about nature. 
Voices in the Forest also tells this kind of 
story, using Kaluli directorial participat ion and 
my technical skills to complement each other. 
Here multitrack recording becomes the eth­
noaesthetic means to achieve a Kaluli "lift-up-

430 STEVEN FELD 
over-sounding" and "flowing� sound object 
full of "insides� and "'underneaths" that speak 
to the "hardness" of Kaluli stylistic coherence, 
and to its "reflection" in my appreciation. 
The main thing I have learned from the 
�-perience of recording the sounds, discussing 
them in the field, and editing Voices in the 
Forest is that for Kaluli, the nature of sounds 
is far more deeply grounded in the sounds of 
nature than I had previously realized. In other 
words, Kaluli culture rationalizes nature's 
sound as its own, then "turns it over" to 
project it in the form of what is •natural" and 
what is "human nature." This is the link 
between a perception of a sensate, lived-in 
world and the invention of an expressive sen­
sibility. "Lift-up-over- sounding" sounds that .. harden" and "flow," producing a sense of 
"insides," "undernea ths," and "reflections" 
reproduce in Kaluli cultural form the sense 
that nature is natural, and that being Kaluli 
means being aesthetically "in it" and "of it." 
This is both the background and stage for 
Kaluli expressive styles, the natural condition 
and world-sense that makes it possible for bird 
sound, weeping, poetics, and song to be so 
inextricably linked, not just in mythic imagi· 
nation and ritual performance, but throughout 
the forest and in the treetops at the same time. 
While dia logic editing of the first kind 
mostly taught me how Kaluli felt the "under­
neath" of Sound and Sentiment needs more 
sentiment, the second kind made it possible for 
us to work together to "harden" the sound.
